I AM DELIGHTED TO HAVE THIS  GREAT HONOR OF BEING HERE AND HAVING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU.  I WANT TO THANK THE NATIONAL COMMANDER.  THANK YOU, COMMANDER BARNETT. I WANT TO THANK YOUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. I WANT TO THANK A LONGTIME FRIEND AND ADVISOR TO ME, SOMEONE WHOM I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO, AND THAT IS YOUR NATIONAL TREASURE. MOST OF ALL, THANKS TO YOU, ALL THE LEGIONNAIRES HERE AND ACROSS  AMERICA. THANKSF FOR YOUR SERVICE IN OUR ARMED SERVICES. YOU WORE A UNIFORM, TOOK AN  OATH, PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE  TO PROTECT THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH.   SOME MAY ARGUE  WITH THAT, BUT NOT AROUND ME. WHEN YOU CAME HOME, YOU JOINED  THE AMERICAN LEGION, AND BY  DOING SO, YOU KEPT SERVING. JUST LOOK AT WHAT THE LEGION  DOES. YOU CARE FOR WOUNDED WARRIORS. YOU HELP RAISE THE NEXT  GENERATION OF AMERICAN PATRIOTS.  I WANT TO GIVE A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO BOY'S NATION, WHICH MEANT  TO SO MUCH TO MY HUSBAND WHEN HE  WAS GROWING UP.  WHEN I TOLD HIM I WAS COMING  YEAR TODAY, HE SAID, YOU HAVE  GOT TO MENTION BOY'S NATION.  I TOLD HIM I WOULD, BUT I WOULD  ALSO HAVE TO MENTION GIRL'S  NATION, TOO.   I WANT TO THANK YOUR AUXILIARY, THE WORLD'S  LARGEST WOMEN'S PATRIOTIC SERVICE ORGANIZATION.   I WAS HONORED TO  RECEIVE THE AUXILIARY'S PUBLIC  SPIRIT AWARD IN 1987, AND I  HAVE GREAT ADMIRATION FOR THE  WORK YOU DO.  AS THE DAUGHTER OF A VETERAN, AS  A PROUD AMERICAN, I AM GRATEFUL  TO YOU ALL. NOW I AM NOT GOING TO TALK A LOT  ABOUT POLITICS TODAY, THAT I DO  WANT TO SAY THIS -- WHOEVER AMERICA ELECTS THIS FALL WON'T  JUST BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, THAT  PERSON WILL BE OUR NEXT  COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. AND EVERY PERSON IN THIS ROOM UNDERSTANDS HOW GREAT A RESPONSIBILITY THAT IS. NOW I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE  DEMOCRATS AND SOME OF YOU ARE  REPUBLICANS AND SOME OF YOU ARE INDEPENDENTS -- I SUPPOSE THERE  ARE SOME OF YOU WHO HAVE NEVER  VOTED FOR A DEMOCRAT BEFORE.  I GET THAT. MY DAD WAS A ROCK RIBBED REPUBLICAN, BUT I LEARNED AT OUR  DINNER TABLE THAT WE CAN DISAGREE WITHOUT BEING DISAGREEABLE. AND --    I WANT YOU TO KNOW, IF I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WIN THIS ELECTION, I WILL BE A PRESIDENT FOR DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, FOR PEOPLE WHO VOTE FOR ME, FOR  PEOPLE WHO DON'T, FOR ALL  AMERICANS. THAT IS WHAT I THINK WE NEED.  WE NEED TO UNIFY OUR COUNTRY AND  GO FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE WITH  CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM.   TODAY, I WANT YOU  TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHERE I STAND AND HOW I SEE THE WORLD  AND AMERICA'S PLACE IN IT. I SPENT FOUR YEARS AS YOUR SECRETARY OF STATE, EIGHT YEARS BEFORE THAT AS SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF NEW YORK, SIX YEARS ON THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE. IF THERE IS ONE CORE BELIEF THAT  HAS GUIDED AND INSPIRED ME EVERY  STEP OF THE WAY, IT IS THIS -- UNITED STATES IS AN EXCEPTIONAL  NATION. I BELIEVE WE ARE STILL LINCOLN'S LAST BEST HOPE OF EARTH, STILL REAGAN'S SHINING CITY ON A HILL, STILL ROBERT KENNEDY'S GREAT, UN  SELFISH, COMPASSIONATE COUNTRY. AND IT IS NOT JUST THAT WE HAVE  THE GREATEST MILITARY OR THAT  OUR ECONOMY IS LARGER THAN ANY ON EARTH, IT IS ALSO THE  STRENGTH OF OUR VALUES, THE  STRENGTH OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. EVERYONE WHO WORKS HARDER, DREAMS BIGGER, AND NEVER, EVER STOPS TRYING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY  AND THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. AND PART OF WHAT MAKES AMERICA AN EXCEPTIONAL NATION IS THAT WE  ARE ALSO AN INDISPENSABLE NATION.  IN FACT, WE ARE THE INDISPENSABLE NATION. PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD LOOK TO US AND FOLLOW OUR LEAD. MY FRIENDS, WE ARE SO LUCKY TO  BE AMERICANS. IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY BLESSING. IT IS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE FROM SO  MANY PLACES WANT TO BE AMERICANS, TOO. BUT IT IS ALSO A SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITY. THE DECISIONS WE MAKE AND THE  ACTIONS WE TAKE, EVEN THE  ACTIONS WE DON'T TAKE, AFFECT  MILLIONS, EVEN BILLIONS, OF  LIVES.  YOU KNOW THAT.  YOU HAVE SEEN IT. NOW ALL OF THIS MAY SEEM EVIDENT, ESPECIALLY TO MEN AND  WOMEN WHO HAVE WORN THE UNIFORM. YOU MAY WONDER HOW ANYONE COULD DISAGREE. BUT, IN FACT, MY OPPONENT IN  THIS RACE HAS SAID VERY CLEARLY  THAT HE THINKS AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM IS INSULTING TO  THE REST OF THE WORLD. IN FACT, WHEN VLADIMIR PUTIN, OF  ALL PEOPLE, CRITICIZED AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, MY OPPONENT AGREED WITH HIM, SAYING, ""SECURING RUSSIA -- IF YOU ARE  IN RUSSIA, YOU DO NOT WANT TO  HEAR THAT AMERICA IS EXCEPTIONAL ."" WELL, MAYBE YOU DO NOT WANT TO  HEAR IT, BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN  IT IS NOT TRUE. MY OPPONENT MISSES SOMETHING IMPORTANT. WHEN WE SAY AMERICA IS EXCEPTIONAL, IT DOES NOT MEAN  THAT PEOPLE FROM OTHER PLACES DON'T FEEL DEEP NATIONAL PRIDE, JUST LIKE WE DO.  IT MEANS THAT WE RECOGNIZE AMERICA'S UNIQUE AND UNPARALLELED ABILITY TO BE A FORCE FOR PEACE AND PROGRESS, A CHAMPION FOR FREEDOM AND  OPPORTUNITY. OUR POWER COMES WITH A RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD HUMBLY, THOUGHTFULLY, AND WITH A FIERCE  COMMITMENT TO OUR VALUES. BECAUSE WHEN AMERICA FAILS TO  LEAD, WE LEAVE A VACUUM THAT EITHER CAUSES CHAOS FOR OTHER COUNTRIES -- OR OTHER COUNTRIES  OR NETWORKS TO FILL THE VOID. NO MATTER HOW HARD IT GETS, NO  MATTER HOW GREAT THE CHALLENGE,  AMERICA MUST LEAD. THE QUESTION IS HOW WE LEAD,  WHAT KIND OF IDEAS, STRATEGIES, AND TACTICS WE BRING TO OUR  LEADERSHIP. AMERICAN LEADERSHIP MEANS STANDING WITH OUR ALLIES BECAUSE OUR NETWORK OF ALLIES IS PART OF WHAT MAKES US EXCEPTIONAL. NO OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS ALLIANCES LIKE OURS. RUSSIA AND CHINA HAVE NOTHING  CLOSE. WE STAND WITH OUR ALLIES BECAUSE GENERATIONS OF AMERICAN TROOPS FOUGHT AND DIED TO SECURE THOSE BONDS AND BECAUSE THEY DELIVER  FOR US EVERYDAY. OUR ALLIES SHARE INTELLIGENCE ON  TERRORISTS. THEY PROVIDE STAGING AREAS FOR OUR MILITARY SO WE CAN RESPOND  QUICKLY TO EVENTS ON THE OTHER  SIDE OF THE WORLD. OTHER NATIONS' SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, AND MARINES  OFTEN FIGHT SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH OURS. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SERVED AND  FOUGHT ALONGSIDE MEN AND WOMEN  FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. YOU SAW THEM IN ACTION. YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THESE BONDS ARE TO OUR SECURITY. THREATENING TO WALK AWAY FROM OUR ALLIANCES, IGNORING THE IMPORTANCE THAT THEY STILL ARE  TO US, IS NOT ONLY WRONG, IT IS DANGEROUS. IF I AM YOUR PRESIDENT, OUR  FRIENDS WILL ALWAYS KNOW, AMERICA WILL HAVE YOUR BACKS, AND WE EXPECT YOU TO HAVE HOURS. AMERICAN LEADERSHIP MEANS  BRINGING THE WORLD TOGETHER TO  SOLVE GLOBAL PROBLEMS AS ONLY WE  CAN. UNITED STATES BUILD OF  INTERNATIONAL COALITION AGAINST  ISIS. NOW WE ARE WORKING WITH PARTNERS TO TAKE BACK TERRITORY AND TO  FEED THEM WITHOUT GETTING DRAWN  INTO A GROUND WAR. WE BROUGHT THE WORLD TOGETHER TO  OPPOSE SANCTIONS ON IRAN AND  SECURE A DEAL THAT PUTS A LID ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM WITHOUT FIRING A SINGLE SHOT. YOU DON'T BUILD A COALITION BY  INSULTING OUR FRIENDS OR ACTING  LIKE A LOOSE CANNON.  YOU DO IT BY PUTTING IN THE SLOW  HARD WORK OF BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS, GETTING COUNTRIES  WORKING TOGETHER WAS MY JOB  EVERY DAY AS YOUR SECRETARY OF  STATE. MORE THAN A PHOTO OP. IT TAKES CONSISTENCY AND RELIABILITY. ACTUALLY, IT IS JUST LIKE  BUILDING PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS. PEOPLE HAVE TO GET TO KNOW THAT  THEY CAN COUNT ON YOU, THAT YOU WON'T SAY ONE THING ONE DAY AND  SENDING TOTALLY DIFFERENT THE NEXT, AND IT CERTAINLY TAKES MORE THAN TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR  A YEAR OF INSULTS AND INSINUATIONS BY DROPPING IN ON  OUR NEIGHBORS FOR A FEW HOURS  AND THEN FLYING HOME AGAIN. THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS. AMERICAN LEADERSHIP MEANS  LEADING WITH OUR VALUES,  PURSUANT OF OUR INTERESTS, AND PROTECTION OF OUR SECURITY.  AT OUR BEST, UNITED STATES IS THE GLOBAL FORCE FOR FREEDOM,  JUSTICE, AND HUMAN DIGNITY. WE CELEBRATE OUR DIVERSITY --   MRS. CLINTON: AS A SOURCE OF NATIONAL STRENGTH. JUST LOOK AT OUR ARMED FORCES,  WHICH REPRESENTS ALL RACES, RELIGIONS, ETHNICITIES, AND YES, IMMIGRANTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, ALL FIGHTING FOR THE RED, WHITE,  AND BLUE. WE STAND UP TO REGIMES THAT  ABUSE HUMAN RIGHTS. WE STAND UP FOR RELIGIOUS AND ETHNIC MINORITIES, FOR WOMEN,  FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AND WE ACT WITH HONOR.  THERE IS NO BETTER PROOF OF THAT THAN WHAT OUR NAVY SEALS DID  DURING THE RAID THAT KILLED  OSAMA BIN LADEN.   I WAS DEEPLY  HONORED TO BE PART OF THAT SMALL  GROUP ADVISING THE PRESIDENT. I BROUGHT TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS MY EXPERIENCE. AS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK ON 9/11 AND MY COMMITMENT TO DO  WHATEVER I COULD IN WHATEVER ROLE I HAD TO BRING BIN LADEN TO  JUSTICE. YOU HAVE ALL SEEN THE PICTURE OF  US CROWDED INTO THE SMALLER SITUATION ROOM WATCHING A VIDEO SCREEN. EVERY SECOND COUNTED.  ONE OF THE COPTERS MS. GAUGED  HOW HOT -- MISGAUGED HOW HIGH  THE WALL WAS AROUND THE  COURTYARD, CLINT THE TALES,  GETTING DISABLED. IT DID NOT STOP THE SEALS FROM RUSHING OUT, GETTING INTO THE COMPOUND, RETURNING FIRE AGAINST BIN LADEN'S BODYGUARDS, TAKING  ON HIS ADULT SON, AND FINALLY  BIN LADEN HIMSELF.  BUT THE SEALS KNEW THAT THEY HAD  TO DESTROY THE HELICOPTER BEFORE THEY LEFT. I WAS HOLDING MY BREATH THROUGH  THE ENTIRE OPERATION.  BECAUSE AT ANY TIME, PAKISTANI  SOLDIERS COULD HAVE ARRIVED. THIS COMPOUND WAS IN A MILITARY GARRISON CITY, ACTUALLY THE HOME  OF THEIR MILITARY ACADEMY. SO YES, EVERY SECOND COUNTED. BUT STILL, OUR SEALS TOOK THE TIME TO MOVE THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN, BIN LADEN'S FAMILY MEMBERS, TO SAFETY BEFORE  DESTROYING THE HELICOPTER.  THAT IS WHAT HONOR LOOKS LIKE.  THAT IS AMERICA AT OUR BEST.   MAYBE THE SOLDIERS  OF OTHER NATIONS WOULD NOT HAVE BOTHERED OR MAYBE THEY WOULD H AVE TAKEN REVENGE ON THOSE  FAMILY MEMBERS OF TERRORISTS. BUT THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. AND ANYONE WHO DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THAT DOES NOT  UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES OUR NATION GREAT. AND LET ME SAY SOMETHING ELSE  ABOUT AMERICAN GREATNESS --  THERE IS NO QUESTION, WE FACE REAL THREATS AND REAL ENEMIES  THAT WE NEED TO CONFRONT AND DEFEAT. BUT MY OPPONENT IS WRONG WHEN HE  SAYS AMERICA IS NO LONGER GREAT. CONSIDER THE RECORD OF THE PAST  EIGHT YEARS. IN 2009, OUR GLOBAL ECONOMY WAS COLLAPSING. OSAMA BIN LADEN WAS FRONTING. WE HAD MORE THAN 180,000 TROOPS FIGHTING TWO WARS. IRAN WAS RACING TOWARD A NUCLEAR WEAPON. MANY OF OUR ALLIES WERE LESS SUPPORTIVE OF AMERICAN  LEADERSHIP THAN THEY HAD BEEN IN  DECADES. LOOK WHERE WE ARE NOW. WE HAVE PULLED THE GLOBAL ECONOMY OUT OF FREEFALL THANKS TO THE HARD WORK AND SACRIFICE  OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE HAVE REDEPLOYED WELL OVER  100,000 TROOPS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN SO THEY CAN GO HOME,  REST, AND TRAIN FOR FUTURE  CONTINGENCIES. WE CUT OFF IRAN'S PATH TO A  NUCLEAR WEAPON. WE CONVINCED RUSSIA TO REDUCE  THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARSENAL. WE PROTECTED OUR ALLY ISRAEL,  AND WE BROUGHT OSAMA BIN LADEN  TO JUSTICE. WE DID THAT, WE AMERICANS DID  ALL OF THAT, WORKING TOGETHER ACROSS PARTY LINES. AND THERE IS NO QUESTION WE HAVE  MORE WORK TO DO, BUT LET'S BE CLEAR -- WE ARE STRONGER  TOGETHER, AND IT WILL BE MY GOAL, IF I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT, TO BRING PEOPLE BACK TOGETHER AGAIN, TO SET OUR GOALS AND MOVE FORWARD  TO ACHIEVE THEM.   I KNOW THAT WE  CANNOT CLOSE YET TO DICTATORS. WE HAVE TO STAND UP TO THEM HERE  AT WE CANNOT CONTAIN ISIS.  WE MUST DEFEAT THEM, AND WE WILL . WE WILL DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES TO BRING  THEM TO JUSTICE AND END THEIR R EIGN OF TERROR ONCE AND FOR ALL. THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT HOW TO  MAKE THINGS BETTER. MAKE NO MISTAKE, I BELIEVE WE  DO HAVE BETTER DAYS AHEAD. BUT THINGS COULD ALSO GET WORSE. IF MORE COUNTRIES GET NUCLEAR  WEAPONS, IF WE ABANDON OUR  ALLIES, IF OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF ORDERS OUR  MILITARY TO BREAK THE LAWS AND  COMMIT TORTURE OR MURDER TERRORISTS' FAMILY MEMBERS. THAT IS WHY IT IS SO CRITICAL WE  GET THIS RIGHT.  AND LET ME UNDERSCORE WHAT I  HAVE SAID THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN -- WE MUST ONLY SEND  OUR TROOPS INTO HARM'S WAY AS A LAST RESORT, NOT A FIRST CHOICE.  THAT MUST BE OUR BEDROCK  PRINCIPLE.   BUT WE MUST BE  ABLE TO ACT DECISIVELY ON OUR  OWN WHEN WE NEED TO. I COMPLETELY REJECT ANYONE,  INCLUDING MY OPPONENT, WHO CALLS  THE AMERICAN MILITARY, AND I  QUOTE, "" A DISASTER."" THAT IS AN INSULT TO THE MEN AND WOMEN SERVING TODAY AND ALL WHO  HAVE SERVED BEFORE AND PUT THEIR  LIVES ON THE LINE.  IT IS JUST NOT TRUE. WE DO HAVE MORE WORK TO DO TO  CONTINUE TO HAVE THE STRONGEST,  MOST EFFECTIVE MILITARY IN THE  WORLD. I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT  MATTERS A GREAT DEAL TO EVERYONE  IN THIS ROOM. AND HERE IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.  WE CANNOT LOSE OUR MILITARY  EDGE. THAT MEANS GIVING THE PENTAGON  THE STABLE, PREDICTABLE FUNDING  IT NEEDS TO MAKE SMART  INVESTMENTS. YOU HAVE HEARD --    YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE SEQUESTER, THE ARBITRARY CAPS CONGRESS HAS IMPOSED ON OUR  ENTIRE GOVERNMENT FOR THE PAST  SEVERAL YEARS.  LOOK, I AM ALL FOR CUTTING THE  FAT OUT OF THE BUDGET AND MAKING  SURE WE STRETCH OUR DOLLARS. I AM PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WHEN MY HUSBAND LEFT OFFICE, WE HAD A BALANCED BUDGET AND A SURPLUS, AND I HOPE THAT SOMEDAY WE CAN GET BACK TO DOING THAT.  BUT WE CANNOT IMPOSE ARBITRARY LIMITS ON SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS OUR MILITARY. THAT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL. SEQUESTER MAKES OUR COUNTRY LESS  SECURE. LET'S END IT AND GET A BUDGET  DEAL THAT SUPPORTS AMERICA'S MILITARY, OUR FAMILIES, AND OUR COUNTRY.  AND LET'S MAKE REFORM A PRIORITY  SO THAT THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT  SPENDS ITS BUDGET ON THE RIGHT  THINGS.  AND BY THE WAY, THE LAST THING  WE NEED IS A PRESIDENT WHO BRINGS MORE NAME-CALLING AND  TEMPER TANTRUMS TO WASHINGTON. GETTING BOTH PARTIES ACTUALLY TO WORK TOGETHER. LET'S MODERNIZE OUR ARMY, MARINES, NAVY, AIR FORCE, COAST  GUARD.  WE NEED TO RESPOND TO EVOLVING THREATS FROM STATES LIKE RUSSIA, CHINA, IRAN, AND NORTH KOREA. FROM NETWORKS, CRIMINAL AND  TERRORIST NETWORKS LIKE ISIS. WE NEED A MILITARY THAT IS READY  AND AGILE TO MEET THE FULL RANGE  OF THREATS AND OPERATE ON SHORT  NOTICE ACROSS EVERY DOMAIN, NOT JUST LAND, SEA, AIR AND SPACE,  BUT ALSO CYBERSPACE AREA WE WILL  INVEST IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES, NEW BREAKTHROUGHS THAT WILL  TRANSFORM OUR MILITARY. JUST AS STEALTHY, PRECISION  WEAPONS AND ADVANCED MEDICATIONS LIKE THEY DID IN THE PAST. WE WILL MAKE A RENEWED PUSH TO  REDUCE NUCLEAR WEAPONS BECAUSE  THAT DOES MAKE US ALL SAFER, AND  WE WILL STEP UP EFFORTS TO SECURE NUCLEAR MATERIAL AROUND  THE WORLD AND STOP TERRORISTS  FROM ACQUIRING OR USING WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.  ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I WILL  DO AS PRESIDENT IS TO CALL FOR A  NEW NUCLEAR POSTURE WITH YOU --  REVIEW. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT AMERICAN ARSENAL IS PREPARED TO MEET FUTURE THREATS. WE WILL INVEST IN THE NEXT  FRONTIER OF MILITARY ENGAGEMENT, PROTECTING U.S. INTEREST IN  OUTER SPACE AND CYBERSPACE. YOU HAVE SEEN REPORTS, RUSSIA HAS HACKED INTO A LOT OF THINGS, RUSSIA EVEN HACKED INTO THE  DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE. MAYBE EVEN SOME STATE ELECTIONS SYSTEMS, SO WE HAVE TO STEP UP  OUR GAME, MAKE SURE WE ARE WELL  DEFENDED AND ABLE TO TAKE THE  FIGHT TO THOSE TO GO BACK OR US. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE UNITED STATES  WILL TREAT CYBER ATTACKS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER ATTACKS CARRIED  WE WILL BE READY WITH SERIOUS POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND MILITARY RESPONSES, AND WE ARE  GOING TO INVEST IN PROTECTING  OUR GOVERNMENTAL NETWORK AND OUR NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE. I WANT US TO LEAVE THE WORLD IN  SETTING THE RULES OF CYBERSPACE. IF AMERICA DOES NOT, OTHERS  WILL. IN SHORT, WE HAVE TO BE READY TO  WIN TODAY'S FIGHTS AND  TOMORROW'S. BUT YOU KNOW THAT THE MOST  IMPORTANT THING IS NOT THE SIZE  OF OUR MILITARY OR THE  SOPHISTICATION OF OUR WEAPONS,  THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS OUR  PEOPLE, THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO  PUT ON THE UNIFORM AND SERVE.  WE NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT OUR MILITARY PERSONNEL POLICY TO  MAKE SURE WE ARE DOING  EVERYTHING TO ATTRACT AND KEEP  THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST TO VOLUNTEER.  WE NEED TO SUPPORT NOT ONLY THEM BUT ALSO THEIR FAMILIES. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL NEVER FORGET THE DEBT WHEEL TO OUR VETERANS -- WE GO TO OUR VETERANS AND YOUR FAMILIES, WHO  ALSO SERVED. I WILL NEVER, EVER DISRESPECT  GOLD STAR FAMILY'S COUP HAVE  MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE FOR  OUR NATION.   OR PRISONERS OF WAR WHO ENDURED SO MUCH IN OUR NAME.  TO INSULT THEM IS JUST SO WRONG. AND IT SAYS A LOT ABOUT THE PERSON DOING THE INSULTING. IN THE SENATE, I WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS TO INCREASE THE  BENEFIT PAID TO GOLD STAR  FAMILY'S, TO EXPAND ACCESS TO  MILITARY HEALTH INSURANCE, TO  MAKE SURE ALL MEMBERS OF THE  GUARD AND RESERVE AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH BENEFITS WHETHER THEY ARE  DEPLOYED OR TRAINING AT HOME.  I FOUGHT SUCCESSFULLY TO AMEND THE 2007 DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, TO ESTABLISH A TRAINING PROGRAM FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS HELPING LOVED ONES WITH  TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES. SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN AND I JOINED  FORCES TO PERSONALLY RAISE MONEY FOR STATE OF THE ART REHAB FACILITY IN SAN ANTONIO. TO HELP SERIOUSLY WOUNDED SERVICEMEMBERS COMING HOME FROM IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN. LIKE YOU, I WAS OUTRAGED BY THE SCANDAL AT THE BA HOSPITALS, P -- V.A. HOSPITALS, PEOPLE WAITING FOR MONTHS FOR BASIC MEDICATIONS, WHEELCHAIRS, AND SOME DIED WHILE WAITING FOR AN APPOINTMENT.  I KNOW YOU HEARD FROM SECRETARY MCDONALD AND I KNOW HOW HARD HE  AND HIS TEAM ARE WORKING. WE ARE TO BUILD A 21ST CENTURY  DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS THAT DELIVERS WORLD-CLASS CARE,  AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE PRIVATIZE THE V.A.   WE ARE GOING TO REFORM AND STRENGTHEN IT, NOT PRIVATIZE IT.  WE WILL ENSURE ACCESS TO ASK -- TO TIMELY QUALITY CARE TO ALL  VETERANS, IMPROVE CARE FOR WOMEN  WHO WERE OFTEN UNDERSERVED, IDENTIFY AND TREAT ALL WOUNDS OF WAR, VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE, INCLUDING AGE AND ORIGIN, GULF  WAR SYNDROME, AND TRAUMATIC  BRAIN INJURY AND PTSD.  WE WILL END EPIDEMIC OF VETERAN SUICIDES BY EXPANDING ACCESS TO  MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND FIGHTING THE STIGMA THAT ISOLATES TOO  MANY OF OUR VETERANS FROM  GETTING THE CARE THAT THEY NEED.  I FEEL PASSIONATELY ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I HAVE LOOKED INTO THE EYES OF TOO MANY FAMILY MEMBERS  WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LOVED ONES TO SUICIDE. THAT IS WHY JUST TWO DAYS AGO, WHEN I RELEASED MY PLAN TO  IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES  FOR ALL AMERICANS, I INCLUDED A  SPECIFIC SECTION ABOUT MORE HELP FOR VETERANS ON THE FAMILIES BECAUSE WE KNOW TOO  MANY ARE NOT GETTING THE HELP  THEY NEED RIGHT NOW. BE HAVE GOT TO SERVE THEM JUST AS THEY HAD SERVED US. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO HELP MORE  VETERANS LOOKING FOR JOBS WITH EXPANDED TAX CREDITS, FOR  BUSINESSES THAT HIRE VETERANS. MORE SUPPORT TO VETERANS WHO WANT TO START THEIR OWN BUSINESSES AND MAKING IT EASIER  FOR VETERANS TO GET CREDIT FOR  THIS GOES THEY LEARNED WHILE  SERVING.  AND WE WILL CRACK DOWN ON SCHOOLS AND COMPANIES THAT  DISSEMINATE AGAINST SERVICE  MEMBERS, VETERANS OR MILITARY  FAMILIES.  THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF  THEMSELVES. WE ARE GOING TO WILL THEM  ACCOUNTABLE.  WE WILL ALSO WORK CLOSELY WITH  THE AMERICAN LEGION THE CLEANUP AND EXPEDITE THE APPEALS PROCESS . BENEFITS SHOULD BE DELIVERED AS  QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND APPEALS  SHOULD BE DECIDED AS  EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE. I THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU ARE  DOING ON THAT.  A LOT OF WHAT I HAVE MENTIONED  HAS SUPPORT FROM DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.  MAINTAINING OUR MILITARY AND  CARING FOR VETERANS SHOULD NEVER  BE A PARTISAN ISSUE. DEFENDING AMERICAN  EXCEPTIONALISM SHOULD ALWAYS BE  ABOVE POLITICS. BUT THIS IS NOT A NORMAL  ELECTION. THE DEBATE ARE NOT THE NORMAL  DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, SO I  HOPE YOU WILL LISTEN CAREFULLY  TO WHAT MY OPPONENT I PROPOSE.  CONSIDER OUR PLANS IN THE VALUES  BEHIND THEM AND AFTER YOU HAVE  GIVEN US BOTH A FAIR HEARING, I  HOPE YOU WILL JOIN THE GROWING  NUMBER OF AMERICANS, DEMOCRATS,  REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS WHO  ARE SUPPORTING OUR VISION FOR  THE KIND OF FUTURE THAT WE WANT  FOR OUR COUNTRY.  THE SELECTION SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT IDEOLOGY.  IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT DIFFERENCES OVER POLICIES.  IT TRULY IS ABOUT WHO HAS THE EXPERIENCE AND THE TEMPERAMENT TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. JUST THREE WEEKS AGO, 50  REPUBLICAN NATIONAL SECURITY  EXPERTS, WHO SERVED IN PRIOR REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS,  WROTE A LETTER, SAYING THEY WILL  NOT VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP  BECAUSE HE WOULD BE IN THEIR WORDS -- THE MOST RECKLESS PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. BY CONTRAST, I AM DEEPLY HONORED  TO HAVE SO MANY RETIRED  MILITARY LEADERS BACKING ME, ALONG WITH THESE REPUBLICAN EXPERTS. I AM SUPPORTED BY PEOPLE ON BOTH  SIDES OF THE AISLE.  AND BOTH SIDES OF THE DEBATES  THAT HAVE DEFINED THEIR  FOREIGN-POLICY FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS, THEY KNOW I BELIEVE IN  THE BIPARTISAN FOREIGN-POLICY. THEY KNOW I SHOULD BELIEVE IN FINDING WAYS TO BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER AROUND NATIONAL SECURITY, OUR ROLE IN THE WORLD, OUR VALUES.  THEY KNOW THEY CAN COUNT ON ME  TO DO THAT. AND WHAT MATTERS TO THEM IS THAT  WE MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE IN NOVEMBER.  THE STAKES THIS FALL RSIS AND THE IN OUR ELECTION, SO I KEEP  RAISING THESE ISSUES, KEEP  TELLING PEOPLE WHERE I STAND, LAYING OUT PLANS FOR WHAT I DO  IF I'M ELECTED.  PACK HAVE TO TELL YOU IT IS A LITTLE FUNNY TO GET CRITICIZED SO MANY PLANS. PEOPLE SAY, THERE SHE GOES ABOUT ANOTHER PLAN ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND VETERANS.  I HAVE AN OLD-FASHIONED IDEA  THAT IF I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE FOR  PRESIDENT, I SHOULD TELL YOU  WHAT I WILL DO AS YOUR  PRESIDENT, SO, YES, I HAVE LAID  OUT PLANS AND I WILL WORK HARD OUT TO IMPLEMENT THE PLANS. -- I WILL WORK MY HEART OUT TO  IMPLEMENT THE PLANS. I KNOW NO ONE WILL WORK HARDER  THAN OUR TROOPS, VETERANS AND  MILITARY FAMILIES. THIS IS PERSONAL TO ME, STARTING WITH MY DAD.  HIS NAME WAS HUGH BROUGHT HIM R -- RODHAM.  HE BECAME A CHIEF PETTY OFFICER  AT GREAT LAKES, NORTH OF CHICAGO . RESPONSIBLE FOR TRAINING  THOUSANDS OF YOUNG SAILORS BEFORE THEY SHIPPED OUT TO SEI AS, MOSTLY TO THE PACIFIC THE  BEER. AFTER MY DAD DIED, I RECEIVED LETTERS FROM MEN WHO HAD SERVED UNDER HIM AND I TREASURE THEM TO THIS DAY.  MY FATHER TOLD ME HOW EMOTIONAL HE GOT WHEN HE ACCOMPANIED HIS  TRAINEES TO THE WEST COAST AND  SAW THOSE YOUNG SAILORS GET ON  BOARD THEIR SHIPS. HE KNEW SOME OF THEM ARE NOT  SURVIVE. BUT HE BELIEVED IN THEIR CAUSE, HE BELIEVED IN THEM, AND THEY WENT TO SERVE TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY. THEY KNEW THE COUNTRY NEEDED THEM.  OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEARS, I HAVE ALSO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH,  HELPING AND SUPPORTING SO MANY  ACTIVE-DUTY AND RETIRED MILITARY , MEMBERS AND FAMILY, FIRST, AS  FIRST LADY, THEN AS SENATOR,  THEN AS SECRETARY OF STATE. WHENEVER I WOULD GO ANYWHERE REPRESENTING YOU AND BE  PRIVILEGED TO MEET WITH THE MEN  AND WOMEN WHO SERVE OUR COUNTRY,  I WOULD SIT DOWN IF WE HAD A  CHANCE AND HEAR WHAT WAS ON THEIR MIND, SHAKE HANDS, TAKE PICTURES, SOMETIMES BRING  MESSAGES BACK TO THEIR LOVED ONES. I, TOO, KNEW THAT SOME OF THOSE  YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WOULD NOT BE  COMING HOME EITHER. IT IS THAT KIND OF COURAGE AND HONOR THAT OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM DEMONSTRATE EVERY SINGLE  DAY.  I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT. AND I WOULD EXPECT THE AMERICAN LEGION TO BE MY PARTNER IN THE  WHITE HOUSE TO MAKE SURE I NEVER  DO. YOU AND ALL OUR VETERANS DESERVE  NOTHING LESS, I RESPECT, I THANKS, BUT YOU ALSO DESERVE A  COUNTRY THAT HONORS YOUR  SERVICE, NOT JUST WITH WORDS BUT WITH DEEDS. THAT IS WHY THE AMERICAN LEGION IS SO CRITICAL, WORKING EVERY  DAY TO MAKE SURE AMERICA LIVES  UP TO THAT STANDARD. I WILL BE DOING THAT WORK RIGHT ALONGSIDE YOU IF I AM GIVEN THE GREAT HONOR TO SERVE AS YOUR PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF . THANK YOU, ALL. GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS THE  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  YOU ARE. -- THANK YOU.    IT LOOKS YOU  DEFAULT.  DO YOU WANT TO SHOW IT?                         >>",Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton American Legion Speech

WOW. HELLO, EVERYONE.   AND YOUR  CONGRESSMAN, MATT CARTWRIGHT. AND YOUR AMAZING RECORDER OF DEEDS, EVAN MCNULTY. WE SURE MISS THAT HAS BEEN OF  YOURS. WE ARE THINKING ABOUT YOU, AND  WE ARE SENDING YOU OUR BEST  WISHES. OF COURSE, AS I SAID, I AM HERE  WITH THE ONE AND ONLY VICE  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.     YOU KNOW, JOE GREW  UP ON NORTH WASHINGTON AVENUE. NO MATTER HOW FAR HE TRAVELED,  HE NEVER FORGETS WHERE HE IS  FROM. I HAD SEEN HIM IN A LOT OF SETTINGS, IN THE SPOTLIGHT AS  VICE PRESIDENT AND SENATOR, IN A QUIET MOVEMENTS -- MOMENTS WITH CONSTITUENTS IN -- CONSTITUENTS,  AND IN THE SITUATION ROOM LPINTO MAKE DECISIONS THAT AFFECT OUR LIVES AND SECURITY. WHEREVER HE GOES, HE IS ALWAYS  THE SAME GUY. HE IS A FIGHTER FOR ANYONE THAT  NEEDS A CHAMPION.  HE IS A FIGHTER FOR THE TOWN OF  SCRANTON. AND HE IS A FIGHTER FOR  FAMILIES.    YOU KNOW, I THINK HE WOULD BE THE FIRST TO SAY  THAT HE CARES ABOUT YOUR FAMILY  BECAUSE OF HIS FAMILY. JOE SENIOR ANNE CATHERINE TODD -- AND CATHERINE TAUGHT JOE THAT  ALL PEOPLE DESERVE TO BE TREATED  WITH DIGNITY. YOU SEE SOMEONE FALL, YOU HELP  THEM UP. WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.  THAT IS THE BIDEN WAY. WE HAVE SEEN HOW HE FIGHTS FOR WORKING FAMILIES, BECAUSE HE PASSIONATELY BELIEVES IN THE A SICK BARGAINS THAT MAKE OUR AMERICA GREAT. THAT OUR ECONOMY SHOULD WORK FOR  EVERYONE AND NOT JUST THOSE AT  THE TOP. HE STANDS UP AGAINST INJUSTICE.  HE HAS LED THE FIGHT TO END VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS. AND HE STARES -- STANDS UP FOR PEOPLE'S HEALTH INCLUDING THE  PROJECT HE IS NOW LEADING ON  BEHALF OF PRESIDENT OBAMA. THE CANCER MOONSHOT TO HELP SAVE  LIVES. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, HIS WONDERFUL SON, A GREAT FATHER  AND GREAT PUBLIC SERVANT, A  GREAT HUMAN BEING, PASSED AWAY  LAST YEAR. THIS IS PERSONAL TO JOE BIDEN. HE KNOWS IT IS PERSONAL TO A LOT  OF FAMILIES. THAT IS WHY HE IS FIGHTING SO  HARD TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IF I AM ELECTED THIS FALL I WILL ASK HIM TO CONTINUE THE  IMPORTANT WORK HE HAS DONE TO  HELP US FIGHT AND DEFEAT CANCER.    AS SOMEONE WHO HAS  WORKED WITH JOE FOR YEARS, FIRST  IN THE SENATE AND THEN AS A  MEMBER OF THE OBAMA-BIDEN, I CAN  SAY THAT THAT DRIVE TO MAKE LIFE  BETTER IS WHAT PUSHES HIM TO  MAKE LIFE BETTER EVERY SECOND OF  EVERY DAY FOR ALL OF US. JOE AND HIS WONDERFUL WIFE,  JILL, HAVE RAISED THEIR CHILDREN  AND GRANDCHILDREN WITH THOSE  SAME VALUES.  JOE, I HOPE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH  NOT JUST SCRANTON ALSO AMERICA  LOVES YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.    IT MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO HAVE HIM BY MY SIDE. WHEN JOE AND I WERE DECIDING  WHERE TO HAVE OUR FIRST CAMPAIGN  RALLY, THERE WAS REALLY ONLY ONE  ANSWER. SCRANTON IS NOT JUST JOE'S  HOMETOWN, IT IS ALSO MY DADS  HOMETOWN. WHILE THE BIDEN'S WERE ON NORTH WASHINGTON AVENUE, MY FAMILY WAS  A FEW BLOCKS AWAY ON DIED IN -- DIAMOND AVENUE. MY GRANDFATHER WENT TO WORK AT THE SCRANTON LAKE MILL STARTING  AS A TEENAGER.  IT WAS NOT EASY WORK. I LEARNED THAT THAT BUSINESS  TREATED ITS WORKERS RIGHT. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THE SCRANTON LACE COMPANY, ALL THOSE YEARS AGO, ACTUALLY OFFERED A PROFIT SHARING PLAN AND HEALTH BENEFITS  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH  CENTURY. THEY UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING THAT A  LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE FORGOTTEN.   THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT THEIR WORKERS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH OF THE BUSINESS'S SUCCESS, AND THAT THEIR FAMILIES BENEFITED TO. BECAUSE OF THAT JOB, MY  GRANDFATHER COULD GIVE MY FATHER  A BETTER LIFE.  MY FATHER WAS ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE. HE WENT TO PENN STATE, WHERE HE  PLAYED FOOTBALL.   THEN, AFTER HE GOT  OUT OF PENN STATE, IT WAS 1935. RIGHT IN THE DEPTHS OF THE DEPRESSION.  HE WAS LOOKING FOR A JOB, AND HE HEARD THAT A FRIEND OF HIS NEW SOMEONE -- KNEW SOMEONE THAT  HEARD SOMEONE SAY THAT HEARD SOMEONE SAY THERE WAS A JOB. HE BECAME A SALESMAN. HE WENT INTO THE NAVY FOR WORLD  WAR II. WHEN HE GOT OUT, HE STARTED A  SMALL BUSINESS IN CHICAGO, WHERE  I GREW UP.  JUST LIKE HIS DAD BEFORE HIM, MY  DAD WAS DETERMINED TO GIVE US  BETTER OPPORTUNITIES THAT EVEN  HE HAD. THAT IS THE AMERICAN DREAM. WHEREVER LIFE TAKES ME, I REMEMBER I AM THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FACTORY WORKER AND A  DAUGHTER OF A SMALL BUSINESS  OWNER. I AM SO PROUD OF IT.   THE STORY OF THE BOTTOMS -- RODHAMS AND THE BIDENS IS NOT COMPLETELY UNIQUE. NO MATTER WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS, AMERICA IS GREAT. THE AMERICAN DREAM IS TAKEN OFF FOR EVERYONE TO SHARE IN ITS PROMISE. THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE CAN TAKE  IT FOR GRANTED AND JUST WAIT FOR  IT TO HAPPEN TO US.  WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. HERE IN SCRANTON, YOU KNOW THAT. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN HAVE WORKED TO  PUT OUR ECONOMY BACK ON A STRONGER FOOTING AFTER THE  RECESSION. I PERSONALLY DO NOT THINK THEY  GET ENOUGH CREDIT FOR THAT. UNDER THEIR LEADERSHIP, WE HAVE CREATED 15 -- 15 MILLION NEW PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS.  20 MILLION PEOPLE NOW HAVE  HEALTH CARE. THE AUTO INDUSTRY JUST HAD ITS  BEST YEAR EVER.   SO, I BELIEVE THE  JOB OF THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS TO  BUILD ON THAT, AND TO TAKE ON  THE DEEPER CHALLENGES THAT  EMERGED LONG BEFORE THE CRISIS  AND HAVE PERSISTED DURING OUR RECOVERY. WAGES ARE TOO LOW.  IT IS STILL TOO HARD FOR TOO  MANY TO GET AHEAD. MY TOP PRIORITY IS CREATING AN  ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE.  NOT JUST FOR THOSE AT THE TOP. I HAVE SET FIVE AND DISHES GOALS  TO GET US THERE.  FIRST, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THE  BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN JOBS SINCE  WORLD WAR II. SECOND, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE COLLEGE DEBT-FREE FOR ALL.  WE ARE GOING TO HELP MILLIONS OF  PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR  DEBT PAYMENTS. THIRD, WE ARE GOING TO CRACK  DOWN ON COMPANIES THAT SHIFT  JOBS AND PROFITS OVERSEAS. WE ARE GOING TO REWARD COMPANIES  THAT SHARE PROFITS WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES, LIKE THE SCRANTON LACE COMPANY DID MOST A CENTURY AGO. FOURTH --   THANK YOU. FOURTH, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE  SURE THAT WALL STREET IN THE  SUPERRICH PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES. FIFTH, WE ARE GOING TO RESPOND  TO THE WAY THAT AMERICAN FAMILIES LIVED AND WORKED TO DATE BY MAKING CHILDCARE  AFFORDABLE. IN TODAY'S ECONOMY, THERE IS  OFTEN NO PARENT OR GRANDPARENT  THAT CAN STAY HOME WITH THE  CHILD. WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE. SOMETIMES, YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE  OF YOUR CHILD OR SPOUSE OR SICK  PARENT.  YOU SHOULD NOT LOSE YOUR JOB FOR  TAKING CARE OF THEM.   WHENEVER I MENTION  THESE ISSUES, DONALD TRUMP ALWAYS SAYS THAT I AM PLAYING  THE WOMAN CARD.  YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY, IF I AM PLAYING THE WOMAN CARD THEN DELIAN -- DEAL ME IN. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT TOGETHER THIS PLAN WILL GO A FAR WAY IN BUILDING A STRONGER, MORE FAIR  ECONOMY. EVERYONE CAN SHARE AND ITS  REWARDS.  BY CONTRAST, WHAT IS DONALD TRUMP'S PLAN? HE LAID IT OUT LAST WEEK. EVEN BEFORE HE DID, I DID NOT  THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR  WORKING AMERICANS. IT TURNED OUT TO BE WORSE THAN I  EVER IMAGINED. I KNOW SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE FRIENDS IN NORTHEASTERN  PENNSYLVANIA THAT ARE WORKING --  INKING ABOUT VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP -- THINKING ABOUT VOTING  FOR DONALD TRUMP. I KNOW, FRIENDS SHOULD NOT LET  FRIENDS VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.    JUST IN CASE, IF  YOU HAVE A CONVERSATION, YOU  SHOULD EXPLAIN THAT DONALD TRUMP  WOULD GIVE TRILLIONS OF TAX CUTS TO MAJOR COMPANIES AND WALL STREET MONEY MANAGERS. THAT WOULD LEAD TO MASSIVE CUTS  IN THINGS LIKE EDUCATION AND  HEALTH CARE. HE IS ALSO CALLED FOR A NEW TAX LOOPHOLE.  LET'S CALL IT THE ""TRUMP LOOPHOLE."" IT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO PLAY --  PAY LESS THAN HALF OF THE CURRENT INCOME TAX RATE ON HIS  COMPANIES. IT IS ASSUMING HE PAYS ANY TAXES  AT ALL, BECAUSE WE DO NOT KNOW. WE HAVE NOT SEEN HIS TAX  RETURNS.   WE DO KNOW BY  LOOKING AT THE DATA THAT THE 400 RICHEST TAXPAYERS IN AMERICA  WOULD GET AN AVERAGE TAX CUT OF MORE THAN $15 MILLION A YEAR  FROM THE DONALD TRUMP LOOPHOLE. THEN, THERE IS THE ESTATE TAX  THAT DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO  ELIMINATE ALTOGETHER. IF YOU BELIEVE HE IS AS WEALTHY  AS HE CLAIMS, THAT WOULD SAVE  THE TRUMP FAMILY $4 BILLION. IT WOULD DO NOTHING FOR 99.8% OF ALL THE OTHER AMERICANS IN OUR  COUNTRY. SO YES, $4 BILLION IN TAX CUTS  FOR DONALD TRUMP AND 99.8% OF  AMERICANS GET NOTHING. THINK OF WHAT WE COULD DO WITH THOSE $4 BILLION. WE COULD PAY FOR MORE THAN  47,000 THAT ARE IN'S TO GET A  FOUR-YEAR -- VETERANS TO GET A  FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE DEGREE. WE COULD PROVIDE A YEARS WORTH  OF HEALTH CARE TO NEARLY 3  MILLION KIDS. WE COULD FIND A YEARS WORTH OF  FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO STATE AND  LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT'S -- ENFORCEMENT. THERE IS A LOT OF WAY TO SPEND THAT MONEY. THERE IS ONE OTHER PART OF HIS PLAN.  HE NOW SAYS HE WANTS PEOPLE TO  HELP A FOR CHILDCARE BY EXCLUDING THOSE PAYMENTS FROM  TAXATION. AGAIN, GUESS WHO WILL THAT WILL HELP THE MOST? IT WILL HELP RICH PEOPLE. HARD-WORKING FAMILIES THAT  CANNOT AFFORD CHILDCARE IN THE  FIRST PLACE WILL GET LITTLE TO  NO REAL HELP. THAT IS WHY HIS CHILDCARE PLAN HAS BEEN HAD BY EXPERTS ACROSS  THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. RIGHT NOW, CHILDCARE COSTS AS  MUCH AS IN-STATE COLLEGE TUITION IN MOST OF THE COUNTRY.  WE NEED REAL SOLUTIONS THAT ARE  GOING TO WORK FOR WORKING PEOPLE.  NOT JUST FOR THE WELL OFF. TO PROVE THAT HE CARES ABOUT THE  ISSUE, HE MADE A POINT OF  TALKING ABOUT HOW HIS BUSINESSES OFFER ON-SITE CHILDCARE FOR  WORKERS.  THAT KIND OF PERK ME UP. IF HE REALLY DID THAT, IT WOULD  BE A BIG DEAL.  I WISH MORE COMPANIES PROVIDED ON-SITE CHILDCARE. IT WOULD BE A HUGE BENEFIT FOR  EMPLOYEES. LIKE SO MUCH OF WHAT HE SAYS, IT  IS NOT TRUE.  IT TURNS OUT, SOME OF HIS RESORT  HOTELS AND CLUBS OFFER CHILDCARE SERVICES FOR GUESTS NOT NOT --  NOT FOR EMPLOYEES. JUST SAYING. IF YOU STAY AT A DONALD TRUMP HOTEL, YOU CAN ENROLL YOUR CHILD  IN SOMETHING CALLED ""TRUMP KIDS."" THEY GET SPECIAL CHILDREN'S ROOM  SERVICE AND SPA SERVICES. THE EVEN GET A NANNY FOR A FEE. IF YOU WORK FOR HIS BUSINESS, IF YOU CLEAN THE ROOMS, WATER THE LINES, YOU GET NOTHING.   I AM NOT EVEN SURE THAT DONALD TRUMP KNOWS THAT PROVIDING A TRUMP KIDS PROGRAM  IS NOT THE SAME THING AS PROVIDING REAL CHILDCARE FOR  YOUR WORKERS. JUST LIKE HOW HIS TAX BREAKS FOR MILLIONAIRES ARE NOT THE SAME  THING AS A PLAN TO HELP THE  AMERICAN WORKING FAMILIES. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS A  SAYING I LOVE. DO NOT SHOW ME YOUR VALUES, TELL ME YOUR BUDGET. THEN, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU VALUE.   IT IS PRETTY CLEAR  THAT DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO GIVE  ALIENS OF TAX BREAKS TO HIS BEST  FRIENDS. NOT TO ANYONE THAT REALLY PROVIDE SERVICES. WE FACE SOME SERIOUS CHALLENGES IN AMERICA.  WE NEED SERIOUS LEADERSHIP. THIS IS NOT A REALITY TV SHOW. THIS IS AS REAL AS IT GETS. LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN  MILWAUKEE RIGHT NOW.  WE HAVE URGENT WORK TO DO TO  REBUILD TRUST BETWEEN POLICE AND  THE COMMUNITIES.  EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE RESPECT FOR  THE LAW, AND EVERYONE SHOULD BE  RESPECTED BY THE LAW.   SO WHEN ALL THESE  IMPORTANT CHALLENGES, YOU HAVE  TO ASK IF DONALD TRUMP IS UP FOR  THE JOB? HE IS GIVING A SPEECH ABOUT ISIS  TODAY. I HAVE LAID OUT MY STRATEGY FOR DEFEATING ISIS OVER MANY MONTHS. WE WILL STRIKE THEIR SANCTUARIES  FROM THE AIR, AND WE WILL SUPPORT LOCAL FORCES TAKING THEM  OUT ON THE GROUND. UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, WE ARE MAKING  PROGRESS. WE WILL DISRUPT THEIR EFFORTS ONLINE TO REACH AND RADICALIZED YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY. IT WILL NOT EAT EASY OR QUICK. MAKE NO MISTAKE.  WE WILL PREVAIL. THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.    ONCE AGAIN, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE ON ISIS. HE SPOKE ABOUT SYRIA BECOMING A  FREE ZONE FOR ISIS. A MAJOR COMPANY IN THE MIDDLE EAST THAT COULD LAUNCH ATTACKS AGAINST US AND OTHERS. HE IS TALKING ABOUT SENDING AMERICAN GROUND TROOPS, WELL  THAT IS OFF THE TABLE AS FAR AS  I AM CONCERNED.   WE WILL WAIT AND  SEE WHAT HE SAYS TODAY. SOMETIMES HE SAYS HE WILL NOT  TELL ANYONE WHAT HE WILL DO, BECAUSE HE WAS TO KEEP HIS PLAN ""SECRET."" IT TURNS OUT, THE SECRET IS THAT  HE HAS NO PLAN. THAT WAS VERY CLEAR WHEN HE SAID, ""I KNOW MORE ABOUT ISIS  THAN THE GENERALS."" NO, DONALD, YOU DON'T. HE ALSO SAID MORE PEOPLE SHOULD  HAVE WEAPONS, INCLUDING THE  MIDDLE EAST.  HE SPOKE ABOUT WALKING AWAY FROM  OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES. HE EVEN SAID THAT UNITED STATES  MILITARY WAS A DISASTER. I WISH HE HAD SPENT AS MUCH TIME AS JOE AND I HAVE MEETING THE  BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE MILITARY, MEETING THEIR FAMILIES, MEETING WITH GOLD STAR FAMILY'S.  THOSE ARE NOT THE WORDS OF  SOMEONE THAT RESPECTS OUR  MILITARY AND THE SACRIFICE THAT  ARE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN MAKE EVERY SINGLE DAY.   I SAID IN PHILADELPHIA THAT A MAN YOU CAN  BAKE WITH A TWEET IS NOT A MAN  YOU CAN TRUST WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS. IT IS ALSO NOT A MAN YOU CAN  TRUST TO RUN OUR ECONOMY, HEALTH  HEAL OUR CITIES, OR BE A ROLE  MODEL FOR OUR CHILDREN. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT DONALD TRUMP IS TEMPERAMENTALLY UNFIT  TO BE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES  AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF -- COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. AMERICA DESERVES SOMEONE THAT  CAN GET THE JOB DONE, BRING US  TOGETHER AND NOT TERRORISTS APART, AND GIVE JOBS TO HARD-WORKING AMERICANS.  I'M ASKING YOU TO JOIN -- AND  NOT TEAR US APART. GIVE JOBS TO WORKING CLASS  AMERICANS. I'M ASKING YOU TO JOIN RIGHT NOW.  GO TO HILLARY CLINTON.COM. WE ARE HIRING ORGANIZERS RIGHT HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA AND ACROSS  THE COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO RUN A BIDDERS CAMPAIGN ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA -- A RIGOROUS CAMPAIGN ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A FUTURE  THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY DESERVES.  I AM SURE WE CAN DO THIS,  ESPECIALLY WITH THIS MAN OF  FIGHTING ALONGSIDE US LIKE HE  ALWAYS HAS. SCRANTON, PLEASE, LET US GIVE IT  UP FOR THE VICE RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN.

THANK YOU SO MUCH. I HAVE TO TELL YOU I AM THRILLED TO BE HERE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. FIRST, IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE BACK IN MICHIGAN. YOU CAN REALLY FEEL THE ENERGY AND DYNAMISM THAT IS DRIVING THIS STATE'S COME BACK. IN DETROIT, WE HAVE GOT NEW BUSINESSES OPENING, NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE MIDTOWN AND EASTERN MARKET ARE COMING BACK. THE AUTO INDUSTRY JUST HAD IT BEST YEAR EVER.   HIGH-TECH FIRMS ARE THRIVING.  THE NEXT GENERATION OF ENGINEERS ARE GETTING TRAINED, AND HERE, SO WELL NAMED, YOU ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF WHAT I BELIEVE  WILL BE A TRUE MANUFACTURING RENAISSANCE IN AMERICA.   I JUST WAS GIVEN A SHORT BUT EXCITING TOUR BY MARK AND JOHN WHO WERE TELLING ME  ABOUT HOW THIS COMPANY WAS STARTED AS AND FOR MOST OF ITS  EARLY HISTORY, WAS AN AUTO SUPPLY COMPANY. THEN IN 2000 AS THE MARKET BEGAN TO CHANGE AND SOME OF THE AUTO  COMPANIES BEGIN TO REALIGN, THEY WERE FACED WITH A CHOICE. WE ALL FACE CHOICES IN LIFE, DON'T WE? THIS COMPANY COULD HAVE JUST SAID, HEY, YOU KNOW, OUR BUSINESS WILL NOT BE WHAT IT WAS. WE HAVE GOT TO JUST PULLED UP AND LET'S JUST KIND OF QUIT. BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED  HERE. WHAT HAPPENED HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED ACROSS AMERICA. YOU ARE IN NOW WHAT IS LARGELY AN AEROSPACE COMPANY.   AND BECAUSE OF THE WORKFORCE AND THE WORK ETHIC, AND THE COMMITMENT, OF FUTURE -- YOU ARE SEEING THE FUTURE UNFOLD. SO I GOT TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE, TO HELP BUILD THE ROCKET THAT IS GOING TO GO TO MARS.   I SAW THE TWO HALVES OF AN F 35 NOSECONE WAITING TO BE PUT TOGETHER. I TALKED WITH SOME OF THE WORKERS ABOUT THE ABSOLUTE FIRST -- PERFECTION REQUIRED TO DO THE WORK. WHAT I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART IS WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE CAN HAPPEN IS SO MANY PLACE AS IF WE PUT OUR MINDS TO IT, IF WE SUPPORTED MASS MANUFACTURING, IF WE ARE THE KINDS OF COUNTRY THAT  ONCE AGAIN UNDERSTAND HOW  IMPORTANT IT IS TO BUILD CASE.  WE ARE BUILDERS WHO NEED TO GET BACK TO BUILDING.   SO WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS. NONE OF US CAN BE SATISFIED UNTIL THE ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION WE ARE'S BEING IN  SOME PARTS OF MICHIGAN REACHES EVERY COMMUNITY, BUT IT IS INSPIRING TO SEE THIS COMBINATION OF OLD-FASHIONED HARD WORK AND CUTTING EDGE INNOVATION. I KNOW MY OPPONENTS IN THE ELECTION WAS HERE IN MICHIGAN ABOUT WEEK AGO AND IT WAS LIKE HE WAS IN A DIFFERENT PLACE.  WHEN HE VISITED DETROIT ON MONDAY, HE TALKED ONLY OF FAILURE, POVERTY, AND CRIME. HE IS MISSING SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT MAKES MICHIGAN GREAT.   AND THE SAME IS TRUE WHEN IT COMES TO OUR COUNTRY. HE DESCRIBES AMERICA AS AN EMBARRASSMENT. HE SAID, AND I QUOTE, WE ARE BECOMING A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY. LOOK AROUND YOU, MY END. GO VISIT WITH THE WORKERS BUILDING ROCKETS.  THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES.   WE HAVE A LOT OF URGENT AND IMPORTANT WORK TO DO  AND THAT IS WHAT I WILL TALK ABOUT TODAY. ALL THE PEOPLE I HAVE MET  THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN REALLY PROVE HOW WRONG THIS NEGATIVE, PESSIMISTIC VIEW IS. AMERICA'S BEST DAYS ARE STILL AHEAD OF US, IF WE MAKE UP OUR MINDS TO GO OUT AND MAKE THAT HAPPEN.   JUST CONSIDER OUR ASSETS. WE HAVE THE MOST DYNAMIC, PRODUCTIVE WORKFORCE IN THE WORLD, BAR NONE.   WE HAVE THE NOTE -- THE MOST INNOVATIVE BUSINESSES, TOP COLLEGES, UNIVERSITIES, COMMUNITY COLLEGES, TRAINING PROGRAMS IN  THE WORLD, AND THE BEST SCIENCE  AND TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE ENORMOUS CAPACITY FOR CLEAN ENERGY PRODUCTION TO WE ARE RESILIENT, DETERMINED, HARD-WORKING. THERE IS NOTHING AMERICA CANNOT DO IF WE DO IT TOGETHER. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE THIS IS HOW I WAS RAISED. I DO NOT THINK MR. TRUMP UNDERSTANDS ANY OF IT. WE HAVE OFFERED CREDIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THE VERY REAL ECONOMIC CHALLENGES WE FACE. THOSE CHALLENGES EMERGED LONG  BEFORE THE GREAT RECESSION AND THEY HAVE PERSISTED THROUGH OUR RECOVERY. THERE IS TOO MUCH INEQUALITY, TOO LITTLE UPWARD MOBILITY. IT IS JUST TOO HARD TO GET AHEAD TODAY. BUT THERE ARE COMMON SENSE THINGS YOUR GOVERNMENT COULD DO THAT WOULD GIVE AMERICANS MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO SUCCEED. WE DON'T DO IT BECAUSE POWERFUL  SPECIAL INTERESTS AND THE TENDENCY TO PUT IDEOLOGY AHEAD OF POLITICAL PROGRESS HAVE LED TO GRIDLOCK IN CONGRESS. HOW CAN YOU NOT BE FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY WHEN YOU SEE NOTHING GETTING DONE? A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL KNOW WHAT IS ON THEIR SIDE AND NO ONE HAS THEIR BACK. THAT IS NOT HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN AMERICA. IF I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT, I HAVE YOUR BACK EVERY SINGLE DAY.  MY MISSION IN THE WHITE HOUSE WILL BE TO MAKE THE ECONOMY WORK  FOR EVERYONE AND NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. THIS IS PERSONAL FOR ME. I AM THE PRODUCT OF THE AMERICAN MIDDLE-CLASS. I WAS BORN IN CHICAGO, RAISED IN  THE SUBURB.  BUT MY GRANDFATHER WORKED AT THE SCRANTON MILL IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA. MY DAD WILL BE A WILL TO GO TO COLLEGE AND EVENTUALLY SMALL  BUSINESS, AND SEND ME OUT INTO THE WORLD TO FOLLOW MY OWN DREAMS. I HAVE ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE DAUGHTER OF A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AND THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FACTORY OWNER AND PROUD OF BOTH.  WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT BARGAIN ON EVEN BETTER TERMS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY, IT DEPENDS IN LARGE MEASURE ON THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION. HERE ARE FOUR QUESTIONS I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL ASK OF BOTH CANDIDATES. THE ANSWERS SHOULD HELP MAKE YOUR CHOICE IN NOVEMBER CRYSTAL  CLEAR WHICH CANDIDATE HAS A REAL PLAN TO CREATE GOOD PAYING JOBS? SECOND, WHO WILL ENSURE THAT THOSE AT THE TOP PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES.   THIRD, WHO WILL REALLY GO TO BAT FOR FAMILIES, AND FOURTH, WHO WILL REALLY GO TOGETHER AND DELIVER RESULTS THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR LIVES?   NOW I HOPE THAT AFTER GIVING A FAIR HEARING TO BOTH SIDES, YOU WILL JOIN THE  MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY SUPPORTING THIS CAMPAIGN, NOT JUST DEMOCRATS BUT A GROWING NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS AS WELL. WHEN IT COMES TO CREATING JOBS,  I WOULD ARGUE IT'S NOT EVEN  CLOSE. EVEN CONSERVATIVE EXPERTS SAY TRUMP'S'S AGENDA WILL PULL OUR ECONOMY BACK INTO A RECESSION. ANALYSIS BY FORMER ECONOMIC  ADVISER BY SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN, YOU ADD UP ALL OF THE IDEAS FROM CUTTING TAXES TO STARTING A TRADE WAR WITH CHINA TO DEPORTING MILLIONS OF HARD-WORKING MILLIONS, THE RESULT WOULD BE A LOSS OF 3.4 MILLION JOBS.   BY CONTRAST, THE SAME ANALYST FOUND THAT OUR PLAN, THE ECONOMY WOULD CREATE  MORE THAN 10 MILLION NEW JOBS.  LET ME TELL YOU HOW WE WOULD DO THAT.  I BELIEVE EVERY AMERICAN WILLING TO WORK HARD SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND A JOB AND DECENT PAY BACK AND SUPPORT THE FAMILY. STARTING ON DAY ONE, WE WILL WORK WITH BOTH PARTIES TO PASS THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN NEW, GOOD PAYING JOBS, SINCE WORLD  WAR II.   WE WILL PUT AMERICANS TO WORK, BUILDING AND  MODERNIZING OUR ROADS, BRIDGES, TUNNELS, RAILWAYS, AIRPORTS.   WE ARE WAY OVERDUE FOR THIS. WE ARE LIVING OFF OF THE  INVESTMENTS MADE BY OUR PARENTS  AND GRANDPARENTS GENERATION. WE ALSO HELP CITIES LIKE DETROIT AND FLINT CONNECT UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS TO OPPORTUNITY EXPANDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND  WE WILL PREPARE SCHOOLS AND FAILING WATER SYSTEMS AS WELL.   I HAPPEN TO THINK WE SHOULD BE AMBITIOUS.  WHILE WE'RE AT IT, WE SHOULD  PUSH EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN AMERICA TO BROADBAND BY THE YEAR 2020.   IT IS ASTONISHING TO ME HOW MANY PLACES IN AMERICA, NOT WAY FAR AWAY FROM CITIES, BUT IN CITIES, AND NEAR CITIES, THAT DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND. THAT DISADVANTAGES KIDS WHO ARE ASKED TO DO HOMEWORK USING THE INTERNET, 5 MILLION OF THEM LIVE AT HOMES WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. YOU TALK ABOUT THE ACHIEVEMENT  GAP, IT STARTS RIGHT THERE. LET'S BUILD A CLEANER AND MORE RESILIENT POWER GRID WITH ENOUGH RENEWABLE ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME IN OUR COUNTRY AS WELL.   SOME COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF THE 21ST CENTURY AND CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS AND BUSINESSES. IT WILL PROBABLY BE CHINA, GERMANY, AND AMERICA. I WOULD WANT IT TO BE US. WE SHOULD MAKE IT AND USE IT AND EXPORTED. AND HERE IS SOMETHING YOU DO NOT ALWAYS HEAR ENOUGH OF FROM DEMOCRATS. TO CREATE MORE JOBS AT A HIGHER PAY. THAT MEANS, FOR US, CREATING AN INFRASTRUCTURE BANK TO GET PRIVATE FUNDS OFF THE SIDELINES AND COMPLEMENT OUR PRIVATE INVESTMENT, 25 OF IN DOLLARS IN GOVERNMENT FUNDING COULD UNLOCK  MORE THAN $250 BILLION AND REALLY GET OUR COUNTRY MOVING ON OUR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN, AND $10 BILLION IN WHAT WE CALL MAKE IT IN AMERICA PARTNERSHIP TO SUPPORT AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND RECOMMIT RESEARCH TO CREATE ENTIRE NEW JOBS. WHEN I WAS TALKING TO WORKERS ALONG THE WAY AND ASKING THEM  WERE SOME OF THE PRECISION MACHINERY CAME FROM THAT IS BEING USED HERE, IT IS WHAT I HEAR ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. GERMANY, JAPAN, ITALY. I WANT TO BRING THAT DECISION MANUFACTURING BACK TO THE UNITED STATES.  THERE IS NO REASON WE CANNOT  BEGIN TO MAKE THOSE MACHINES OURSELVES AND SUPPLY THE REST OF THE WORLD INSTEAD OF BUYING FROM SOMEWHERE  LET'S ALSO EXPAND INCENTIVES LIKE THE NEW MARKET TAX THAT IS THAT CAN BRING BUSINESSES, GOVERNMENT, AND COMMUNITIES TOGETHER TO CREATE GOOD JOBS AND PLACES THAT WILL BE LEFT OUT AND LEFT BEHIND. FROM NEGLECTED NEIGHBORHOODS  INTO CHOICE AND FIND, TO LOGGING COUNTRY, COAL COUNTRY, NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES, RURAL AREAS, RAVAGED BY ADDICTION AND LOST JOBS, TO A REGION HOW ABOUT WHEN FACTORIES CLOSE. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL ALSO MAKE A MAJOR PUSH TO EMPOWER SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS.   WITH NEW NATIONAL INITIATIVES TO CUT RED TAPE AT EVERY LEVEL AND ASKED AND ACCESS TO CREDIT, ESPECIALLY THROUGH COMMUNITY BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS. I WILL PROPOSE A NEW PLAN TO DRAMATICALLY SIMPLIFY TAX FILING FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.   RIGHT NOW, THE SMALLEST BUSINESSES, THE KIND MY  DAD HAD, A REALLY SMALL BUSINESS, SPENT 20 TIMES MORE  PER EMPLOYEE TO PREPARE THEIR TAXES COMPARED TO LARGER COMPANIES. IT SHOULD BE AS EASY AS PRINTING  OUT A BANK STATEMENT. LET'S FREE ENTREPRENEURS TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST.  INNOVATE, GROW, AND HIGHER.   MARK SAID THIS COMPANY STARTED BECAUSE OF A DRIVE DOWN THE ROAD, THINKING ABOUT IT AND TALK ABOUT IT, ONE OF THE OLDSMOBILE -- DECIDING NOT ONLY DO I HAVE AN IDEA, IN AMERICA, IF YOU CAN TREATMENT,  YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD IT. WE WILL GET BACK TO DOING THAT.   NOW DONALD TRUMP HAS A DIFFERENT VIEW.  HE HAS MADE A CAREER OUT OF STIFFING SMALL BUSINESSES, FROM  ATLANTIC CITY TO LAS VEGAS. THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT WERE LEFT HANGING BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO PAY THEIR BILLS. A LOT OF THOSE COMPANIES SCRAPED  TOGETHER WHAT THEY COULD TO PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES, AND MANY OF THEM PUT THEIR BUSINESSES AT  RISK AND SOME OF THEM ENDED UP TAKING BANKRUPTCIES. IT WAS NOT BECAUSE TRUMP COULD NOT PAY THEM.  IT IS BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT PAY  THEM. THAT IS WHY I TAKE IT PERSONALLY.  MY DAD RAN A PRINTING PLANT. HE HAD TO REALLY LONG TABLES. HE PRINTED FOR DRAPERIES. HE WOULD LAY OUT THE FABRIC AND THEN WOULD TAKE A SILKSCREEN AND  HE WOULD GO DOWN THE TABLE AND PUT IT DOWN, TAKE THE SQUEEGEE, GO ACROSS THE SCREEN, LIFTED UP, GO DOWN, ALL THE WAY AT THE END AND THEN DART AT THE OTHER TABLE. HE WORKED HARD AND THEN WHEN HE  FINISHED, HE WOULD LOAD UP THE FABRIC, PUT IT IN HIS CAR, AND TAKE IT TO THE BUSINESS THAT HAD ORDERED IT. MAYBE A RESTAURANT OR A HOTEL OR SOME OFFICE. HE EXPECTED TO BE PAID WHEN HE SHOWED UP. HE DID THE WORK. HE PAID FOR THE SUPPLIES FOR THE LABOR REQUIRED ON BIG JOBS. HE EXPECTED TO BE PAID. I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED TO MY FATHER AND HIS BUSINESS IF HE HAD GOTTEN A CONTRACT FROM TRUMP. SHELLING OUT AND SUBMITTING HIS  BILL, HE IS TOLD WE ARE NOT GOING TO PAY AND IF YOU DO NOT LIKE IT, SUE US. MY FATHER COULD NEVER HAVE SUED A BIG ORGANIZATION LIKE THAT. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT. I HAVE MET ALL KINDS OF WORKERS, PAINTERS, PLUMBERS, I HAVE MET  SMALL BUSINESSES THAT PROVIDED PIANO'S AND GLASS AND MARBLE,  ALL OF WHOM WERE DENIED PAYMENT,  AND AFTER GOING BACK TIME AND AGAIN AND BEING TOLD, MAYBE WE WILL TAKE -- MAYBE WE WILL PAY YOU $.50 ON THE DOLLAR, IT IS NOT HOW WE DO BUSINESS IN AMERICA. WE HAVE GOT TO CREATE MORE GOOD JOBS THAT ARE GOING TO HELP MORE PEOPLE. OUR MODERN SERVICE ECONOMY IS EMPOWERING CONSUMERS WITH MORE CHOICES AND GREATER FLEXIBILITY,  BUT WE DO HAVE TO EMPOWER THE WORKERS IN OUR SERVICE SECTOR. THE PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF OUR CHILDREN AND OUR PARENTS, THEY DESERVE A GOOD WAGE AND GOOD BENEFITS AND A CURE RETIREMENT.   AND IT IS CRUCIAL THAT EVERY AMERICAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE EDUCATION AND THE HILLS A NEED TO GET THE JOBS IN THE FUTURE. SO WE WILL FIGHT TO MAKE COLLEGE TUITION FREE FOR THE MIDDLE-CLASS AND DEBT FREE FOR  EVERYONE.   WE WILL ALSO LIBERATE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO  ALREADY HAVE STUDENT DEBT BY MAKING IT EASIER TO REFINANCE AND REPAY WHAT YOU ALL AS A PORTION OF YOUR INCOME SO YOU DO  NOT HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORDAND JUST NOT RIGHT DONALD TRUMP -- IT IS JUST NOT RIGHT DONALD TRUMP CAN IGNORE HIS DEBT BUT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES CANNOT REFINANCE THEIR DEBT.  HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE I WANT TO -- EMPHASIZE.  I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN AMERICA IS TALKING ABOUT THIS ENOUGH,  AND THAT IS A FOUR YEAR DEGREE SHOULD NOT BE THE ONLY PATH TO A GOOD JOB IN AMERICA.  YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LEARN A SKILL, PRACTICE A TRADE, MAKE A GOOD LIVING DOING IT. SO MANY AMERICANS HAVE THE TALENT AND WILL TO SUCCEED,  WHETHER THEIR KID IS RIGHT AT A PRICE WAR OLDER PEOPLE DISPLACED BY AUTOMATION AND OUTSOURCING. BEFORE LONG, BIG PROMISES ABOUT THE POWER OF TRAINING -- THE PROMISE OF TRAINING AND  RE-TRAINING HAVE NOT DELIVERED LIKE THEY SHOULD.  IT IS MY ANYONE TO BE TRAINED FOR A JOB THAT DOES NOT EXIST. HERE IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. WE WILL SUPPORT-ALREADY UNION TRAINING PROGRAMS. WE WILL PROPOSE NEW TAX CREDITS TO ENCOURAGE MORE COMPANIES TO  OFFER PAID APPRENTICESHIP THAT LET YOU EARN WHILE YOU LEARN. WE WILL DO MORE, INCLUDING A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO DIGNIFY SKILLS TRAINING ACROSS THE  BOARD. I THINK WE HAVE TO REVERSE WHAT HAS BECOME A KIND OF COMMONPLACE VIEW, WHICH IS EVERYBODY NEEDS TO GO TO COLLEGE. IN FACT, MORE THAN HALF OF THE JOBS THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE IN 2020 DO NOT REQUIRE A COLLEGE FOUR-YEAR DEGREES. FOR WELDERS AND MACHINISTS AND HEALTH TECHNICIANS IN SO MANY OTHERS, LET'S GET THE WORD OUT,  THERE ARE REALLY GOOD JOBS FOR PEOPLE RIGHT NOW, AND THERE WILL BE MORE IN THE FUTURE IF YOU GET THIS TELLS AN HIGH SCHOOL, AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE,  APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM OR OTHER  PROGRAM. AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GREAT ROLE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE  HERE HAS PLAYED IN WORKING WITH COMPANIES LIKE THIS ONE TO MAKE  SURE PEOPLE DO HAVE THE SKILLS. I IMAGINE SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE THINKING THAT ALL SOUNDS GOOD, BUT WHAT ABOUT TRADE? AFTER ALL, TRUMP TALKS ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME. LET'S START WITH THIS, IT IS TRUE TOO OFTEN PASSED TRADE DEALS HAVE BEEN SOLD TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH ROSIE SCENARIOS THAT DID NOT PAN OUT. THOSE PROMISES NOW RING HOLLOW IN MANY COMMUNITIES ACROSS MICHIGAN AND OUR COUNTRY THAT HAVE SEEN FACTORIES CLOSE AND JOBS DISAPPEAR. TOO MANY COMPANY LOBBIED FOR TRADE DEAL SO THEY COULD SELL PRODUCT ABROAD BUT THEN THEY INSTEAD MOVED ABROAD AND SOLD BACK INTO THE UNITED STATES. ENFORCEMENT, PARTICULARLY DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN TOO LAX. INVESTMENTS AT HOME THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE COMPETITIVE. THE ANSWER IS NOT TO RANT AND RAVE OR CUT OURSELVES OFF FROM  THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD, THE ANSWER IS TO FINALLY MAKE TRADE WORK FOR US, NOT AGAINST US. SO MY MESSAGE TO EVERY WORKER IN MICHIGAN AND ACROSS AMERICA IS THIS, I WILL STOP ANY TRADE DEAL  OR KILLS JOBS OR HOLDS DOWN WAGES, INCLUDING THE TRANS-SPECIFIC -- TRANSPACIFIC  PARTNERSHIP. I OPPOSE IT NOW, I OPPOSE IT AFTER THE ELECTION AND AS PRESIDENT. I BOUGHT TO DEFEND NEW YORK MANUFACTURERS AND STEELMAKERS  FROM UNFAIR CHINESE TRADING PRACTICES. I OPPOSE THE ONLY MULTILATERAL TRADE DEAL THAT CAME BEFORE THE SENATE WHILE I WAS THERE BECAUSE IT DID NOT MEET MY HIGH BAR. AS SECRETARY OF STATE I FOUGHT HARD FOR AMERICAN BUSINESSES TO GET A FAIR SHOT AROUND THE WORLD AND STOP UNDERHANDED TRADING PRACTICES LIKE CURRENCY MANIPULATION AND THAT'S LEFT OF  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. AS PRESIDENT I WILL STAND UP TO CHINA AND ANYONE ELSE WHO TRIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AMERICAN WORKERS AND COMPANIES.  AND I AM GOING TO RAMP UP ENFORCEMENT BY APPOINTING FOR THE FIRST TIME A CHEAP TRADE PROSECUTOR. I WILL TRIPLE THE NUMBER OF  ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS, AND WHEN COUNTRIES BREAK THE RULES, WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO IMPOSE TARGETED TARA-- TARRIFS.  NOW, MR. TRUMP MAY TALK OF BIG GAME ON TRADE BUT HIS APPROACH -- A BASED ON TRADE -- FEAR, NOT TRADE.  FEAR THAT WE CANNOT COMPETE WITH  THE REST OF THE WORLD, EVEN WHEN RULES ARE FAIR. FEAR THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS NO  CHOICE BUT TO HIDE BEHIND WALLS. IF TEAM USA WAS AS FEARFUL AS STRONG, MICHAEL PHELPS AND SIMONE BILES WOULD BE COWERING  IN THE LOCKER ROOM AFRAID TO COME OUT AND COMPETE. INSTEAD, THEY ARE WINNING GOLD MEDALS. AMERICA IS NOT AFRAID TO COMPETE. WE WANT THEM TO SELL EVEN MORE AND CREATE EVEN MORE JOBS HERE AT HOME. CORPORATIONS DO NOT ABANDON PROFITABLE OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES TO MOVE ABROAD  JUST TO GIVE SHAREHOLDERS A QUICKER RETURN. BEFORE HE TWEETS --  ABOUT HOW HE IS REALLY THE ONE  WHO WILL PUT AMERICA FIRST AND TRADE, LET'S REMEMBER WHERE TRUMP MAKES MANY OF HIS OWN PRODUCTS, BECAUSE IT SURE IS NOT AMERICA. HE HAS MADE TRUMP TIES IN CHINA AND SINCE IN MEXICO AND THAT A MICHIGAN. WE CREATED A WEBSITE. HILLARYCLINTON.COM/MAKEITHERE. ON IT WE LIST 100 PLACES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THAT ARE ALREADY PRODUCING SIMILAR GOODS. ONE POSITIVE THING TRUMP COULD DO TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IS TO ACTUALLY MAKE GREAT THINGS IN AMERICA AGAIN. WHICH CANDIDATE WILL FIGHT FOR FAIRNESS? THIS IS AN URGENT NEED. WE NEED TO GROW THE ECONOMY AND MAKE IT FAIRER. THE TIDE IS NOT RISING FAST ENOUGH AND CERTAINLY NOT LISTING ALL BOTH. SINCE THE CRASH, TOO MANY OF THE  GAINS HAVE GONE TO THE TOP 1%. PUTTING SHORT-TERM STOCK PRICES  ALONG LONG TIME INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT AND RESEARCH. WHILE CORPORATE PROFITS ARE AT  NEAR RECORD HIGH, PAYCHECKS FOR MOST PEOPLE HAVE BARELY BUDGE. INCOMES ARE GROWING FAST -- ARE NOT GROWING TO KEEP UP WITH THE  COST OF LIVING. I BELIEVE EVERY EMPLOYEE TO THE CEO SUITE AND FACTORY FLOOR CONTRIBUTES TO A BUSINESS OF SUCCESS. EVERYONE SHOULD SHARE IN THE REWARDS. ESPECIALLY THOSE PUTTING IN LONG HOURS FOR LITTLE PAY. I AM ENCOURAGING -- ENCOURAGING A NEW TAX CREDIT.  MORE BROADLY, WE WILL FIGHT FOR  A MORE PROGRESSIVE OR PATRIOTIC TAX CODE. OUTSOURCING JOBS AND PRODUCTION  COULD WRITE OFF THE COST. WE MUST STOP THAT AND MUST MAKE THEM PAY BACK ANY TAX BREAK THEY EVER RECEIVED THEM ANY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT IN OUR COUNTRY. FOR THOSE THAT MOVE THEIR HEADQUARTERS OVERSEAS TO AVOID PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES , THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY A NEW EXIT TAX. IF THEY WANT GO, THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY TO GO. WALL STREET CORPORATIONS IN THE  SUPER RICH SHOULD FINALLY PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES. THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT THE SO-CALLED BUFFET RURAL. MULTIBILLIONAIRE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PAY A LOWER TAX RATE THAN THEIR SECRETARY.  WE SHOULD ALSO ADD A NEW TAX ON MULTIMILLIONAIRES. CRACKDOWN ON TAX GAMING BY  CORPORATIONS AND CLOSE THE KERRY INTEREST LOOPHOLE, SOMETHING I  HAVE ADVOCATED FOR YEARS. -- CLOSE THE CARRY INTEREST LOOPHOLE.  THERE IS A MYTH OUT THERE THAT TRUMP WILL STICK IT TO THE RICH AND POWERFUL, BECAUSE SOMEHOW HE IS REALLY ON THE SIDE OF THE LITTLE GUY. DON'T BELIEVE IT. NOT WHEN HE PLEDGES TO RIP UP  BASIC RULES THAT HOLD CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTABLE. WHEN HE WANTS TO SCRAP REGULATIONS TO STOP LOOTERS FROM POISONING THE AIR OUR CHILDREN BREATHE AND THE WATER WE DRINK. TRUMP WILL ROLL BACK THE TOUGH RULES WE HAVE IMPOSED ON THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY.  I WILL DO THE OPPOSITE. I THINK WE SHOULD STRENGTHEN THOSE SO WALL STREET CAN NEVER WRECKED MAIN STREET AGAIN. TRUMP EVEN WANTS TO ABOLISH THE  CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. A NEW AGENCY HAS ALREADY RETURNED MORE THAN $11 BILLION TO 25 MILLION AMERICANS WHO WERE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY CORPORATIONS. THEN THERE IS THE TAX PLAN, HE WOULD GIVE TRILLIONS TO MONEY MANAGERS. THAT WOULD EXPLODE THE NATIONAL  DEBT AND EVENTUALLY LEAD TO MASSIVE CUTS AND PRIORITIES LIKE  EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS. IN HIS SPEECH MONDAY HE CALLS FOR A NEW TAX LOOPHOLE. LET'S CALL IT THE TRUMP LOOPHOLE . IT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO PAY LESS THAN HALF THE CURRENT TAX RATE ON INCOME FOR MANY OF HIS COMPANIES. HE WOULD PAY A LOWER RATE THAN MILLIONS OF MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES. ONE NONPARTISAN EXPERT AT THE TAX POLICY CENTER DESCRIBED THIS  PLAN AS A REALLY NICE DEAL, FOR DONALD TRUMP. IT IS HARD TO SAY HOW NICE  BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO WHAT EVERY OTHER CANDIDATE HAS DONE AND RELEASE HIS TAX RETURN.  BUT WE DO KNOW THE 400 RICHEST TAXPAYERS AND AMERICA WOULD GET AN AVERAGE TAX CUTS OF MORE THAN $15 MILLION PER YEAR FROM THE TRUMP LOOPHOLE. THEN THERE IS THE ESTATE TAX, WHICH TRUMP ONCE TO ELIMINATE ALTOGETHER. IF YOU BELIEVE HE IS AS WEALTHY AS HE SAYS, THAT ALONE WOULD SAVE THE TRUMP FAMILY FORM ALIEN DOLLARS. -- TRUMP FAMILY $4 BILLION. THEY WOULD GET A $4 BILLION TAX CUT, AND 99.8% OF AMERICANS WOULD GET NOTHING. JUST THINK OF WHAT WE COULD DO  WITH THE $4 BILLION? WE COULD PROVIDE A YEARS WORTH OF HEALTH CARE TO NEARLY 3 MILLIONBUT WE DO KIDS. I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF BETTER WAYS TO SPEND THE MONEY. MONDAY I WILL BE IN SCRANTON -- SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA, WITH VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN.  HE SAYS DON'T TELL ME WHAT YOU VALUE, SHOW ME YOUR BUDGET AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU VALUE. DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO GIVE  TRILLIONS IN TAX BREAKS TO  PEOPLE LIKE HIMSELF.  I WANT TO INVEST IT IN VETERANS, POLICE OFFICERS, AND SO MUCH  MORE. YOU CAN THEN DRAW YOUR OWN CONCLUSION ABOUT VALUES. HE IS MAKING A BIG PROMISE, BUT HIS ADVISERS HAVE SAID, HE MAY NOT STAND BY THEM. THE TAX CUTS HE DOUBLED DOWN ON OFFER TRILLIONS TO THE RICHEST AMERICANS AND CORPORATIONS. WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND ME? I AM TELLING WHAT I WILL DO COME LAYING OUT MY PLAN, AND I WILL STAND BY THEM, AND WANT TO YOU TO HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE FOR DELIVERING RESULTS. THIS REMINDS ME OF THE OLD SAYING, IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO  BE TRUE, IT PROBABLY IS.  THAT BRINGS US TO THE THIRD QUESTION, WHICH CANDIDATE CAN YOU CAPS ON TO GO TO BAT FOR WORKERS AND MIDDLE-CLASS  FAMILIES YOU COME IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO PAY LIP SERVICE TO BE ON YOUR SIDE.  WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE HOW AMERICANS ACTUALLY LIVE AND WORK  IN THE 21ST CENTURY AND THEN OFFER REAL SOLUTIONS THAT MAKE  YOUR LIFE EASIER. WE KNOW WOMEN ARE NOW THE SOLE OR PRIMARY BREADWINNER IN A ROWING NUMBER OF FAMILIES. WE KNOW THAT MORE AMERICANS ARE  COBBLING TOGETHER PART-TIME WORK  OR STRIKING OUT ON THEIR OWN, SO WE HAVE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO BE GOOD WORKERS AND CAREGIVERS ALL AT THE SAME TIME. THAT IS WHY I HAVE SET OUT A  VISION TO MAKE QUALITY, AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE AVAILABLE TO ALL AMERICANS AND LIMIT THE COST TO 10% OF FAMILY INCOME. ON MONDAY TRUMP OFFERED HIS  FIRST REAL IDEA ON THIS TOPIC. PREVIOUSLY HE DISMISSED IDEAS ABOUT CHILDCARE. HE SAID IT WAS NOT AN EXPENSIVE THING.  NOW HE SAID HE WANTS TO EXCLUDE CHILDCARE PAYMENTS FROM  TAXATION. BECAUSE IT IS TRANSPARENTLY DENIED FOR RICH PEOPLE. SHE WOULD GET -- BECAUSE SHE WOULD GET 30 OR $.40 ON THE DOLLAR FOR HER NANNY AND LITTLE OR NOTHING TO FAMILIES TRYING TO AFFORD CHILDCARE SO THEY CAN GET TO WORK AND KEEP A JOB. I THINK INSTEAD WE SHOULD EXPAND -- EXPAND THE CHILD TAX CREDIT TO PROVIDE REAL RELIEF TO TENS  OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WORKING AND STRUGGLING WITH THE COST. THE SAME FAMILY THAT HIS PLAN  IGNORES. THE MORE WE DO TO HELP WORKING FAMILIES, THE MORE THE ENTIRE ECONOMY WILL BENEFIT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY TRUMP IS AGAINST THAT. PAID FAMILY LEAVE WILL ONLY MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR MOMS AND DADS. IT WILL KEEP SKILLED, TALENTED AMERICANS IN THE WORKFORCE AND GROW OUR ECONOMY. THAT IS WHY EVERY OTHER ADVANCE ECONOMY ALREADY HAS IT. RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE WILL NOT JUST PUT MORE MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES, IT MEANS THEY WILL SPEND MORE AT THE BUSINESSES IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVEN THE  ORIGINAL AUTOMAKERS UNDERSTOOD WAY BACK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE  20TH CENTURY WHEN THEY DECIDED TO PAY THE UNBELIEVABLE SUM OF FIVE DOLLARS PER DAY TO AUTO WORKERS.  AND WHEN THEY WERE CRITICIZED BY OTHER BUSINESSES, THEY HAVE THE BEST ANSWER, WE WANT PEOPLE TO  BE ABLE TO BUY OUR CARS. THIS IS ECONOMICS 101. WE NEED TO GET INCOMES AND WAGES RISING, AND IT WILL HELP THE  WHOLE ECONOMY GROW AND BE  FAIRER. FROM TEXTING AND EXPANDING SOCIAL SECURITY, IT DOES NOT JUST HELP OLDER AMERICANS. IT HELPS TO EASE BURDENS. I OFTEN THINK THE SAME THING ABOUT COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION ARM.  WE ALREADY HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORKING IN THE ECONOMY AND PAYING 12 BILLION PER YEAR TO SOCIAL SECURITY, EVEN THOUGH  THEY ARE UNDOCUMENTED.  BY MOVING TOWARD REFORM, WE WILL UNLEASH A LOT OF NEW INCOME AND GROWTH AND LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD SO AMERICAN WORKERS CANNOT  BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BECAUSE  UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS CAN BE EX AVOIDED BY EMPLOYERS, WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVE THIS DISCONNECT. FINALLY, STRENGTHENING UNIONS  DOES NOT JUST SERVE MEMBERS, IT LEADS TO BETTER PAY AND BENEFITS AND WORKING CONDITIONS FOR ALL EMPLOYEES.  SO I HAVE ALSO SET I WILL DEFEND AND IMPROVE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THAT INCLUDES GIVING AMERICANS THE BETTER CHOICE OF A PUBLIC OPTION HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN THAT WILL HELP EVERYONE AFFORD COVERAGE. THESE ARE ALL CAUSES I HAVE WORKED ON FOR DECADES, AND I BELIEVE THEY POINT TO A FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH ABOUT THE ECONOMY. IT CAN SEEM LIKE ZERO SUM WHEN  YOU ARE COMPETING FOR A JOB, PROMOTION, OR CONTRACT IF SOMEONE WINS AND LOSES, BUT THAT IS NOT THE FULL PICTURE. IF YOU STEP BACK, YOU CAN SEE WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. IF WE GROW TOGETHER, WE CAN ALL RISE TOGETHER. YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE TO SAY, WE ARE ALL STRONGER TOGETHER. THE FOURTH QUESTION IS THIS, WHO  CAN BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO GET  ANY OF THIS DONE? WELL, I BELIEVE I CAN'T BECAUSE I THINK I CAN PROVIDE SERIOUS, STEADY LEADERSHIP THAT CAN FIND COMMON GROUND TO AND ON IT BASED UPON HARD BUT RESPECTFUL BARGAINING WITH THE OTHER SIDE. LEADERSHIP THAT RISES ABOVE PERSONAL ATTACKS AND  NAME-CALLING, NOT REVELS IN IT. I JUST DO NOT THINK INSULTS AND BULLYING IS HOW WE ARE TO GET THINGS DONE.  I DO NOT THINK THAT IS THE APPROPRIATE APPROACH FOR US. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY WORK  TOGETHER. I KNOW THAT'S TRUE.  I DID IT AS FIRST LADY.  IT IS HOW WE CREATED THE INSURANCE HELD -- THE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM. IT IS HOW WE REBUILT 9/11 -- NEW YORK AFTER 9/11. SO I AM CONVINCED BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE THAT WE CAN DO THIS. ONE OF THE REASONS I ASKED TIM KAINE TO BE MY RUNNING MATE IS HE IS A RECORD OF WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE TO GET THINGS DONE AS A MAYOR, GOVERNOR, AND TO BRING TOGETHER  LEADERS FROM ACROSS THE ECONOMY,  FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES TO TALK ABOUT JOBS AND COMPETITIVENESS. WE NEED THE BEST IDEAS THAT ARE OUT THERE MAKING A DIFFERENCE.  WE NEED TO PULL TOGETHER. THE BOTTOM-LINE IS THIS. I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP.  BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW FROM THE  TRUMP CAMPAIGN, HE ONCE -- WANTS  AMERICANS TO WORK FOR HIM AND HIS FRIENDS AT THE TOP. HE HAS OFFERED NOTHING ON STUDENT LOANS OF THE COST OF DESCRIPTION DRUGS, NOTHING FOR  FARMERS OR STRUGGLING RURAL  COMMUNITIES. NOTHING TO BUILD A NEW FUTURE WITH CLEAN ENERGY AND ADVANCE  AGRICULTURE. NOTHING FOR THE CITIES TO OVERCOME THE BARRIERS OF CYST IN THE GRACES HIM. NOTHING TO CREATE NEW  OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG ALL. -- NOTHING FOR CITIES TO OVERCOME THE BARRIERS OF RACISM. HIS OWN ADDITION OF TRUMP IDEAS THAT EVEN REPUBLICANS REJECT. AS WE HEARD HIM SAY AT HIS  CONVENTION, HE BELIEVES THAT HE ALONE CAN FIX OUR COUNTRY, BUT CLEARLY HE DOES NOT KNOW THE PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN.  HE DOES NOT SEE THE BUSINESSES AND LABOR UNIONS, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND CLERGY COMING TOGETHER EVERY SINGLE DAY TO MAKE THINGS BETTER. YES, THEY ARE STILL A LONG ROAD AHEAD, BUT MICHIGAN IS ON THE RISE, AND EVERYONE IS CONTRIBUTING.  THAT IS AMERICA AT ITS BEST. I HOPE YOU WILL WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE JOBS AND STRENGTHEN ITS OWN COMMUNITIES. I HOPE YOU WILL WORK TO GET OUT THE VOTE IN NOVEMBER. BECAUSE IF WE ARE ABLE TO WIN, THEN I WANT YOU ALL TO WORK WITH ME. BUILD THE KIND OF PROGRESS IN AMERICA DESERVES TO SEE.  WE WILL DO THIS TOGETHER. LET'S GO OUT AND BUILD THE FUTURE.  THANK YOU.

CLINTON: GOOD MORNING.  I AM SO PLEASED TO BE HERE.  I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION, THE INTRODUCTION, TO  EVERYONE ASSOCIATED WITH NABJ AND NAHJ. I WANT TO MARK THE MOMENT BECAUSE YOU WERE CREATED IN THIS HOTEL. I DO NOT KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY ORIGINAL FOUNDERS, BUT IF THERE ARE, COULD YOU STAND UP AND WE COULD GIVE YOU SOME RECOGNITION.   I AM DELIGHTED TO  THANK YOU FOR THE IMPORTANT WORK  YOU DO EVERY DAY, AND NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEED YOU TO KEEP HOLDING LEADERS AND CANDIDATES ACCOUNTABLE, AND IN THE TRADITION OF PAST JOURNALISTS  LIKE RUBEN SALAZAR, WE NEED YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT AMERICA'S  FRONT PAGES AND NIGHTLY NEWSCASTS AND ONLINE INFORMATION  FOR THE GREAT DIVERSITY OF OUR NATION. SOMEONE I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF KNOWING, BOB MAYNARD, FORMER OAKLAND TRIBUNE OWNER, ONCE SAID , IT IS IN SEEING OURSELVES WHOLE THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO SEE WAYS OF WORKING OUT OUR DIFFERENCES OF UNDERSTANDING OUR SIMILARITIES AND BECOMING A MORE COHESIVE NATION. AND THAT IS WHAT YOU DO EVERY DAY, HELPING US TO SEE OURSELVES AS WHOLE. LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR  DISCUSSION. WHICH I'M SURE WILL COVER A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES, BUT I WANT TO TAKE IF YOU AND IT'S TO FOCUS ON A CHALLENGE THAT DOES NOT GET ENOUGH ATTENTION ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN TRYING, AND THAT IS HOW DO WE EXPAND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND LATINOS ACROSS AMERICA. AND YOU KNOW VERY WELL IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT WHEN THE ECONOMY  CATCHES A COLD, COMMUNITIES OF COLOR GET PNEUMONIA. THE GREAT RECESSION HITS OUR WHOLE COUNTRY HARD, BUT THE TOLL  WAS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT FOR  BLACK AND LATINO FAMILIES. BLACK WEALTH WAS CUT IN HALF. FOR LATINOS, IT DROPPED 66%. THAT REPRESENTED DECADES, EVEN GENERATIONS OF HARD WORK. AND DURING THESE PAST 18 MONTHS, PEOPLE ACROSS OUR COUNTRY HAVE  DESCRIBED TO ME HOW HARD IT HAS BEEN TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET IN AN ECONOMY THAT IS STILL NOT WORKING THE WAY WE ALL WANT TO SEE IT, AND BARRIERS OF SYSTEMIC RACISM MAKE THAT EVEN HARDER. NOW, I BELIEVE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA DOES NOT GET THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR LEADING US OUT AT THE GREAT RECESSION --    AND I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND PEOPLE HE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CREATING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. HE CAME INTO OFFICE IN THIS WORST OF ALL FINANCIAL CRISES SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION WAS HANDED TO HIM. AND I THINK IF YOU FAIRLY LOOK AT THE RECORD, YOU HAVE TO CONCLUDE THAT HIS LEADERSHIP  SAVED US FROM A GREAT DEPRESSION, SO AS BAD AS THINGS BECAME, 9 MILLION JOBS LOST, 5 MILLION HOMES LOST, AS BAD AS IT WAS, THERE IS NO TELLING HOW FAR DOWN WE WOULD  HAVE GONE WITHOUT HIS LEADERSHIP. SO WE ARE OUT OF THE DITCH THAT WE WERE IN, AND NOW WE HAVE GOT TO DO EVEN MORE. WE HAVE GOT TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE, 15 MILLION NEW JOBS IN THE LAST 7 1/2  YEARS, 20 MILLION PEOPLE NOW HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE WHO DID NOT HAVE BEFORE HE BECAME PRESIDENT, SO WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE THE WILL AND THE PLANS TOGETHER TO MOVE FORWARD. THAT IS WHY I HAVE PROPOSED A COMPREHENSIVE NEW COMMITMENT TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SERIOUS,  SUSTAINED INVESTMENTS TO CREATE  MORE GOOD-PAYING JOBS, HELP FAMILIES BUILD AND REBUILD WEALTH, TO SUPPORT BLACK AND LATINO-OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES. FOR ME, THESE ARE NOT JUST  ECONOMIC ISSUES.  THEY ARE PART OF A LONG, CONTINUING STRUGGLE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS.  ROSA PARKS OPENED UP EVERYTHING ON THE BUS. NOW, WE HAVE GOT TO EXPAND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES SO EVERYBODY CAN AFFORD THE FARE,  AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BUS ROUTE REACHES EVERY  NEIGHBORHOOD AND CONNECTS FAMILIES WITH SAFE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND GOOD JOBS.   SYLVIA MENDEZ HELPED DESEGREGATE OUR SCHOOLS. NOW WE HAVE GOT TO HELP EVERY FAMILY AFFORD TO BOOKS, COMPUTERS, AND INTERNET ACCESS THAT OUR KIDS NEED TO LEARN IN THE 21ST CENTURY. SO IN MY FIRST 100 DAYS AS PRESIDENT, WE WILL WORK WITH BOTH PARTIES TO PASS THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN NEW, GOOD-PAYING JOBS SINCE WORLD WAR II. THAT INCLUDES JOBS IN MANUFACTURING, CLEAN ENERGY, TECHNOLOGY, INNOVATION, SMALL BUSINESSES, AND INFRASTRUCTURE. IF WE INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE NOW, WE WILL NOT ONLY CREATE JOBS TODAY, WE WILL LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE. YOU ARE GOING TO ALSO FOCUS ON CREATING JOBS IN COMMUNITIES  WHERE UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS SEPARATELY HIGH AFTER  GENERATIONS OF UNDERINVESTMENT  AND NEGLECT. I AM A BIG FAN OF CONGRESSMAN JIM CLYBURN'S 10, 20, 30 PLAN, STEERING 10% OF FEDERAL INVESTMENT TO NEIGHBORHOODS  WHERE 20% OF THE POPULATION HAS BEEN LIVING BELOW THE POVERTY LINE FOR 30 YEARS. WE NEED THAT KIND OF FOCUS, TARGETED INVESTMENT IN URBAN PLACES, WORLD PLACES, WERE EVER AMERICANS HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT AND LEFT BEHIND. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO INVEST $20  BILLION IN CREATING JOBS FOR YOU PEOPLE. THERE'S A BIG GAP HERE. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BETWEEN LATINO AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN  YOUTH IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN FOR WHITES. IT IS HARD TO WRITE A RESUME IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO PUT ON  IT. WE WILL HELP HIM PEOPLE TO GET THAT FIRST JOB, TO GET THAT SECOND JOB, SO THEY CAN BUILD A  GOOD MIDDLE-CLASS LIGHT THAT  WILL GIVE THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES A BETTER FUTURE. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO DO MORE TO HELP BLACK AND LATINO ENTREPRENEURS GET ACCESS TO CAPITAL SO THEY HAVE A REAL CHANCE AT TURNING THEIR IDEAS INTO DRIVING -- THRIVING BUSINESSES. IT IS NOT ONLY GOOD FOR THOSE ENTREPRENEURS. IT IS GOOD FOR THEIR FAMILIES, WORKERS, AND COMMUNITIES. ADDITIONALLY, AS PART OF OUR AND TO AND REFORM OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, WE WILL HELP PEOPLE SUCCEED WHEN THEY RETURN HOME FROM JAIL OR PRISON. WE ARE GOING TO BAN THE BOX SO THEY CAN BE JUDGED BY THEIR SKILLS AND TALENTS, NOT BY THEIR PAST, AND WE WILL DEDICATE FIVE DOLLARS BILLION TO PROVIDE TRAINING AND SUPPORT TO RETURNING CITIZENS SO THEY CAN GET A GOOD-PAYING JOB.  AND IN MY FIRST 100 DAYS, I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP, AS NOT ONLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. EVERY INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS SHOWS IT WILL ADD HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO OUR ECONOMY. IT WILL ALSO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER. WE NEED TO BRING HARD-WORKING PEOPLE OUT OF THE SHADOWS. AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD WORK HARD AND APPLY THEIR  TALENTS TO AMERICAN GROWTH AND  INNOVATION IN PURSUIT OF THEIR OWN DREAMS. WE ARE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET THIS DONE.  WE NEED TO BUILD AN ECONOMY IN THE FUTURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN CAN BE PROUD OF AND BE A PART OF. AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR  EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. THAT WILL BE MY MISSION AS PRESIDENT. THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR PLAN. I HOPE YOU WILL GO TO MY WEBSITE, HILLARYCLINTON.COM TO  READ THE DETAILS, INCLUDING HOW WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING I PROPOSED. AND OF COURSE, I HOPE YOU WILL COMPARE WHAT I AM PROPOSING TO WHAT MY OPPONENT IS TALKING  ABOUT.   I HEAR ONE MEASURE YOU COULD USE FOR THAT COMPARISON. AN INDEPENDENT ECONOMIST RECENTLY CALCULATED THAT IF MY AGENDA FOR JOBS AND GROWTH IS  PUT INTO PLACE, OUR ECONOMY  WOULD CREATE AT LEAST 10.4  MILLION JOBS WITHIN FOUR YEARS. WE ACTUALLY THINK IT COULD BE MORE THAN THAT. NOW, THIS ECONOMIST ALSO RAN THE NUMBERS ON DONALD TRUMP,  INCLUDING HIS DISASTROUS AND INHUMANE PLAN TO ROUND UP AND  DEPORT MILLIONS OF HARD-WORKING IMMIGRANTS. THE RESULT, ACCORDING TO THE ECONOMIC ADVISOR FOR JOHN MCCAIN DURING HIS 2008 RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY, THE RESULT OF TRUMP'S PLANS WOULD BE A LENGTHY RECESSION WITH 3.4 MILLION JOBS LOST. NOW, OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP'S  PROBLEMS GO BEYOND ECONOMICS. AT EVERY TURN, HE STOKES DIVISION AND RESENTMENT. HE SAYS HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT ONE GROUP OF AMERICANS AFTER ANOTHER. HE IS HARKENING BACK TO THE MOST  SHAMEFUL CHAPTERS OF OUR HISTORY  AND APPEALING TO THE UGLIEST IMPULSES OF OUR SOCIETY. YOU KNOW THE LIST. YOU HAVE REPORTED ON IT. HE STARTED THIS CAMPAIGN BY  DESCRIBING MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS AS  CRIMINALS AND RAPISTS. HE RETWEETS WHITE NATIONALISTS. HE SAYS A DISTINGUISHED FEDERAL JUDGE CANNOT BE TRUSTED BECAUSE HE IS OF MEXICAN HERITAGE. HE TALKS ABOUT BANNING MUSLIMS FROM COMING TO THE UNITED STATES, A LAND BUILT ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND, YES, HE ALSO TALKS ABOUT CURTAILING PRESS FREEDOM AS WELL. WE NEED TO STAND OUT AS A COUNTRY AND SAY THAT DONALD  TRUMP DOES NOT REPRESENT WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE BELIEVE. THAT IS WHAT MY CAMPAIGN, WHAT  TIM KAINE AND I AND EVERYONE SUPPORTING US IS DOING EVERY  DAY, AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP AT IT, BECAUSE I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART THAT AMERICA IS BETTER THAN THIS. AMERICA IS BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP. WE JUST LAUNCHED AN ALL-SPANISH TWITTER ACCOUNT BECAUSE WE WANT  TO BRING AS MANY AMERICANS AS  POSSIBLE INTO THIS CONVERSATION. WE HAVE OPENED OFFICES IN EVERY STATE BECAUSE WE WANT TO COMPETE EVERYWHERE. WE WANT TO BRING OUR MESSAGE AND OUR VISION TO ALL CORNERS OF OUR COUNTRY. BUT WE CANNOT DO IT ALONE. EVERYONE, REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT,  AN INDEPENDENT NEEDS TO STAND UP AND SPEAK OUT. I THINK JOURNALISTS HAVE A SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR DEMOCRACY IN A TIME LIKE THIS. AS IDA WELLS SAID, PEOPLE MUST KNOW BEFORE THEY CAN ACT, AND THERE IS NO EDUCATOR TO COMPARE TO THE PRESS. MANY OF YOU ARE SHOWING THE WAY. IT IS A BADGE OF HONOR WHEN JORGE RAMOS GETS THROWN OUT OF A PRESS CONFERENCE FOR CHALLENGING DONALD TRUMP.   OR WHEN AND OTHER NEWS ORGANIZATIONS GET GETS AND FOR REPORTING WHAT HE SAYS. AS JORGE SAID, THE BEST JOURNALISM HAPPENS WHEN YOU TAKE A STAND, WHEN YOU DO NOT  JUSTICE. I HOPE YOU WILL KEEP CALLING IT LIKE YOU SEE IT. KEEP HOLDING US ALL ACCOUNTABLE.  I HAVE LAID OUT ALL THESE PLANS, AND I AM WELL AWARE THAT I HAVE BEEN SOMETIMES MADE FUN OF FOR PUTTING OUT THESE PLANS ABOUT  THE ECONOMY AND EDUCATION AND  CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND HEALTH CARE AND GUN SAFETY MEASURES AND ALL THE REST OF IT. BUT I DO HAVE THIS OLD-FASHIONED IDEA, WHEN YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT, YOU OUGHT TO TELL THE VOTERS OF AMERICA WHAT YOU WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT. SO I'M GOING TO KEEP TELLING YOU  WHAT I WOULD DO BECAUSE I WHAT YOU TO HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE,  PRESS AND CITIZENS ALIKE. BECAUSE THE STAKES ARE AS HIGH AS THEY HAVE EVER BEEN IN OUR LIFETIME. AND WE ALL HAVE TO DO OUR PART. SO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DO EVERY DAY. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS.  THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.   A GREAT QUESTION AND ONE THAT I HAVE GIVEN MUCH THOUGHT TO, BECAUSE I AM DETERMINED THAT WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP. HERE IS HOW I SEE IT.  WE ARE GOING TO START IMMEDIATELY. I WANT THIS TO BE A CLEAR HIGH PRIORITY FOR MY ADMINISTRATION. WE WILL BE PREPARED TO INTRODUCE AS EFFICIENT AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN DO SO. I AM HOPING THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION, WHICH I AM WORKING HARD TO ENSURE A VICTORY, WILL SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE TO OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS THAT IT IS TIME FOR THEM TO QUIT STANDING IN THE WAY OF IMMIGRATION REFORM. IF YOU REMEMBER, AFTER THE 2012 ELECTION, THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE DID WHAT THEY CALL AN AUTOPSY OF THEIR LOSS  AND CONCLUDED THAT THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE TO DENY THE IMPORTANCE OF IMMIGRATION REFORM, AND THEY URGED REPUBLICANS RUNNING FOR OFFICE TO GET ON BOARD. NOW, THAT HAS NOT TURNED OUT THE WAY THAT THEY SEEMED TO HAVE HOPED. WE HAVE INSTEAD A REPUBLICAN NOMINEE WHO HAS BEEN VERY ELDERLY -- VIRULENTLY AND THE IMMIGRANT. WE HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF HAVING A DEMOCRATIC SENATE IF EVERYBODY DOES I WOULD HOPE THEY WOULD DO AND VOTE FOR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES FOR THE SENATE. I BELIEVE WE WILL PICK UP SOME SEATS IN THE HOUSE AND AT LEAST IF NOT TAKE IT BACK, NARROW THE  NUMBERS. IF WE MOVE IN THE SENATE AND THEN WE DEMAND THAT THERE BE A VOTE IN THE HOUSE, BECAUSE I AM CONVINCED THAT IF THE BIPARTISAN BILL THAT HAD BEEN ACHIEVED IN THE SENATE -- REMEMBER, WHEN MARCO RUBIO WAS FOR IT AND PEOPLE WORKED HARD AND ACHIEVED IT -- IF IT HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO COME FOR A VOTE IN THE HOUSE, IT WOULD HAVE PASSED. SO I VIEW THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE AS INCREASINGLY FAVORABLE TO US MAKING THIS HAPPEN. I WILL ALSO DEFEND THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ACTIONS. I LIKE YOU WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH  THE SUPREME COURT DECISION, BUT REMEMBER WHAT HE DID -- 8% -- IT DID -- IT SENT BACK THE CASE TO BE TRIED. SO DACA AND DAPA ARE STILL ALIVE. TRUMP HAS SAID ONE OF HIS FIRST ACTS OF PRESIDENT WOULD BE TO ELIMINATE EVERY EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SIDE, INCLUDING THOSE ON IMMIGRATION ISSUES. SO I WILL DEFEND DACA AND DAPA WHILE I WORK VIGOROUSLY FOR  IMMIGRATION FOUR. I AM PROPOSING AND OFFICE OF IMMIGRATION REFORM FOR THE WHITE HOUSE SO WE ARE ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND PROVIDE INFORMATION AND HELP PEOPLE. I WILL TAKE A VERY HARD LOOK AT THE DEPORTATION PRIORITIES. MY PRIORITY ARE VIOLENT  CRIMINALS, PEOPLE'S ASSESSMENT OF TERRORISM, NOT HARD-WORKING MOTHERS AND FATHERS AND PEOPLE WHO GO TO WORK, HELP SUPPORT  THIS ECONOMY, PAYING $12 BILLION A YEAR INTO SOCIAL SECURITY SO WE WILL TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THAT. WE WILL CLOSE PRIVATE DETENTION CENTERS JUST LIKE I WANT TO END OF PRIVATE PRISONS. WE ARE GOING TO CLOSE PRIVATE  DETENTION CENTERS. SO I HAVE A VERY ACTIVE AGENDA, AND WE ARE GOING TO BE THE ON IT, AND I BELIEVE, AND OBVIOUSLY IT DEPENDS UPON THE OUTCOME OF  THIS ELECTION, WHICH IS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO REGISTER MORE PHOTOS.  MY CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO  REGISTER 3 MILLION MORE VOTERS, AND ITS PEOPLE TO TURN OUT, BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO START  EARLY AND WE ARE GOING TO BE  TENACIOUS AND ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO GETTING A POSITIVE  RESULT. AND I THINK THE CHANCES ONCE WE WIN WILL IMPROVE DRAMATICALLY.  I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS COMMITTED TO IMMIGRATION REFORM. IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE GOT A BIPARTISAN TILL PAST INSED IN THE SENATE. WHAT WE DID NOT GET WAS ENOUGH POLITICAL PRESSURE TO TURN THAT BILL IN TO A VOTING ISSUE IN THE 2010 MIDTERM ELECTIONS. HERE IS ONE OF MY FRUSTRATIONS. PEOPLE TURN OUT TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN AND THEN OFTEN DO NOT FOR MIDTERM ELECTIONS. SO WE LOST --   WE LOST A LOT OF LEVERAGE BECAUSE WE LOST THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. SO NOTHING HAPPENS EASILY OR QUICKLY, AND MODERN POLITICS IN AMERICA, BUT AS I HAVE SAID, WE  ARE NOT GOING TO BE DEPORTING HARD-WORKING PEOPLE AND BREAK UP FAMILIES.  I HAVE BEEN ON RECORD FOR A YEAR AND A HALF ABOUT THIS, AND THAT HE HOW I DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT  OF HOMELAND SECURITY TO ACT. WE ARE TO PUSH ON IMMIGRATION REFORM, AND I WILL NEED NOT ONLY A CONSIDERABLE VOTE IN NOVEMBER, BUT I WILL NEED PEOPLE ACROSS OUR COUNTRY TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR HOW THEY ARE GOING TO ACT ON  IMMIGRATION REFORM. IF WE PUT ENOUGH ORGANIZING AND POLITICAL EFFORT INTO THIS, I AM OPTIMISTIC. CAN I BELIEVE WE CAN GET THIS DONE. BUT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE WE WANT.  AND I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I WILL GIVE YOU MY VERY BEST EFFORT AND  I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO HELP ELECT A DEMOCRATIC SENATE,  AND I HAVE ALREADY TALKED TO SOME OF MY FORMER COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE. THIS WILL BE FAST TRACKED. WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT CAN BE PASSED IN THE SENATE BECAUSE IT HAPPENED A FEW YEARS AGO. IF WE PUT ENOUGH PRESSURE ON THE  HOUSE AND DO EVERYTHING TO REALLY FORCE THEM TO HAVE TO TAKE WHAT THE SENATE PASSES, I  THINK THE OUTCOME WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT THIS TIME. AND THAT IS MY GOAL, AND THAT'S  WHAT I AM GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO ACHIEVE.  I APPRECIATE YOUR ASKING THAT, BECAUSE I WAS POINTING OUT IN BOTH OF THOSE INSTANCES THAT THE DIRECTOR HAD SAID THAT MY ANSWERS IN MY FBI INTERVIEW WORTH TRUTHFUL. -- WERE TRUTHFUL. THAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE HERE. I HAVE SAID DURING THE INTERVIEW AND MANY OTHER OCCASIONS OVER THE PAST MONTHS THAT WHAT I TOLD THE FBI, WHICH HE SAID WAS TRUTHFUL, IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT I HAVE SAID PUBLICLY. SO I MAY HAVE SHORT-CIRCUITED,  AND FOR THAT I WILL TRY TO CLARIFY, BECAUSE I THINK CHRIS WALLACE AND I WERE TALKING PAST EACH OTHER BECAUSE, OF COURSE,  HE COULD ONLY TALK TO WHAT I HAD TOLD THE FBI, AND I APPRECIATED THAT.  I HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED REPEATEDLY THAT USING TWO E-MAIL ACCOUNTS WAS A MISTAKE, AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. BUT I DO THINK HAVING HIM SAY THAT MY ANSWERS TO THE FBI WERE TRUTHFUL, AND THAT I SHOULD QUICKLY ADD WHAT I SAID WAS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT I HAD SAID PUBLICLY, AND THAT IS REALLY SORT OF IN MY VIEW TRYING TO TIE BOTH ENDS TOGETHER.  THERE THE FACTS  BEHIND THAT AS WELL. YOU KNOW THAT I SENT OVER 30,000 E-MAILS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT THAT WERE WORK RELATED E-MAILS. DIRECTOR COMEY SAID THAT ONLY THREE OUT OF 30,000 HAD ANYTHING RESEMBLING CLASSIFIED MARKERS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? USUALLY, IF ANY OF YOU HAVE EVER SERVED IN THE GOVERNMENT, A  CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT HAS A BIG  HEADING ON THE TOP, WHICH MAKES VERY CLEAR WHAT THE CLASSIFICATION IS. AND IN QUESTIONING, DIRECTOR COMEY MADE THE POINT THAT THE  THREE E-MAILS OUT OF THE 30,000  DID NOT HAVE THE APPROPRIATE MARKINGS, AND IT WAS, THEREFORE, REASONABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT ANYONE, INCLUDING MYSELF, WOULD HAVE NOT SUSPECTED THAT THEY WERE CLASSIFIED. AND IN FACT, I THINK THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED BY OTHERS WHO HAD SAID TWO OUT OF THOSE THREE WERE LATER EXPLAINED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT NOT TO HAVE BEEN IN ANY WAY CONFIDENTIAL AT THE TIME THAT THEY WERE DELIVERED. SO THAT LEAVES BELT 100 OUT OF 30,000 E-MAILS -- THAT LEAVES THE 100 OUT OF 30,000 E-MAILS THAT DIRECTOR COMEY TESTIFIED, CONTAINED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THERE WERE NO MARKINGS ON THOSE 100 E-MAILS. WHAT WE HAD IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE YEAR, AND THAT IS I NEVER SENT OR RECEIVED ANYTHING  THAT WAS MARKED ""CLASSIFIED."" NOW, IF IN RETROSPECT, WHICH IS  WHAT IS BEHIND THE 100 NUMBER,  IT IN RETROSPECT SOME DIFFERENT AGENCIES SAID, BUT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN, ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN, THAT IS  WHAT THE DEBATE IS ABOUT. BUT DIRECTOR COMEY SAID THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO INTENTION ON MY PART TO EITHER IGNORE OR IN ANY WAY DISMISSED THE IMPORTANCE -- DISMISS THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE DOCUMENTS, BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT MARKED CLASSIFIED.  THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD TO DO. I WILL GO BACK TO WHERE I STARTED. I REGRET USING ONE ACCOUNT. I HAVE TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. WHAT I AM PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO CLARIFY AND EXPLAIN WHAT I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS ON THIS.  I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF HOURS WITH MR. MORELLE. HE IS A CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONAL WHO HAS DEDICATED HIS ENTIRE CAREER TO PROTECTING OUR COUNTRY. I WAS HONORED TO RECEIVE HIS ENDORSEMENT.  I WILL LET HIS COMMENTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES, BUT I REALLY APPRECIATED HIS EXPLAINING AS HE DID IN HIS OP-ED SOME OF WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION.  I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE CORE OF HIS SUPPORT -- I AM NOT GOING TO SPEAK FOR  EVERYONE WHO SUPPORTS HIM BECAUSE I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN SOME QUITE DISTRESSING  STATEMENTS COMING OUT OF HIS RALLIES AND HIS SUPPORTERS. BUT I THINK THE CORE OF HIS SUPPORT REALLY CENTERS ON THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE ECONOMY THAT SO MANY AMERICANS FEEL. AND WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING IS, YOU KNOW, I AM GOING TO BRING THIS COUNTRY GET IT, I THINK WE  HAVE THREE OVERARCHING GOALS. WE NEED MORE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY, TO PROTECT OUR  NATIONAL SECURITY, AND WE HAVE GOT TO WORK TOWARD AMERICAN  UNITY. SO I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT HAS DRIVEN PEOPLE TO SUPPORT T RUMP. AND I HAVE MET WITH SOME PEOPLE, LISTENS TO THEM, AND SO MANY OF THEM ARE LOOKING FOR AN  EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THEY LOST THE JOB THEY HAD FOR 18 YEARS IN THE FACTORY CLOSED AND NOBODY CARED ABOUT THEM. WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO WHEN  THEIR WHOLE LIFE WAS SPENT MINING COAL AND THEY MAY $80,000 A YEAR, NOW THEY CAN BARELY FIND  A JOB MAKING MINIMUM WAGE, WHY DISSENTERS OF SO MANY OLD INDUSTRIAL -- WHY THE CENTERS OF SO MANY INDUSTRIAL TOWNS IN AMERICA ARE HOLLOWED OUT AND  PEOPLE ARE TURNING TO OPIATES AND HEROINE. AND THE LIST GOES ON. I THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE OF COURSE SOME OF THE APPEAL IS XENOPHOBIA AND RACIST AND MISOGYNISTIC AND OFFENSIVE. WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. BUT LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE REAL PAIN OF MANY AMERICANS ARE FEELING BECAUSE THE ECONOMY HAS LEFT THEM BEHIND. SO I HAVE SAID -- I SAID IT AGAIN IN MY ACCEPTANCE SPEECH LAST THURSDAY -- I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT FOR ALL AMERICANS. I WANT TO LIFT UP AND GIVE EVERYBODY A CHANCE TO PURSUE THEIR DREAMS. AND THAT MEANS PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING HIM.  WHEN I WENT TO WEST VIRGINIA, I  KNEW I WAS NOT GOING TO WIN WEST  VIRGINIA. I CAN TELL YOU  AND I WAS IN A MEETING WITH A GROUP OF FOLKS, INCLUDING A COAL MINER WHO WAS INCREDIBLY EMOTIONAL AND TALKING TO ME. AN OUTSIDE THERE WAS A BIG TRUMP PROTESTS GOING ON, AND ONE OF THE PEOPLE AT THE PROTEST, OR GOODNESS SAKES, WAS BLANKENSHIP, WHO HAD JUST BEEN  CONVICTED OF RECKLESS INDIFFERENCE TOWARD THE WELL-BEING OF HIS COAL MINERS, CAUSING DEATH. SO CLEARLY THE LINES ARE PRETTY STARK. BUT I HAVE SAID I HAVE A PLAN FOR COAL COUNTRY, A PLAN FOR INDIAN COUNTRY, A PLAN FOR INNER CITIES, A PLAN FOR WORLD  COMMUNITIES. IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS I SAID IN MY REMARKS THAT I SUPPORT JIM CLYBURN'S PROPOSAL, WHICH WOULD HELP YOU IN ALL COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE TO REJECT AND STAND UP AGAINST THE APPEALS TO THE KIND OF BIGOTRY AND THE USE OF BLUSTER AND BELIEVE THAT WE SEE COMING FROM TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN. BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THE REAL ECONOMIC CHALLENGES THAT TOO MANY AMERICANS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS ARE FACING TODAY. SO THAT IS HOW I THINK ABOUT IT,  AND THAT IS HOW I AM GOING TO  TRY IN THIS CAMPAIGN TO RESPOND TO AND REBUKE ALL OF THE HERBAL THINGS HE SAYS ON A PRETTY  REGULAR BASIS, BUT NOT ABOUT ME. I CAN CARE LESS ABOUT THAT. BUT WHEN HE GOES AFTER INDIVIDUALS, WHEN HE ACCUSES A DISTINGUISHED FEDERAL JUDGE OF MEXICAN HERITAGE OF NOT BEING FAIR, WHEN HE INSULTS A GOLD STAR FAMILY, A MUSLIM-AMERICAN WHO SERVED IN THE LEG -- THE MILITARY, I WILL CALL HIM OUT ON THAT, BUT I WILL ALSO KEEP REACHING OUT TO ALL AMERICANS OF RACES AND ETHNICITIES AND  WHEREVER THEY LIVE TO TELL THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO FORGET ABOUT THEM AFTER THIS ELECTION. I AM GOING TO WORK MY HEART OUT TO HELP EVERYTHING PERSON OF A BETTER JOB WITH A RISING INCOME AND MAKE SURE THEIR KIDS GET A GOOD EDUCATION AND EVERYTHING  ELSE THAT I THINK THEY ARE OWED HERE IN AMERICAN.   LET ME START BY SAYING EVERY TIME I HAVE DONE A JOB, PEOPLE HAVE COUNTED ON ME AND TRUSTED ME, AND AT THE CONVENTION LAST WEEK WE HIGHLIGHTED THE FIGHT OF MY LIFE STARTING AS A LAWYER FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND, TAKING ON THE PROBLEM OF JUVENILES IN ADULT JAILS IN SOUTH CAROLINA, SEGREGATING ACADEMIES IN ALABAMA, FIGHTING FOR KIDS WITH KIDS TO GET AN EDUCATION. EVERY THING I DID AFTER 9/11 AND REPRESENTING U.S. SECRETARY OF  STATE. I THINK THIS SERIOUSLY. I THINK THIS SERIOUS.  IT DOES NOT MAKE ME FEEL GOOD  WHEN PEOPLE SAY THOSE THINGS, AND I RECOGNIZE I HAVE WORK TO DO. WHEN I STARTED RUNNING FOR THE SENATE IN NEW YORK, A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS WERE SAID. I WON, I WORKED HARD FOR THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK, AND I WAS REELECTED WITH 67% OF THE VOTE,  WHEN I DEMONSTRATED I WOULD FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE I RESENTED. I RAN A CARD CAMPAIGN AND AGAINST BARACK OBAMA, AS EVERYBODY REMEMBERS.  IT GOT A LITTLE CONTENTIOUS FROM  TIME TO TIME. TO MY SURPRISE HIM HE TURNED AROUND AND ASKED ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE BECAUSE HE  TRUSTED ME, AND I SERVED. AND WHEN I LEFT I HAD A 66% APPROVAL RATING. SO ASK  WERE 67% OF THE PEOPLE IN NEW YORK WRONG? OR MAYBE JUST MAYBE, WHEN I'M ACTUALLY RUNNING FOR A JOB, THERE IS A REAL BENEFIT TO THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE IN TRYING TO STIR UP AS MUCH CONCERN AS POSSIBLE? SO I THINK IT SERIOUSLY, AND I WILL WORK MY HEART OUT IN PAIN  AND AS PRESIDENT TO PRODUCE RESULTS FOR PEOPLE, TO GET THE ECONOMY TO WORK FOR EVERYBODY,  NOT JUST THOSE OF THE TOP,  PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT VOTE FOR ME, BECAUSE I THINK OUR COUNTRY IS AT A CROSSROADS ELECTION. PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID IT EXTREMELY WELL, BOTH IN WHAT HIS SPEECH DISCUSSED IN THE CONVENTION, WHAT HIS PRESS CONFERENCES SINCE HAVE POINTED OUT.  THIS IS A CROSSROADS. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. YOU CAN LOOK AT MY RECORD OF  PUBLIC SERVICE. YOU CAN MEET PEOPLE IN FAMILIES WHO HAVE BENEFITED BY THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM. YOU CAN MEET PEOPLE WHO HAVE BENEFITED BY THE THE FOSTER CARE ADOPTION SYSTEM.  YOU CAN MEET FIRST FUNDERS AND SURVIVORS FROM 9/11 WHO WERE BENEFITED BECAUSE I WENT TO BAT FOR THEM. YOU CAN MEET NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS AND THE FAMILIES WHO DID  NOT HAVE HEALTH CARE UNLESS  THEY WERE DEPLOYED UNLESS I WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS TO HELP FIX THAT. YOU CAN GO DOWN A LONG LIST. WHAT I HAVE DONE IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT PUBLIC SERVICE, AND I HAVE PROUD I HAVE HAD THE GREAT,  GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON BEHALF OF GIVING MORE PEOPLE A BETTER LIFE EVER SINCE I WAS RIGHT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL. SO I'M JUST GOING TO GET UP EVERY DAY AND MAKE MY CASE, AND I THINK THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY HEAR IT.  OH, MY GOSH. COULD I TELL YOU I AM BLESSED A CREW OF GREAT FRIENDS --   AND I HAVE HAD TWO  CHIEFS OF STAFF WHO ARE MY AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN FRIENDS. I HAVE BEEN BLESSED TO HAVE PEOPLE BY MY SIDE IN POLITICS,  LIKE ONE OF THE LEADERS OF MY CAMPAIGN. I HAVE HAD A GREAT GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO I HAVE BEEN REALLY MOTIVATED BY AND FRANKLY LEARNED FROM. SO I REALLY HAVE HAD A LIFETIME OF FRIENDSHIP GOING BACK TO MY COLLEGE YEARS.  ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS WAS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDENT.  SO I CANNOT COMPRESS INTO ONE CONVERSATION. THEY HAVE SUPPORTED ME, THEY HAVE CHASTISED ME, THEY HAD RAISED ISSUES WITH ME, THEY  TRIED TO EXPAND MY MUSICAL TASTES --     SO WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF GREAT, GREAT TIMES  BECAUSE OF OUR FRIENDSHIPS. SO I CANNOT REALLY TAKE ONE CONVERSATION OUT OF 50 YEARS OF CONVERSATIONS. AND I DO NOT WANT TO EMBARRASS MY FRIENDS. TAKING LEWIS IS HERE. SHE JUST BECAME -- PEGGY LEWIS IS HERE. SHE JUST BECAME THE DEAN OF COMMUNICATIONS. ANOTHER IS AN ACTING CHAIR OF THE DNC --DONNA BRAZILE. I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT. I'M GOING TO RESPECT THE CONE OF FRENCH OF FRIENDSHIP SILENCE,  BUT PLEASE KNOW I HAVE A LOT OF GREAT FRIENDS WHO HAVE GIVEN ME SO MUCH MORE.  I TAKEN SERIOUSLY BECAUSE I HAVE HAD THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF WORKING FOR MANY YEARS WITH LATINO LEADERS, ACTIVISTS, BUSINESSMEN AND WOMEN, JUST AS I RESPONDED TO THE QUESTION. MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WORKING ON BEHALF OF LATINOS WAS -- WELL, ACTUALLY, BEFORE I WAS A LEGAL SERVICES LAWYER, THROUGH MY CHURCH, I THINK HE SAT LATINA -- I BABYSAT LATINO KIDS WHILE THEIR PARENTS WENT TO THE FIELD OUTSIDE MY HOME IN CHICAGO WHICH USED TO BE, HARD TO BELIEVE NOW, MILES OF FARMLAND. IT WAS MY FIRST REAL LESSON IN HOW MUCH MORE WE HAVE IN COMMON. THERE I WAS, 11 OR 12,  BABYSITTING THESE LITTLE KIDS. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE OLD RAMSHACKLE BUS STOP AT THE END OF THE ROAD, AND THE PARENTS AND THE OLDER BROTHERS AND SISTER GOT OUT, AND THESE LITTLE KIDS  BROKE LOOSE AND STARTED RUNNING DOWN THEIR RIGHTS WITH THEIR ARMS OUTSTRETCHED, CALLING FOR  THEIR MOTHERS AND THEIR FATHERS AND GETTING SWEPT UP IN VERY TIRED ARMS. AND THEN WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BIT OLDER, MY CHURCH ARRANGED EXCHANGES WITH LATINO CHURCHES.  WE WOULD GO INTO THE CITY OF CHICAGO, SIT IN CHURCH  BASEMENTS, TALK ABOUT OUR LIVES HIM AND IT REINFORCED WHAT TO ME WAS SO MUCH OF A COMMON SENSE OF  WHAT WE WANTED IN OUR LIVES EVEN THOUGH THEIR LIVES AND MINE WERE VERY DIFFERENT. AS A LEGAL SERVICES LAWYER, AS THE CHAIR OF THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION, WE EXPANDED LEGAL SERVICES INTO PLACES AGAINST A OF POLITICAL OPPOSITION. SO I FEEL VERY FORTUNATE THAT I HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO WORK WITH AND LEARN FROM SO MANY LATINAS AND LATINOS ACROSS AMERICA. WHEN I RAN FOR THE SENATE, I  WORKED CLOSELY WITH OUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES, BOTH AT THE CITY, STATE, AND NATIONAL LEVEL. I WAS HONORED THAT THEY RALLIED AROUND TO SUPPORT ME AND WERE PART OF THE GREAT VICTORY THAT  WE HAD IN THE PRIMARY IN NEW YORK. SO, NO, I DO NOT TAKE ANY VOTER  FOR GRANTED, AND I PARTICULARLY DON'T TAKE ANY VOTER WHO IS PLACING THEIR TRUST AND  CONFIDENCE IN ME FOR GRANTED. BECAUSE I'M GOING TO GET UP AS I SAID EVERY SINGLE DAY AND WORK MY HEART OUT TO GET THE RESULTS THAT I HAVE TOLD YOU WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE TOGETHER. AND I KNOW IT IS HARD. I HAVE BEEN AROUND, AS YOU ALL KNOW VERY WELL. I AM NOT NEW TO THIS. IT DOES NOT HAPPEN BY HOPING IT HAPPENS OR WISHING IT HAPPENS. IT HAPPENS BY DOING EVERYTHING YOU CAN POSSIBLY CAN, AND I AM BLESSED TO HAVE SUCH CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS AND FRIENDSHIPS WITH LATINO LEADERS TONIGHT -- LEADERS.  TONIGHT AT MY HOUSE WE WILL BE HAVING A BIG EVENT WITH LATINO BUSINESS LEADERS FROM AROUND AMERICA. SO I AM GOING TO DO WHAT I HAVE  ALWAYS DONE. I THINK A CORE OF POLITICAL  LEADERSHIP IS RELATIONSHIP. YOU HAVE TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH INDIVIDUALS AND  COMMUNITIES. I KNOW THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN BY JUST ASKING FOR IT. IT HAPPENS BECAUSE YOU WORK HARD TO ACHIEVE IT. SO I AM GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY LATINO VOTER WHO VOTES FOR ME KNOWS THAT I AM GOING TO BE DOING MY BEST TO DELIVER ON EVERY THING THAT I HAVE SAID, AND I WILL TELL YOU, AS WE GO ALONG, WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE BECAUSE I'M A  DISASTER HELP. I MAY NEED YOU TO PUT PRESSURE ON ELECTED OFFICIALS. I MAY NEED YOU TO FLOOD THE INTERNET OR THE OLD-FASHIONED  MAILBOXES OF ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES SO THEY KNOW PEOPLE ARE WATCHING. THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO GET IT DONE. I AM PRETTY CONFIDENT AND OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THAT. SO I HOPE THAT PEOPLE WILL TAKE THIS ELECTION SERIOUSLY BECAUSE I SURE TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY, AND  TOGETHER I THINK WE CAN CREATE  THE KIND OF FUTURE THAT EVERYONE OF OUR KIDS AND -- EVERY ONE OF  OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS DESERVE.","Hillary Clinton Remarks in Washington, D.C."

ANYONE OF THOSE THINGS IS SO OFFENSIVE, AND THEN TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK AS HE DID ON THE CAPTAIN'S MOTHER, A GOLD STAR MOTHER WHO STILL THERE ON THAT STAGE WITH HER HUSBAND, HONORING THE SACRIFICE OF THEIR SON AND WHO HAD IN THE DAYS SINCE, SPOKEN UP ABOUT THE OVERWHELMING EMOTION ANYBODY WOULD FEEL AS HER SON WAS BEING HONORED, AND THEN TO HAVE TRUMP DO WHAT HE DID, I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THE BOTTOM IS.  I DO NOT KNOW. WE HAVE REACHED OUT AND I SPOKE ABOUT THE CATS IN MANY MONTHS AGO AND I WAS AWARE AND I DID IT AT THE TIME BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S CONTINUING, OFFENSIVE REMARKS  ABOUT AMERICAN MUSLIMS, MUSLIMS AROUND THE WORLD, WHICH I THOUGHT WERE SO INAPPROPRIATE. TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE THE CAPTAIN , A BRAVE AMERICAN MUSLIM, SERVING OUR COUNTRY ON BEING IN EFFECT LOOKED IN TO ALL OF TRUMP'S RICHLY ALL, THERE IS NO  WAY I COULD MATCH THE ELOQUENCE.  I THINK THIS IS THE TIME TO PICK COUNTRY OVER PARTY. A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID THAT. WE HAVE REPUBLICANS AT OUR CONVENTION, REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE ANALYZED HIS BEHAVIOR AND HIS RHETORIC IN THE CAMPAIGN AND  HAVE MADE IT VERY CLEAR.  I THINK THE UPROAR FROM AMERICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN RESPONSE TO A NUMBER OF COMMENTS TRUMP HAS MADE, IN PARTICULAR TO HIS DEROGATORY COMMENTS, IT SHOWS TO THE CONTRARY THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE DECENT, CARING, LOOKING FOR WAYS TO COME TOGETHER AND NOT BE DIVIDED BY FEAR AND HATRED.   LET ME SAY THIS. THIS CAME UP FOR THE FIRST TIME, I SAW IT, TODAY. A NONPARTISAN, INDEPENDENT COMMISSION THAT SETS OF THE  DEBATES. I WAS TOLD THEY SET UP A SCHEDULE LAST FALL. WHO KNEW, WE DO NOT KNOW WHO THE  NOMINEES WOULD BE. I WILL BEAT HIM.","Hillary Clinton Speaks to Reporters in Ashland, Ohio"

I AM SO HAPPY TO BE HERE ON THIS ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS, BEAUTIFUL ALL MILE AFTERNOON. -- OHIO AFTERNOON. AND I'M SO GLAD TO BE MAKING THIS JOURNEY WITH SENATOR TIM KAINE AND AND HOLDEN -- ANN HOLDEN BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT PUBLIC SERVICE IS ALL ABOUT. THEY ARE COMMITTED TO DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN. AND TIM HAS, STARTING ON CITY COUNCIL, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND NOW SENATOR, TO GIVE PEOPLE THE BEST CHANCE THEY CAN TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. PLEASE JOIN ME AGAIN AND THANKING SENATOR TIM KAINE.   AND MAYOR, WE ARE HAPPY TO BE HERE IN YOUR BEAUTIFUL CAPITAL CITY HERE IN COLUMBUS. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FELT, BUT BOY, I THOUGHT YOUR CONGRESSWOMAN REALLY KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK AT THE CONVENTION. I HAVE NOT EVEN HAD TIME TO TELL JOYCE THIS, BUT IT THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ON THE VERY FIRST NIGHT. SHE WAS SITTING IN THE BOX WITH MY HUSBAND, SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. ALL OF A SUDDEN TWITTER WAS GOING CRAZY. WHO IS THAT BEAUTIFUL, WELL-DRESSED ELEGANT WOMAN SITTING NEXT TO BILL CLINTON? AND FINALLY SOMEBODY SAID, THAT IS THE CONGRESSWOMAN FROM OHIO. AND I WAS SO PROUD TO HAVE HER SUPPORT. NOW, THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE WITH US. SOMEBODY VERY SPECIAL TO US. SOMEBODY SPECIAL TO OHIO. YOUR FORMER GOVERNOR, TED STRICKLAND.   I HAVE AT THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF KNOWING TED FOR DECADES. I HAVE SEEN HOW HARD HE HAS WORKED. HE GOT DEALT A BAD HAND BEING GOVERNOR DURING THE REPUBLICAN GENERATED GREAT RECESSION AND DOING EVERYTHING HE COULD TO TRY TO HELP OHIOANS GET THROUGH THAT. NOW HE IS RUNNING TO REPRESENT YOU IN THE SENATE. I THINK YOUR OTHER GREAT SENATOR , SHERROD BROWN, DESERVES A PARTNER.   EVERY TIME SHERROD STANDS UP AND FIGHT FOR YOU, HE NEEDS A PARTNER TO DO THE SAME AND NOT HAVE HIS VOTE CANCELED OUT. SO, DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO SEND TED STRICKLAND TO THE SENATE IN NOVEMBER.   TIM IS RIGHT, WE HAVE HAD A GREAT TIME. HOW MANY OF YOU WATCHED THE CONVENTION?   I WAS SO PROUD TO SEE DEMOCRATS STANDING UP AND SPEAKING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THE ECONOMY WORKS FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. TAKING ON THE SPECIAL INTERESTS THAT HAVE BENEFITED FROM A SYSTEM THAT IS RATE IN THEIR FAVOR. SO -- THAT IS RIGGED IN THEIR FAVOR. I WAS THRILLED TO GET ON THAT BUS IN PHILADELPHIA AND HAD OUT ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA AND INTO OHIO. AND ALONG THE WAY, WE STOPPED AT FACTORIES WHERE HARD-WORKING AMERICANS ARE STILL MAKING THINGS. WE STOPPED AT A FACTORY IN JOHNSTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA WHERE BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT WORKS WITH THE STEELWORKERS OF THEIR REPRESENTED BY THEIR UNION, FIGHTING HARD TO HAVE MORE GOOD JOBS. THEY TOLD ME HOW THEY ARE BRINGING JOBS BACK FROM CHINA, HOW THEY ARE CREATING MORE OPPORTUNITY. THAT IS THE AMERICAN STORY THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE TELLING DURING THIS CAMPAIGN, DURING THE LAST 100 DAYS. I HAVE SPECIFIC PLANS ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO GET THE ECONOMY WORKING AGAIN FOR EVERYBODY. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN NEW JOBS SINCE WORLD WAR II AND PUT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO WORK.   AND HERE IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT -- WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE. OUR ROADS, TUNNELS, AIRPORTS, WATER SYSTEMS. BUT NOT JUST WHAT YOU CAN PHYSICALLY SEE, WE NEED A NEW ELECTRIC GREAT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE AND DISTRIBUTE ALL THE CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY WE ARE GOING TO BE PRODUCING.   AND WE NEED TO FINISH THE JOB OF CONNECTING EVERY HOME AND BUSINESS IN AMERICA TO HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS.   I TALK A LOT ABOUT BUILDING OUR ECONOMY, GETTING JOBS FOR EVERYONE. WELL, IT IS A LITTLE HEARTBREAKING TO LEARN, AS I DID WHEN I WAS TALKING TO SOME TEACHERS A FEW DAYS AGO -- AND I LOVE TEACHERS.   AND THE TEACHERS TOLD ME THEY HAD JUST HAD A NATIONAL SURVEY DONE AND LEARNED THAT 70% OF THE TEACHERS IN AMERICA ASSIGNED HOMEWORK TO THE STUDENTS THAT REQUIRE KIDS TO GO ON THE INTERNET. THAT MAKES SENSE, WE ARE LIVING IN THE INFORMATION AGE, WE WANT MORE PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE COME UP TO HELP CREATE THAT FUTURE SO WE HAVE EVEN MORE OPPORTUNITIES. BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM -- 5 MILLION KIDS IN AMERICA DO NOT HAVE ACCESS AT HOME TO HIGH-SPEED INTERNET. ALREADY THEY ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND. SO, WE HAVE TO BUILD AMERICA'S COMPETITION, BUILD AMERICA'S OPPORTUNITIES, AND THE PLANS WE HAVE LAID OUT WILL DO JUST THAT. I ALSO BELIEVE WE NEED TO DO MORE FOR SMALL BUSINESS. 98% OF THE BUSINESSES IN OHIO ARE SMALL BUSINESSES.   LET'S HAVE GREATER ACCESS TO CREDIT. LET'S BE SURE WE CUT THROUGH AND ELIMINATE ANY OF THE RED TAPE AND ANY OTHER OBSTACLES. YOU HEARD TIM SAY HIS DAD RAN A SMALL BUSINESS, SO DID MINE. MY FATHER RAN IT PRINT PLANT -- A PRINT PLANT. I WAS THERE HELPING HIM, BUT I KNOW HOW HARD HE WORKED. AND I AM PERSONALLY SICKENED WHEN I HEAR THE STORIES ABOUT DONALD TRUMP REFUSING TO PAY PLUMBERS AND PAINTERS AND MARBLE INSTALLERS AND GLASS INSTALLERS, AND SMALL BUSINESSES WHO HAVE DONE THE WORK. I THINK ABOUT MY DAD, HE WORKED HARD -- WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THE CUSTOMERS HE HAD, AFTER HE PRINTED THOSE DRAPERY FABRICS, MADE THEM INTO DRAPES, LOADED THEM INTO HIS CAR, DELIVERED THEM, HELPED INSTALL THEM, AND SOMEBODY LIKE DONALD TRUMP SAID WE ARE NOT PAYING YOU. MY DAD WOULD HAVE SAID, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I DID WHEN I WAS CONTRACTED TO DO. BUT THE PERSON AFTER PERSON AND BUSINESS AFTER BUSINESS, DONALD TRUMP SAID, I DO NOT CARE. IT IS NOT BECAUSE HE COULD NOT PAY, HE WOULD NOT PAY THEM. HE DROVE A BUSINESSES INTO BANKRUPTCY. IN ADDITION TO TAKING BANKRUPTCY HIMSELF, SIX TIMES. MY FRIENDS, THAT IS NOT HOW WE DO BUSINESS IN AMERICA. IF YOU DO THE WORK, YOU DESERVE THE PAY. AND WE ARE GOING TO STAND UP AND MAKE THAT CASE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. THE OTHER THING ABOUT TRUMP -- YOU HEARD HIM, HE SAYS AMERICA FIRST. AS IF WE WOULD NOT PUT AMERICA FIRST. THAT IS SURE WHAT I BELIEVE. HE SAYS IT, BUT THEN EVERYTHING HE MAKES, HE MAKES SOMEWHERE ELSE. HE MAKES DRESS SHIRTS AND CHINA, NOT BROOKLYN, NEW YORK. HE MAKES FURNITURE IN TURKEY, NOT CLEVELAND, OHIO. HE MAKES BARWARE IN SLOVENIA, NOT JACKSON, OHIO. AND HE GOES AROUND SAYING HE WANTS TO PUT AMERICA FIRST AND AMERICA WORKERS FIRST. JUST TODAY WE LEARNED, ONCE AGAIN, HE HAS ASKED FOR VISAS TO EMPLOY FOREIGN WORKERS AT HIS COUNTRY CLUBS BECAUSE HE SAYS HE CANNOT FIND ANY AMERICAN WORKERS. SHAME ON YOU, DONALD TRUMP. SHAME ON YOU. LET'S CUT THROUGH ALL OF THE HYPE AND THE RHETORIC AND UNDERSTAND WE'RE DEALING WITH SOMEBODY WHO HAS A HISTORY OF STIFFING PEOPLE, MAKING THINGS SOMEWHERE ELSE BESIDES AMERICA, AND WHENEVER POSSIBLE, HIRING FOREIGN WORKERS. I DO NOT THINK THAT ADDS UP IN ANY WAY TO MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I THINK AS UP TO MAKING DONALD TRUMP MORE MONEY. THAT IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT. -- I THINK IT ADDS UP TO MAKING DONALD TRUMP MORE MONEY. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE ECONOMY FAIRER. WE'RE GOING TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE SO THAT NOBODY WORKS FULL-TIME WILL BE IN POVERTY.   AND YOU HAVE HEARD IT BEFORE BUT I WILL SAY IT AGAIN -- THE FASTEST WAY TO RAISE INCOME IN AMERICA IS TO PAY WOMEN EQUAL PAY FOR THE WORK WE DO.   THIS IS NOT JUST A WOMAN'S ISSUE, THIS IS A FAMILY ISSUE. IF YOU HAVE GOT A WORKING MOTHER, WIFE, SISTER OR DAUGHTER, IT IS YOUR ISSUE. AND WE ARE GOING TO ENFORCE THE LAWS AND FINALLY MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR -- NO MORE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN WHO WORK IN THE WORKPLACE.   I KNOW WE ARE UP AGAINST SOME POWERFUL FORCES. HERE IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW AS YOU TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS, YOUR NEIGHBORS ABOUT THIS ELECTION. EVERYTHING I HAVE PROPOSED -- AND YOU CAN GO TO HILLARY CLINTON.COM AND READ ABOUT IT -- I HAVE TOLD YOU HOW I WILL PAY FOR. HOW WILL I PAY FOR? -- FOR IT? BY MAKING THE WEALTHY CORPORATIONS AND WALL STREET FINALLY PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES.   SOMEBODY ASKED ME, WELL, WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT? YOU RESENT SUCCESS? NO, I DO NOT RESENT SUCCESS. I DO RESENT PEOPLE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OTHER PEOPLE TO TRY TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL. BUT THE REASON WE ARE GOING TO GET THE WEALTHY TO PAY IS THAT IS WHERE THE MONEY IS. THEY HAVE EARNED 90% OF ALL OF THE INCOME GAINED SINCE THE RECESSION. THAT IS THE TOP 1%. AND I JUST THINK, LIKE THAT OLD MOVIE SAYS, YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE MONEY AND THE MONEY IS WITH THE SUPER WEALTHY.   NOW, WE'RE ALSO GOING TO DO MORE FOR EDUCATION, STARTING WITH PRESCHOOL EDUCATION.   WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT OUR TEACHERS IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO DO THE JOB WE ARE ASKING THEM TO DO.   WE ARE GOING TO MAKE FOUR-TEYEAR COLLEGE AFFORDABLE BY MAKING IT DEBT-FR EE.   AND WE ARE GOING TO HELP THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE STUDENT DEBT PAY IT BACK AT A LOWER INTEREST RATE AT A FASTER TIMETABLE.   AND IF YOU DO PUBLIC SERVICE LIKE TEACHING, POLICING, FIREFIGHTING, SOCIAL WORK, WE WILL FORGIVE YOUR DEBT.   THIS SEEMS TO ME, ALSO, TO BE FAIR HERE IT DONALD TRUMP -- BE FAIR. DONALD TRUMP GETS TO REFINANCE IN FORGIVE HIS DEBT. WHAT ABOUT THE FAMILIES AND STUDENTS OF AMERICA? IF YOU VOTE FOR US, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NEXT YEAR.   SO, THERE IS THE BIG AGENDA. I'VE WATCHED WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS. A LOT OF THE RHETORIC THAT CAME FROM TRUMP AND HIS CONVENTION WAS SO DARK, SO PESSIMISTIC, SO NEGATIVE. I KNOW WE HAVE PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES, I AM NOT TAKING A POSITION THAT WE DO NOT HAVE WORK TO DO. IN FACT, I AM TELLING YOU WHAT WORK WE CAN DO TOGETHER. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE AMERICANS ARE BETTER WHEN WE ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES, SET SOME GOALS AND WE WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE YES, WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER.   AND I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO. YOU SEE, I VIEW THIS CAMPAIGN AS A GIANT JOB INTERVIEW. I AM HERE TELLING YOU WHAT I WANT TO ACHIEVE, ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE, AND ASKING YOU ALSO TO HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE. I WANT YOU NOT JUST TO VOTE FOR ME IN  NOVEMBER, BUT HELP MAY BE THE BEST PRESIDENT I CAN BE FOR ALL AMERICANS.   I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT FOR EVERY AMERICAN.   AND THAT IS WHY TODAY, TIM AND I AND ANNE ARE HERE, BECAUSE WE ARE KICKING OFF THIS CAMPAIGN IN OHIO. YES, WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. I SEE SOME OF THE T-SHIRTS AND THE SIGNS. WE WILL DEFEND PLANNED PARENTHOOD FROM THESE OUTRAGEOUS ATTACKS.   WE WILL DEFEND AND IMPROVE BENEFITS UNDER SOCIAL SECURITY.   WE WILL TAKE ON THE GUN LOBBY FOR CONTRA DANCES -- FOR COMPREHENSIVE GUN SAFETY REFORM.   WE WILL TAKE ON THE REAL CHALLENGES THAT CONFRONT AMERICA, NOT PICK FIGHTS WITH PEOPLE, NOT ACT AS THOUGH SOME FOLKS ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS, NOT INSULT AND FINGER-POINTING. WE ARE GOING TO STAND UP FOR AMERICA'S RIGHTS, FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND GAY RIGHTS AND VOTING RIGHTS AND WORKERS RIGHTS.   BUT WE CANNOT DO ANY OF THIS WITHOUT YOUR HELP. AND I AM ASKING FOR. -- FOR IT. WE NEED YOU TO GET INVOLVED WITH THE CAMPAIGN. IF YOU WILL TEXT, JOIN AT 47246 OR GO TO HILLARY CLINTON.COM, YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW TO GET INVOLVED. AND BY THE WAY, WE ARE HIRING ORGANIZERS IN OHIO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN BEING PART OF OUR CAMPAIGN STAFF. BECAUSE AT THE END OF THIS ELECTION, I WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE MADE AN INFORMED CHOICE. I DO NOT WANT FOLKS TO BE MISLED, TO LISTEN TO THE RHETORIC AND DEMAGOGUERY. I PERSONALLY THINK DONALD TRUMP POSES A SERIOUS THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY.   IT IS GOING TO BE UP TO ALL OF US TO REPUDIATE THE HATEFULNESS, ATTACKS ON DISTINGUISHED MILITARY LEADERS LIKE GENERAL JOHN ALLEN WHO CAME TO THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION BECAUSE HE LOVES A COUNTRY THAT HE SERVED FOR MORE THAN 40 YEARS AND WANTED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS BEST FOR OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. OR INSULTING THE FAMILY OF A FALLEN SOLDIER. CAPTAIN KHAN, AN AMERICAN MUSLIM WHO SACRIFICED HIS LIFE TO PROTECT HIS UNIT IN OTHER SOLDIERS AS A TAXI RACED TOWARDS THE BASE OF A -- BEGINS OF A BASE CONTAINING A BOMB. WHEN HIS FATHER SPOKE AT THE CONVENTION AND PULLED OUT A COPY OF THE CONSTITUTION --   IT WAS SO FITTING THAT HAPPENED IN PHILADELPHIA, WHERE OUR COUNTRY STARTED 240 YEARS AGO. THEY ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION THE PRINCIPLE OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT AMERICA WOULD BE INCLUDING AND ATTRACTING PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. GEORGE WASHINGTON, THOMAS JEFFERSON -- THEY ADDRESS DIFFERENT RELIGIONS, INCLUDING ISLAM, THAT WERE PRESENT IN AMERICA WAY BACK AT OUR BEGINNING. AND I WANT US ALWAYS TO STAND FOR FREEDOM AND EQUALITY AND JUSTICE AND OPPORTUNITY. NOW AND FOREVER. HELP US GO OUT AND WIN AN ELECTION THAT WILL KEEP OUR DEMOCRACY STRONG, OUR ECONOMY GROWING, AND GIVE EVERY AMERICAN A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL.

THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, COMMANDER FOR THAT VERY WARM WELCOME. THANKS TO YOUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BOB WALLACE. AND ALL THE MILK AND WOMEN OF THE VFW -- MEN AND WOMEN OF THE VFW FOR YOUR COMMITMENT, YOUR SERVICE, AND YOUR ACTION ON BEHALF OF AMERICA'S VETERANS. THIS IS THE 117TH NATIONAL CONVENTION. THAT IS QUITE A LEGACY. AND IN THAT TIME THE VFW HAS BUILT A RECORD TO BE PROUD OF. YOU HAVE BEEN A MOVING FORCE BEHIND HALLMARK ACHIEVEMENTS LIKE THE CREATION OF THE V.A., THE PASSAGE OF THE G.I. BILL, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL MONUMENTS DEDICATED TO THOSE WHO FOUGHT IN WORLD WAR II, THE KOREAN WAR, THE WAR IN VIETNAM, WOMEN IN MILITARY SERVICE, AND VETERANS DISABLED FOR LIFE. THESE MONUMENTS ARE SACRED PLACES. I HAVE BEEN TO MANY OF THEM. ALSO TO OUR CEMETERIES AROUND THE WORLD. PEOPLE COME TO SIT QUIETLY, MAYBE LAY A FLOWER OR A LETTER OR OTHER MEMENTO. TO REFLECT ON THE COURAGE AND SACRIFICE OF THOSE WHO FOUGHT FOR OUR NATION AND OUR IDEALS. I DON'T THINK IT IS AN OVERSTATEMENT FOR ME TO SAY THOSE MEMORIALS MIGHT NOT EXIST IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU. SO THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TODAY AND EVERY DAY FOR VETERANS HEALTH, FOR VETERANS EDUCATION, FOR THE RIGHT OF ALL VETERANS TO DIGNITY AND SECURITY. AND THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO PUSH OUR NATION, TO LIVE UP TO OUR OBLIGATIONS TO THOSE WHO SERVE. I HAVE BEEN A DIRECT BENEFICIARY OF YOUR EXPERTISE AND COMMITMENT. SOME OF MY TOP ADVISERS ARE MEMBERS OF THE VFW. I'M GRATEFUL TO ALL THE VETERANS AND RETIRED MILITARY LEADERS WHO HAVE SHARED THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND COUNSEL WITH ME. I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK THE VFW FOR THE CLOSE CONSULTATION YOU PROVIDED AS WE WORK TO PUT FORTH OUR PLAN TO REFORM THE V.A. TODAY I ESPECIALLY WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND APPRECIATE RETIRED MARINE GENERAL JOHN ALLEN, FORMER DEPUTY COMMANDER OF THE U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND AND COMMANDER OF THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCE OVERSEEING NATO TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN. I HAD THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH GENERAL ALLEN, AND THEREFORE I AM DEEPLY HONORED THAT HE ENDORSED ME THIS MORNING. HIS CONFIDENCE IN ME AND THAT OF THE OTHER ESTEEMED MILITARY LEADERS SUPPORT MY CAMPAIGN MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO ME. BUT IT ALSO IMPOSES A HIGH RESPONSIBILITY ON ME AS WELL. SO I THINK YOU. ANK YOU. I THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE BEHIND THE SCENES AS WELL AS IN PUBLIC TO MAKE SURE THAT AMERICA KEEPS OUR PROMISES, HONORS OUR HISTORY, AND GIVES OUR VETERANS THE RESPECT AND THE OPPORTUNITIES THEY HAVE EARNED. A LOT OF THE ISSUES YOU HAVE FOUGHT FOR OUR AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION -- ARE AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. AMERICA IS GRAPPLING WITH BIG QUESTIONS. HOW DO WE KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE? HOW DO WE MAKE THE WORLD SAFER? HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE GIVE OUR TROOPS WHAT THEY NEED TO SEE THEIR MISSIONS THROUGH? AND WHEN THEY COME HOME THAT THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT AND ACCESS TO SERVICES THEY NEED TO LEAD HEALTHY, REDUCTIV PRODUCTIVE, SUCCESSFUL LIVES. THESE CHALLENGES MATTER TO ME PERSONALLY. MY FATHER ENLISTED IN THE NAVY SHORTLY AFTER THE JAPANESE ATTACKED PEARL HARBOR. BECAME A CHIEF PETTY OFFICER RESPONSIBLE FOR TRAINING THOUSANDS OF YOUNG SAILORS BEFORE THEY SHIPPED OUT TO SEA, MOSTLY TO THE PACIFIC THEATER. AFTER MY FATHER DIED IN 1993, I RECEIVED LETTERS AND OLD PHOTOS FROM MEN WHO HAD SERVED UNDER HIM. TALKING ABOUT WHAT A DIFFERENCE MY DAD MADE IN THEIR LIVES. THESE ARE LETTERS THAT I TREASURE. MY DAD ONCE TOLD ME HOW SAD HE FELT WHEN HE LEFT GREAT LAKES NAVAL BASE AND ACCOMPANIED HIS TRAINEES TO THE WEST COAST TO JOIN THEIR SHIPS. HE KNEW SOME OF THESE BRIGHT, ENERGETIC YOUNG MEN WOULDN'T SURVIVE. SOME OF THEM PROBABLY THOUGHT IT, TOO. BUT STILL THEY WENT TO SERVE. BECAUSE THEY KNEW OUR COUNTRY NEEDED THEM. THAT'S THE KIND OF COURAGE AND HONOR OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM DEMONSTRATED EVERY SINGLE DAY -- DEMONSTRATE EVERY SINGLE DAY. I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT MY FATHER'S EXPERIENCES LATER WHEN I BECAME A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK SERVING ON THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE. AND THEN AS SECRETARY OF STATE. I HAVE WORKED HARD OVER THE YEARS ON MANY OF THE ISSUES YOU CARE ABOUT AND WORK ON EVERY DAY. I AM NOT A NEWCOMER TO THESE ISSUES. AND TODAY I WANT TO TELL YOU A FEW OF MY CORE BELIEFS WHICH WILL GUIDE ME IF I HAVE THE GREAT HONOR TO BE ELECTED THIS FALL. BECAUSE AMERICANS AREN'T JUST CHOOSING A PRESIDENT. WE ARE ALSO CHOOSING A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. THE PERSON WHO DECIDES QUESTIONS OF WAR AND PEACE, LIFE AND DEATH. THERE'S NO MORE SOLEMN OR SERIOUS A RESPONSIBILITY THAN THAT. SO YOU DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT WE CANDIDATES BELIEVE ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY AND HOW WE GO ABOUE'D GO ABOUT MAKING LIFE OR DEATH CALLS. BECAUSE THEY WILL AFFECT OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM FIRST AND FOREMOST AND THEY WILL AFFECT OUR VETERANS. LET'S START HERE. I BELIEVE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS AN EXCEPTIONAL NATION WITH CAPABILITIES THAT NO OTHER COUNTRY COMES CLOSE TO MATCHING. AND WE HAVE --  -- WE HAVE THE WORLD'S GREATEST MILITARY. DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU OTHERWISE.  WE ALSO HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT IS LARGER, MORE DURABLE, AND MORE ENTREPRENEURIAL THAN ANY OTHER ON THE PLANET. AND WE ARE GUIDED BY VALUES THAT HAVE LONG INSPIRED PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD, A COMMITMENT TO FREEDOM AND EQUALITY, JUSTICE AND DIVERSITY. THAT FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN IDEA THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON DESERVES TO BE TREATED DECENTLY AND WITH RESPECT, NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE.  I BELIEVE IN STANDING WITH OUR ALLIES, BECAUSE THEY ARE PART OF WHAT MAKES US EXCEPTIONAL. NO OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS RELATIONSHIPS LIKE WE DO. GENERATIONS OF AMERICAN TROOPS FOUGHT AND, YES, DIED TO SECURE THOSE BONDS. BECAUSE THEY KNEW WE WERE SAFER WITH MORE FRIENDS AND PARTNERS AND FEWER ADVERSARIES AND ENEMIES.  OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM KERRY THAT WORK FORWARD TODAY -- CARRY THAT WORK FORWARD TODAY. MY RUNNING MATE THIS ELECTION IS A WONDERFUL MAN FROM VIRGINIA NAMED TIM KAINE. HE WAS GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, MAYOR OF RICHMOND, VIRGINIA. IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH HIM YET I URGE YOU TO CHECK HIM OUT. HE'S A GREAT PUBLIC SERVANT AND A TERRIFIC GUY. HIS SON IS A MARINE. HIS SON IS ACTUALLY DEPLOYING TODAY TO HELP DEFEND OUR NATO ALLIES IN EUROPE. THAT'S HOW COMMITTED HE IS. AND MANY OTHERS ARE TO OUR ALLIANCES. AND WE SHOULD BE, TOO. AFTER ALL, AMERICA'S WORD HAS TO MEAN SOMETHING.  I BELIEVE IN BEING FIRM, BUT WISE WITH OUR RIVALS. FINDING COMMON GROUND WHERE WE CAN, AND STANDING OUR GROUND WHEN WE MUST. THAT'S THE BALANCE THAT MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO WORK WITH ALL KINDS OF NATIONS. TO WORK TO INCREASE PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA. TO WORK TO STAND UP TO THE CHINESE AND THE SOUTH CHINA SEA. TO WORK WITH RUSSIA TO CONCLUDE THE NEW START TREATY THAT REDUCES NUCLEAR STOCKPILE WHILE STANDING UP TO THEM -- STOCKPILES WHILE STANDING UP TO THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR THREATS TO OUR FRIENDS IN EASTERN EUROPE. ONE THING FOR CERTAIN. YOU WILL NOT EVER HEAR FROM ME IS PRAISE FOR DICTATORS AND STRONGMEN WHO HAVE NO LOVE FOR AMERICA.  AND YES, I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART IN DEMOCRACY. AND I BELIEVE IN DIPLOMACY. IT'S OFTEN THE ONLY WAY TO AVOID CONFLICTS THAT CAN END UP EXACTING A MUCH GREATER COST. I BELIEVE THE MOST SACRED RESPONSIBILITY OF A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IS DECIDING WHETHER TO SEND MEN AND WOMEN INTO BATTLE. I HAVE VISITED OUR TROOPS IN THEATERS OF WAR AND TENSION. I KNOW HOW SERIOUS THIS IS. FORCE MUST ONLY BE USED AS A LAST RESORT. AND ONLY WITH A CLEAR AND WELL THOUGHT OUT STRATEGY. OUR TROOPS DESERVE NOTHING LESS. AMERICA EXPECTS NOTHING LESS. I BELIEVE OUR TROOPS STRIVE TO COMPORT THEMSELVES WITH HONOR. AND THEY DESERVE A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO WILL NEVER ORDER THEM TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES. I BELIEVE IN LISTENING TO OUR GENERALS AND ADMIRALS, BECAUSE THEY HAVE IN VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCES AND THEY ARE DOING ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS THERE IS. COMMANDING AMERICA'S SONS AND DAUGHTERS. AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF I WILL ALWAYS SHOW THEM RESPECT AND HEAR THEM OUT. YOU WILL NEVER HEAR ME SAY THAT I ONLY LISTEN TO MYSELF ON NATIONAL SECURITY.  I BELIEVE IN DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MEET THREATS AT HOME AND ABROAD. I KNOW WE LIVE IN A DANGEROUS WORLD. THAT'S WHY WE NEED REAL PLANS, REAL STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH TERRORISM, INCLUDING HOMEGROWN TERRORISM. I HAVE WORKED WITH EXPERIENCED PEOPLE FROM ACROSS DIFFERENT FIELDS AND INDEED ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM TO COME UP WITH COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIES FOR THESE AND OTHER THREATS. I WILL BE READY TO GET TO WORK ON DAY ONE. I TAKE NOTHING MORE SERIOUSLY THAN OUR SECURITY. MOST OF ALL, I BELIEVE IN AMERICAN LEADERSHIP. I BELIEVE THAT WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE, THE VALUES THAT WE HOLD DEAR, THE HISTORY THAT WE CARE ABOUT, MATTERS A GREAT DEAL. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN TALKING PROVOCATIVELY. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN INSULTING PEOPLE, INCLUDING OUR MILITARY. I'M INTERESTED IN BRINGING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER. I'M INTERESTED IN HEALING THE DIVISIONS. WE HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES AGAINST TERRORISTS. TO DO THAT WE NEED TO LEAD OTHER COUNTRIES IN STOPPING ISIS, AL QAEDA, AND OTHER RADICAL JIHADIST GROUPS. WE SHOULDN'T LEAVE THAT TO THE REST OF THE WORLD TO FIGURE OUT ON THEIR OWN. THAT WON'T KEEP US SAFE. WE NEED A STRONG GLOBAL ECONOMY BECAUSE IT'S GOOD FOR AMERICAN JOBS AND EXPORTS. THAT MEANS WE SHOULD LEAD IN SETTING AND ENFORCING THE RULES. IF WE RETREAT ON EITHER SECURITY OR THE ECONOMY BEHIND SOME KIND OF IMAGINARY WALL, WE WILL HAVE LOST OUR LEADERSHIP, OUR PURPOSE, OUR CHANCE TO PREVAIL IN THE 21ST CENTURY. AND IF AMERICA DOESN'T LEAD, WE LEAVE BEHIND A VACUUM. AND THAT WILL EITHER CAUSE CHAOS OR ENABLE OTHER COUNTRIES TO RUSH IN TO FILL THAT VOID. THEN THEY WILL BE THE ONES MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT AMERICAN LIVES, JOBS, AND SAFETY. AND THE CHOICES MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT MIGHT WELL NOT BE TO OUR BENEFIT. THAT'S NOT AN OUTCOME WE CAN LIVE WITH. I HAVE SET FORTH PLANS AND STRATEGIES FOR DEALING WITH THESE THREATS. I KNOW HOW CHALLENGING IT WILL BE TO MEET THE DIFFICULTIES THAT WE FACE IN THE WORLD TODAY. BUT YOU SEEM, I HAVE CONFIDENCE -- YOU SEE, I HAVE CONFIDENCE. I HAVE OPTIMISM. I DON'T UNDERSTAND PEOPLE WHO TRASH TALK ABOUT AMERICA. WHO TALK ABOUT US AS BEING IN DECLINE. WHO ACT AS THOUGH WE ARE NOT YET THE GREATEST COUNTRY THAT HAS EVER BEEN CREATED ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH FOR ALL OF HISTORY.  IF YOU WANT SOMEBODY WHO WILL PEDDLE FEAR AND SMEAR, I'M NOT YOUR CANDIDATE. I'M INTERESTED IN BRINGING EVERYBODY TOGETHER. ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES AND GETTING TO WORK TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS. THAT'S WHY IN THE SENATE I WORKED CLOSELY WITH REPUBLICANS. NOW, AS SOME OF YOU MIGHT KNOW, I HAVE BEEN THE RECIPIENT OF NUMEROUS POLITICAL ATTACKS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. I HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE WITH THAT. I HAVE AS ELEANOR ROOSEVELT ADVISED MANY YEARS AGO, IF A WOMAN WANTS TO BE IN THE PUBLIC ARENA, YOU HAD BETTER DEVELOP SKIN AS THICK AS THE HEIGHT OF A RHINOCEROS -- HIDE OF A RHINOCEROS.  SO WHEN I GOT TO THE SENATE I DIDN'T SAY, I'M ONLY GOING TO TALK TO DEMOCRATS. I'M NOT GOING TO WORK WITH REPUBLICANS. HOW SILLY WITH THAT BE? DASHWOOD THAT-- HOW SILLY WOULD THAT BE? PEOPLE ELECTED ME TO BE THERE SENATOR. IR SENATOR. SO I WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS TO EXPAND VETERANS ACCESS TO MILITARY HEALTH INSURANCE. TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL MEMBERS OF THE RESERVES AND NATIONAL GUARD AND THEIR FAMILIES HAD ACCESS TO TRYICARE MILITARY HEALTH BENEFITS EVEN WHEN THEY WERE NOT DEPLOYED. I INTRODUCED THE HEROES AT A HOME ACT TO ESTABLISH NEW SERVICES FOR MILITARY MEMBERS AND VETERANS SUFFERING FROM POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS AND TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES. I AM ENDED THE 2007 DEFENSE APPROPRIATION ACT TO ESTABLISH A TRAINING PROGRAM FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS HELPING THEIR LOVED ONES WITH TBI. I DID ALL OF THIS BECAUSE I HAD MET SO MANY WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO WERE STRUGGLING BECAUSE THEY LOST A SON OR DAUGHTER, MOTHER OR FATHER, WIFE OR HUSBAND. STRUGGLING BECAUSE THEIR LOVED ONE CAME HOME AND DIDN'T HAVE THE CARE THAT HE OR SHE NEEDED. THEY DESERVED MORE SUPPORT FROM ALL OF US. AND I FORTUNATELY WAS IN A POSITION TO ADVOCATE FOR THEM. I JOINED FORCES WITH SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN TO PERSONALLY RAISE MONEY FOR THE INTREPID FALLEN HEROES FUND. WHICH HELPED BUILD A STATE-OF-THE-ART REHAB FACILITY IN SAN ANTONIO TO HEALTH ARE SERIOUSLY WOUNDED SERVICEMEMBERS COMING HOME FROM IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.  AND LET ME JUST SAY, IT WAS A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH SENATOR MCCAIN ON THAT PROJECT AND MANY OTHERS. I BELIEVE THAT HE AND ALL AMERICAN PRISONERS OF WAR ARE HEROES AND DESERVE THE RESPECT THAT THAT ENTAILS.  AS PRESIDENT, I WILL BUILD ON THE WORK I'VE DONE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A 21ST CENTURY DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS THAT DELIVERS WORLD-CLASS CARE. LIKE YOU, I WAS OUTRAGED BY THE BA SCANDALS -- V.A. SCANDALS. PEOPLE WAITING MONTHS, EVEN YEARS FOR THINGS LIKE WHEELCHAIRS AND BASIC MEDICATION. SOME EVEN DYING WHILE LANGUISHING ON A WAIT LIST FOR AN APPOINTMENT. HEARTBREAKING AND ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. THAT'S WHY I HAVE PUT FORTH A DETAILED PLAN ABOUT WHAT I WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT TO REVAMP THE V.A.. IT WILL BE ONE OF MY HIGHEST PRIORITIES. BUT I TELL YOU THIS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO PRIVATIZE THE V.A.. WE ARE GOING TO REFORM IT AND MAKE IT WORK FOR EVERY SINGLE VETERAN IN AMERICA.  WE WILL ENSURE ACCESS TO TIMELY QUALITY CARE. IMPROVE THE COORDINATION OF CARE WHICH IS AS YOU KNOW A HUGE PROBLEM STILL. IMPROVE CARE FOR WOMEN VETERANS WHO ARE OFTEN UNDERSERVED.  TACKLE AND AT LONG LAST END THE EPIDEMIC OF VETERAN SUICIDES BY EXPANDING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE, ERASING THE STIGMA THAT STILL PREVENTS TOO MANY FROM GETTING THE HELP THEY NEED. I KNOW THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE VFW AND OTHER VETERANS SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO SUPPORT YOU IN THIS CRITICAL WORK. AND WE ARE GOING TO HELP MORE VETERANS LOOKING FOR JOBS WITH EXPANDED TAX CREDITS FOR BUSINESSES THAT HIRE VETERANS, MORE SUPPORT TO VETERANS WHO WANT TO START THEIR OWN BUSINESSES, BETTER CERTIFICATION AND CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS. THE WORK THAT VETERANS DID ON ACTIVE DUTY WILL BE UNDERSTOOD AND RESPECTED AS THEY COMPETE FOR JOBS IN THE CIVILIAN SECTOR THAT THEY DESERVE TO BE CONSIDERED FOR AND TIRED TO PERFORM -- HIRED TO PERFORM.  AND I'M GOING TO CRACK DOWN ON COMPANIES THAT PREY ON OR DISCRIMINATE AGAINST VETERANS. THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES. AND WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. WE WILL ALSO FOLLOW THE LEAD OF CITIES LIKE NEW ORLEANS, HOUSTON, PHILADELPHIA, AND LAS VEGAS, WHICH HAVE WORKED TO END VETERAN HOMELESSNESS.  WE HAVE LESSONS TO LEARN FROM THEM. MANY MORE CITIES ARE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD THAT SAME GOAL. WE SHOULD SUPPORT THEM AND END THE TRAGEDY OF VETERAN HOMELESSNESS ONCE AND FOR ALL. AND I WILL PROTECT, PRESERVE AND DEFEND THE POST-9/11 G.I. BILL. IT HAS OPENED DOORS OF OPPORTUNITY TO MORE THAN ONE MILLION VETERANS AND FAMILY MEMBERS. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE SOME REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS CHIPPING AWAY AT IT. THAT'S NOT JUST WRONG. IT IS SHORTSIGHTED. THIS PROGRAM HELPS US RECRUIT AND RETAIN THE ALL VOLUNTEER FORCE WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY. AND IT'S A WAY TO INVEST IN FAMILIES AND OUR SHARED FUTURE. WE SHOULD PROTECT AND STRENGTHEN IT. NOT LET ANYONE THEERODE IT. I HAVE PLANS TO DO ALL THIS AND MORE, INCLUDING SUPPORTING MILITARY SPOUSES AS THEY SEEK TO BUILD CAREERS. INCLUDING STANDING WITH WOMEN, STANDING WITH LGBT VETERANS TO MAKE SURE THEY GET THE SUPPORT THEY HAVE EARNED. YOU CAN GO TO MY WEBSITE, AND I HOPE YOU WILL. HILLARYCLINTON.COM AND READ ALL THE DETAILS. I HOPE YOU WILL NOT ONLY BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW BUT, THERE'S A LOT OF EXPERTISE IN THIS ROOM. AND I WANT YOUR IDEAS, TOO. I HAVE THIS OLD-FASHIONED NOTION. YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT, YOU SHOULD TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AS SPECIFICALLY AS POSSIBLE SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY MAKE UP THEIR MINDS. AND THEN YOU SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU DELIVER RESULTS. SO HERE'S MY BOTTOM LINE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT. BUT I KNOW A LOT OF VETERANS STILL FEEL INVISIBLE, POWERLESS. LIKE THEIR COUNTRY HAS FORGOTTEN THEM. THAT IS JUST TOTALLY WRONG. IT'S UNACCEPTABLE AND WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE WE END THAT. NOW WE CAN DISAGREE ABOUT THE DETAILS. I'M SURE WE WILL FROM TIME TO TIME. YOU SEE, I ACTUALLY BELIEVE AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN IN PUBLIC LIFE AND PUBLIC SERVICE, IT'S BETTER IF WE HAVE HONEST CANDIDATE CONVERSATIONS. THAT'S THE BEST WAY IN A DEMOCRACY FOR US TO COME UP WITH THE BEST SOLUTIONS. BUT WE SHOULD BE GUIDED BY OUR VALUES. WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT OUR TROOPS DESERVE SERIOUS STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP. WE CAN ALL AGREE WE HAVE TO BE SERIOUS AND COMMITTED IN ADDRESSING THE COMPLEX CHALLENGES WE FACE HERE AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD. BENEATH WHATEVER DISAGREEMENTS WE MIGHT HAVE AS A COUNTRY ABOUT HOW TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO GO, SURELY WE CAN START LISTENING TO ONE ANOTHER AGAIN. RESPECTING ONE ANOTHER. OUR INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES THAT BRING SO MUCH TO THE DEBATE. MY FATHER MADE SURE I UNDERSTOOD THAT THE FREEDOMS AND RIGHTS WE ENJOY AS AMERICANS DIDN'T COME OUT OF THIN AIR. PEOPLE SACRIFICED FOR THEM. THOUGHTFOUGHT, BLED, AND DIED FOR THEM. PEOPLE LIKE YOU. AND THE GENERATIONS OF SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, AND COAST GUARD'S SMEN WHO HAVE MADE OUR COUNTRY STRONG, PROUD, AND FREE. EVERY ONE OF YOU DESERVE OUR THANKS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, OUR RESPECT. AND YOU DESERVE A COUNTRY AND A PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO HONOR YOUR SERVICE. NOT JUST WITH WORDS, BUT WITH DEEDS. THAT'S WHAT THE VFW HAS STOOD FOR. TO MAKE SURE AMERICA LIVES UP TO THAT STANDARD. AND AS PRESIDENT, I WILL BE WORKING ALONGSIDE YOU AS I DID AS SENATOR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PRODUCE RESULTS. I KNOW THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT ONE OF OUR TWO MAJOR PARTIES HAS EVER NOMINATED A WOMAN. AND I KNOW --  -- THAT IT TAKES A LITTLE GETTING USED TO, EVEN FOR ME. BUT HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW. I WILL GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE, DOING EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY, TO TREAT OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM WITH THE CARE AND CONCERN AND RESPECT THEY DESERVE, TO MAKE GOOD ON OUR NATION'S PROMISES TO OUR VETERANS. THAT'S HOW I WAS RAISED. THAT'S WHAT I HAVE DONE. AND I PROMISE YOU THAT'S WHAT I WILL DO. THANK YOU, VFW. GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

I AM SO EXCITED AND GRATEFUL TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU.   I MUST SAY, AFTER EVERYTHING WE HAVE JUST SEEN AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION THIS PAST WEEK --    BEING HERE WITH YOU ON THIS BEAUTIFUL DAY IS TRULY LIKE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR.   WHEN I LOOK OUT AT ALL OF YOU, YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE? I SEE AMERICA'S FUTURE.   INSTEAD OF THE FEAR AND THE ANGER AND THE RESENTMENT, THE LACK OF ANY SOLUTIONS TO HELP WORKING FAMILIES GET AHEAD OR KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE, I SENSE THE CONFIDENCE, THE OPTIMISM THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER, AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THAT FUTURE BETTER. [CHEERS  DONALD TRUMP A THINK AMERICA IS IN DECLINE, BUT HE IS WRONG. AMERICA'S BEST DAYS ARE STILL AHEAD OF US, MY FRIENDS. [CHEERS  AND WHEN HE SAID, AS HE DID SAY, ""I ALONE CAN FIX IT"" --   HE IS NOT ONLY WRONG, HE IS DANGEROUSLY WRONG. WE AMERICANS, WE SOLVE PROBLEMS TOGETHER, AND IF DONALD DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THAT, HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND AMERICA. I KNOW THAT NO ONE DOES ANYTHING ALL ALONE. AND PART OF OUR CHALLENGE IS TO MAKE SURE WE DO WORK TOGETHER. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS. I WANT TO THANK SENATOR BILL NELSON, WHO WAS WITH ME YESTERDAY IN ORLANDO AND TAMPA.   I WANT TO THANK CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. [CHEERS  AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HER AND WITH CONGRESSWOMAN FREDERICA WILSON.   AND CONGRESSWOMAN ALCEE HASTINGS.   AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS OF ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT WHO ARE IN HERE AND OUR VISION FOR THE COUNTRY.   NOW, NEXT WEEK -- NEXT WEEK IN PHILADELPHIA, WE WILL OFFER A VERY DIFFERENT VISION FOR OUR COUNTRY, ONE THAT IS ABOUT BUILDING BRIDGES, NOT WALLS.   EMBRACING THE DIVERSITY THAT MAKES OUR COUNTRY GREAT.   LIFTING EACH OTHER UP, STANDING TOGETHER, BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE IS NOTHING WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH ONCE WE MAKE UP OUR MINDS.  [CHEERS  AND THAT IS WHY I AM SO THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE THAT MY RUNNING MATE IS A MAN WHO DOES NOT JUST SHARE THOSE VALUES , HE LIVES THEM.   I HAVE TO SAY -- I HAVE TO SAY THAT SENATOR TIM KAINE IS EVERYTHING DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE ARE NOT.   HE IS QUALIFIED TO STEP INTO THIS JOB AND LEAD ON DAY ONE, AND HE IS A PROGRESSIVE WHO LIKES TO GET THINGS DONE.   THAT IS JUST MY KIND OF GUY. WE BOTH GREW UP IN THE MIDWEST. WE WERE RAISED BY FATHERS WHO RAN SMALL BUSINESSES AND WHO TAUGHT US ABOUT THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND THE DISCIPLINE OF A JOB WELL DONE, AND IN BOTH OF OUR FAMILIES, FAITH WASN'T JUST SOMETHING YOU TALKED ABOUT IN CHURCH ON SUNDAYS. IT WAS A CALL TO SERVE OTHERS IN EVERY WAY THAT WE CAN.   AND AS YOU GET TO KNOW SENATOR KAINE, YOU WILL SEE THAT TIM'S LIFELONG COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL JUSTICE IS A SHINING EXAMPLE OF HIS FAITH IN ACTION. YOU KNOW, DURING LAW SCHOOL, WHEN HIS FELLOW CLASSMATES WERE TAKING INTERNSHIPS AT PRESTIGIOUS LAW FIRMS, HE TOOK TIME OFF TO WORK WITH MISSIONARIES IN HONDURAS.   AT AFTER HE GRADUATED FROM HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, HE COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING -- AND AFTER HE GRADUATED FROM HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, HE COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING. INSTEAD, HE CHOSE TO BECOME A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER. ONE OF HIS FIRST CASES WAS A PRO BONO CASE, REPRESENTING A WOMAN WHO WAS DENIED AN APARTMENT BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRICAN-AMERICAN.   SO WHILE TIM WAS TAKING ON HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AND HOMELESSNESS, DONALD TRUMP WAS DENYING APARTMENTS TO PEOPLE WHO WERE AFRICAN-AMERICAN.   HE IS STILL FIGHTING THOSE BATTLES TODAY, SERVING AS A NONPARTISAN CITY COUNCIL MEMBER, THEN THE MAYOR OF RICHMOND, VIRGINIA.   HE WORKED HARD TO BRIDGE RACIAL DIVIDES, HE BUILT THE FIRST NEW SCHOOLS IN A GENERATION, HE HELPED TURN THAT CITY AROUND, AND AS GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, HE LED THE COMMONWEALTH THROUGH THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS IN A GENERATION . WHAT DID HE DO? HE BROUGHT DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER TO PROTECT THE PROGRAMS THAT WORKING FAMILIES COUNT ON.   AND WILD MIKE PENCE -- WHILE MIKE PENCE SLASHED FUNDING AND GAVE MORE TAX CUTS TO THE WEALTHIEST, TIM KAINE CUT HIS OWN SALARY AND INVESTED IN EDUCATION FROM PRE-K THROUGH COLLEGE AND BEYOND.   AND BY THE TIME TIM LEFT OFFICE, 40% MORE OF VIRGINIA'S KIDS WERE ENROLLED IN EARLY-EDUCATION PROGRAMS. AND THEN, AS A UNITED STATES SENATOR, TIM USED HIS POSITION ON THE FOREIGN RELATIONS AND ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEES TO STAND UP FOR OUR VETERANS AND OUR VALUES AND OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM AND OUR SECURITY.   NOW, THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND, BECAUSE I AM HERE WITH HIM --    THAT TIM IS SO QUALIFIED TO BE VICE PRESIDENT, AND AS I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES, THE MOST IMPORTANT QUALIFICATION WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE THIS REALLY BIG CHOICE IS, CAN THIS PERSON STEPPED IN TO BE PRESIDENT? WELL, AT EVERY STAGE OF TIM'S CAREER, THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW HIM BEST HAVE VOTED TO GIVE HIM A PROMOTION, AND THAT IS BECAUSE --    THAT IS BECAUSE HE FIGHTS FOR THE PEOPLE HE REPRESENTS, AND HE DELIVERS REAL RESULT. NOW, I CANNOT WAIT FOR ALL OF YOU TO GET TO KNOW HIM THE WAY THAT I HAVE, THE PROUD FATHER OF THREE GROWN UP KIDS, WHO HAVE THEIR OWN LIVES AND ARE MAKING THEIR OWN CONTRIBUTIONS, INCLUDING SERVING OUR COUNTRY.   A LOVING HUSBAND OF A BRILLIANT WIFE, WHO --  [CHEERS  IS A GREAT FIGHTER FOR PROGRESSIVE CAUSES IN HER OWN RIGHT. A LEADER WHO CARES MORE ABOUT MAKING A DIFFERENCE THAN MAKING HEADLINES, AND --  [CHEERS  AND MAKE NO MISTAKE. BEHIND THAT SMILE, TIM ALSO HAS A BACKBONE OF STEEL. JUST ASK THE NRA.   OVER AND OVER AGAIN, HE HAS HAD THE COURAGE TO STAND UP TO THE GUN LOBBY IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD. [CHEERS  AFTER THE HORRIBLE VIRGINIA TECH SHOOTING, HE SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO REDEEM SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL -- WHO WERE DEEMED TO BE SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL, AND HE HAS SPOT FOR COMMONSENSE GUN REFORM ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- HE HAS FOUGHT FOR COMMONSENSE GUN REFORM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ASKING THAT WE GET THOSE REFORMS DONE. SO WHEN I SAY HE IS A PROGRESSIVE WHO LIKES TO GET THINGS DONE, I MEAN IT. HE IS NOT AFRAID TO TAKE ON SPECIAL INTERESTS, WHETHER IT IS CALLING FOR TOUGHER REGULATIONS ON PAYDAY LENDING OR FIGHTING BACK AGAINST ATTACKS ON PLANNED PARENTHOOD OR WOMEN MAKING THEIR OWN HEALTH DECISIONS, TIM HAS LED ON SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING OUR COUNTRY, FROM VOTING RIGHTS TO LGBT OF QUALITY --    TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS TO COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM.   NOW, AFTER LAST WEEK, I PROBABLY DO NOT NEED TO SAY THIS, BUT I WILL. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTIONS IN OUR LIFETIME. WHEN SOMEONE SAYS, ""I ALONE CAN FIX IT"" --   THAT SHOULD SET OFF ALARM BELLS IN NOT JUST DEMOCRATS' MINDS BUT WITH REPUBLICANS AND PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AND BACKGROUNDS. THAT IS NOT A DEMOCRACY.   I SAID -- I SAID YESTERDAY IN TAMPA, WE FOUGHT A REVOLUTION, BECAUSE WE DID NOT WANT ONE MAN MAKING ALL OF THE DECISIONS FOR US.   AND BESIDES, IT IS JUST NONSENSE. NO ONE DOES ANYTHING ALONE. WE DO NOT HAVE A ONE-PERSON MILITARY. WE DO NOT HAVE A ONE-PERSON TEACHING CORPS. WE DO NOT HAVE ONE DOCTOR AND ONE NURSE WHO FIXES EVERYTHING, DO WE? WE WORK TOGETHER. THAT IS WHAT HAS TRADITIONALLY SET US APART FROM PLACES THAT HAVE TURNED TO SINGLE LEADERS, DESPOTS, DICTATORS, AUTHORITARIANS, WHO HAVE PROMISED PEOPLE, ""I CAN FIX IT ALONE."" YOU KNOW WHAT THAT TELLS US QUESTION MARK THAT WE CANNOT DO IT OURSELVES, THAT WE CANNOT REACH OUT TO OTHERS, THAT WE CANNOT MAKE THE ECONOMY WORK FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. -- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT TELLS US? THAT WE CANNOT DO IT OURSELVES. I REJECT THAT, AND IN PHILADELPHIA, YOU WILL SEE A DIFFERENT KIND OF VISION.   SO I WANTED TO COME HERE TO MIAMI. I WANTED TO COME HERE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO THE PERSON THAT I JUST CANNOT THINK OF ANYBODY BETTER TO HAVE BY MY SIDE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, IN THE WHITE HOUSE. TOGETHER, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE ON THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE HURTING AMERICANS. WE ARE GOING TO GIVE THE MIDDLE CLASS A RAISE. WE ARE GOING TO GIVE TAX RELIEF TO MIDDLE FAMILIES TO HELP WITH THE RISING COST OF RAISING KIDS. WE ARE GOING TO CREATE JOBS. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA HAS A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. SO, PLEASE, JOIN US -- JOIN US. TAKE OUT YOUR PHONE RIGHT NOW. AND TEXT ""JOIN"" OR GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM, BECAUSE WE ARE HIRING ORGANIZERS IN FLORIDA RIGHT NOW, SO BE INVOLVED IN EVERY WAY THAT YOU CAN'T, BECAUSE TOGETHER, WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE ELECTION -- SO BE INVOLVED IN EVERY WAY THAT YOU CAN, BECAUSE TOGETHER, WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE ELECTION AND TAKE AMERICA FORWARD.

THANK YOU, NORTHERN VIRGINIA. IT IS SUCH A GREAT TREAT FOR ME TO BE BACK HERE AND HAVE THIS CHANCE TO APPEAR WITH YOUR GREAT SENATOR, A FORMER GOVERNOR, A FORMER MAYOR OF RICHMOND, TIM KAINE.   I APPRECIATE SO MUCH THE LEADERSHIP THAT HE HAS SHOWN FOR THIS STATE. NOW HE IS DOING THE SAME IN THE CONGRESS, AND HE IS WORKING WITH SUPREME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. GERRY CONNOLLY, BOBBY SCOTT, DON BYER. WE THANK THEM FOR THEIR SERVICE.   AND I REALLY LOVED WHAT TIM SAID. I LIKE THE THREE QUESTIONS HE POSED. THINK ABOUT IT. BECAUSE YOU REALLY ARE CONDUCTING A GIANT JOB INTERVIEW TO DECIDE WHO YOU WANT TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT, FOR YOUR COMMUNITY, FOR YOUR FAMILY, FOR YOUR STATE, OUR COUNTRY, AND, INDEED, THE WORLD. I THINK WHAT TIM SAID REALLY IS WORTH CONSIDERING. DO YOU WANT A ""YOU'RE FIRED"" OR ""YOU'RE HIRED"" PRESIDENT? DO YOU WANT A TRASH TALKER OR A BRIDGE BUILDER? I LIKE THAT ONE A LOT. DO YOU WANT A ME FIRST, FOR KIDS AND FAMILY FIRST? I APPRECIATE TIM LAYING OUT THE CHOICE LIKE THAT. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, MY FRIENDS. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTIONS IN OUR HISTORY, CERTAINLY IN MY LIFETIME, WHERE WE ARE BEING ASKED TO CHOOSE WHETHER WE GO FORWARD INTO OUR FUTURE WITH CONFIDENCE, OPTIMISM, AND HOPE, OR WHETHER WE GIVE IN TO BIGGEST TREE -- BIGOTRY AND BULLYING? AT SOME POINT, THAT WILL BE THE DECISION EVERY VOTER FACES. I AM GRATEFUL TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF LEADERS IN THIS GREAT COMMONWEALTH. YOUR WONDERFUL SENATOR, MARK WARNER, YOUR GOVERNOR, TERRY MCAULIFFE.   IN RECENT YEARS, VIRGINIA HAS HAD DEMOCRATIC OFFICE-HOLDERS WHO HAVE REALLY WORKED TOGETHER TO BUILD THE ECONOMY, TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITY. IT IS A SPECIAL DELIGHT TO BE HERE WITH TIM AND OTHERS WHO HAVE PAVED THE WAY FOR VIRGINIA TO CONTINUE TO PLAY THE IMPORTANT ROLE IN OUR COUNTRY. I HAVE TO SAY I JUST SAW ""HAMILTON,"" A GREAT MUSICAL. I SAW IT FOR THE THIRD TIME, IF YOU DO NOT TELL ANYBODY. AND I HOPE YOU ALL LISTEN TO THE SOUNDTRACK. I HOPE YOU GET TO SEE IT WHEN IT COMES TO WASHINGTON. IT IS GOING TO TRAVEL PROBABLY AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR THE NEXT CENTURY. BUT IT TELLS US SOME IMPORTANT LESSONS. YOU LOOK AT OUR FOUNDERS. VIRGINIA GAVE US A BUNCH OF THEM.   YOU LOOK AT THEM. THEY DID NOT ALL AGREE. THEY DID NOT EVEN ALL LIKE EACH OTHER. BUT HERE IS WHAT THEY DID. THEY WORKED TOGETHER AND THEY SET THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS, UNBELIEVABLE GOAL -- THAT THEY WERE GOING TO TRANSFER THESE COLONIES INTO A NATION THAT COULD STAND ON ITS OWN WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. WHAT AN OUTRAGEOUS IDEA. WHO COULD THINK THAT WOULD COME TO PASS? THERE IS A SONG IN THIS PLAY WHERE GEORGE WASHINGTON, WHO DID SOMETHING NOBODY EXPECTED, HE STEPPED DOWN. HE COULD HAVE STAYED AS THE GREAT REVOLUTIONARY WAR GENERAL WHO FOUGHT FOR AND OBTAINED OUR INDEPENDENCE. HE PROBABLY COULD HAVE STAYED PRESIDENT AS LONG AS HE WAS ALIVE. BUT HE SAID, WAIT A MINUTE. WE ARE A DIFFERENT CREATURE. WE ARE GOING TO GO ABOUT THIS IN A WAY THAT GIVES US REAL CREDENCE TO OUR AIMS. I AM STEPPING DOWN. THERE IS A HILARIOUS SONG BY THE KING OF ENGLAND, WHO CANNOT BELIEVE IT. WHAT IS HE DOING? NOBODY STEPS DOWN. IN STEPPING DOWN, WASHINGTON SAID, THE EYES OF HISTORY ARE ON US. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH SOME HARD TIMES. AS TIM SAID, I WAS IN SPRING FIELD YESTERDAY. THE OLD STATEHOUSE, WHERE ABRAHAM LINCOLN GAVE A SPEECH, REMINDING AMERICANS THAT A HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF CANNOT STAND. WE ARE IN NO WAY FACING THE KIND OF EXISTENTIAL CHALLENGE THAT PRESIDENT LINCOLN FACED. BUT WE ARE FACING SOME OF OUR OWN, AREN'T WE? ARE WE COMING TOGETHER OR FALLING APART? ARE WE BUILDING WALLS OR BRIDGES? ARE WE CREATING OPPORTUNITY TO LIFT EVERYONE UP, OR ARE WE SCAPEGOATING AND FINGER-POINTING AND TRYING TO MARGINALIZE AMERICANS? IF YOU LISTEN TO THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, THAT IS THE CAMPAIGN HE IS RUNNING. EVERYTHING TIM SAID IS ABSOLUTELY ON THE MARK. HERE IS WHAT I AM ASKING ALL OF YOU -- TO THINK HARD ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. YES, WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. WHEN WE SET GOALS FOR AMERICA, WHEN WE LISTEN TO EACH OTHER --   AND I HAVE SET FIVE BIG GOALS. WE NEED MORE GOOD PAYING JOBS. WE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HARD-WORKING AMERICANS. WE NEED TO INVEST IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, OUR ROADS, OUR BRIDGES, OUR TUNNELS, OUR AIRPORTS, OUR ELECTRIC RIDS, OUR WATER SYSTEMS. WE ARE GOING TO BE THAT CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF THE 21ST CENTURY.   UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, WHO THINKS CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX, WE THINK IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT IS SMART, INNOVATIVE PEOPLE IN VIRGINIA CAN ADDRESS BY CREATING NEW BUSINESSES AND JOBS. I WANT TO GROW THE ECONOMY SO THAT WE HAVE GREATER PROSPERITY, AND I PARTICULARLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY THAT ARE NOT AS FORTUNATE AS OTHERS. COAL COUNTRY, INDIAN COUNTRY, INNER-CITY NEIGHBORHOODS. I WANT US ALL TO RISE TOGETHER. THIS IS NOT ABOUT SOME PEOPLE. IT NEEDS TO BE ABOUT ALL OF AMERICA.   WHILE WE GROW TOGETHER, WE WILL BECOME FAIRER, TOO. THAT IS WHY I WANT TO RAISE THE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE, SO PEOPLE WORKING FULL-TIME ARE NOT LEFT IN POVERTY.   I GOT TO TELL YOU, DONALD TRUMP THINKS WAGES ARE TOO HIGH. I HONESTLY DO NOT KNOW WHO HE TALKS TO. WELL, HE DOES SAY THAT HE MOSTLY TALKS TO HIMSELF. THAT IS TRUE. HE WAS ASKED, WHO ARE YOUR ADVISORS ON FOREIGN POLICY, NATIONAL SECURITY? WELL, I MOSTLY CONSULT MYSELF. THIS WOULD BE A GOOD REALITY SHOW. IT IS JUST SO SERIOUS. IT HAS GONE ON AND ON. WE HAVE TO TAKE WHAT HE SAYS THAT FACE VALUE. MAYA ANGELOU SAID, WHEN SOMEONE SHOWS YOU WHO THEY ARE, TO LEAVE THEM -- BELIEVE THEM.   IN ADDITION TO RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE, WE ARE GOING TO DO MORE FOR SMALL BUSINESS, PARTICULARLY WOMEN OWNED AND MINORITY OWNED SMALL BUSINESS. AND YES, I DO BELIEVE IT IS WAY PAST TIME TO GUARANTEE EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN'S WORK.   I HAVE TO TELL YOU. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE -- I KNOW THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO BASICALLY SAY, THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM ANYMORE. WELL, IF YOU HAVE A MOTHER, WIFE, DAUGHTER, OR SISTER NOT BEING PAID EQUALLY, IT IS YOUR PROBLEM. YOUR FAMILIES PROBLEM, AMERICA'S PROBLEM. THE OTHER DAY, THERE WAS THE STORY OF A 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO WENT TO WORK AT A PIZZA RESTAURANT IN KANSAS. SHE WAS REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE IT WAS HER FIRST REAL JOB. I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS, WHEN I HAD MY FIRST REAL JOB. NOT JUST BABYSITTING AND THINGS LIKE THAT. A REAL JOB. SHE GOES AND SHE WORKS. ANOTHER ONE OF THE PEOPLE WORKING IS A BOY SHE KNOWS FROM HIGH SCHOOL, ALSO 17 YEARS OLD. THEY ARE TALKING ONE DAY, AND SHE TELLS HIM HOW HAPPY SHE IS TO BE EARNING EIGHT DOLLARS AN HOUR. HE SAYS, I AM MAKING $8.15 AN HOUR. SHE GOES TO THE MANAGER. SHE GOES, WELL, HE NEVER HAD A JOB LIKE THIS BEFORE. WE ARE THE SAME AGE. WE HAVE THE SAME EDUCATION. SHE HAS BEEN LISTENING TO MY SPEECHES. WHY IS HE MAKING $.15 AN HOUR MORE? THE MANAGER FIRED THEM BOTH. AND THAT IS LEGAL. THAT IS WHY, WHEN I TALK ABOUT EQUAL PAY, IT REALLY REQUIRES THAT WE FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE OF THE SAME EXPERIENCE, SAME EDUCATION, SAME QUALIFICATIONS, ARE BEING PAID THE SAME. WHEN I TALK LIKE THIS, I KNOW DONALD TRUMP GOES, THERE SHE GOES AGAIN. TALKING ABOUT EQUAL PAY. SHE IS PLAYING THE WOMAN CAR.   YES, I SEE YOU WAVING YOUR WOMAN CARD. I LOVE IT. DEAL ME IN. DEAL ME IN. THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT. WHEN I THINK ABOUT YOU'RE HIRED, THAT IS WHAT I WANT US ALL TO BE FOCUSED ON -- CREATING MORE JOBS, RAISING INCOME FOR PEOPLE, BEGINNING TO REDUCE INEQUALITY IN INCOME BY MAKING SURE OUR ECONOMY WORKS FOR EVERYBODY, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. THAT WILL BE MY HIGHEST PRIORITY, AMONG THE VERY FIRST THINGS I DO WHEN I AM YOUR PRESIDENT COME NEXT JANUARY.   NOW, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT ELSE WE HAVE TO DO, BECAUSE I STILL BELIEVE EDUCATION AT PLACES LIKE THIS GREAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE, IS ESSENTIAL TO GROWING THE ECONOMY AND CREATING OPPORTUNITY. I WANT TO MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE.   JUST HERE IN VIRGINIA, THAT WOULD AFFECT 10 8,000 STUDENTS. I FIGURE THE MORE EDUCATION, THE MORE SKILLS THAT PEOPLE GET, AND IT IS NOT JUST YOUNG PEOPLE -- MID-CAREER PEOPLE, PEOPLE CHANGING PATHS, I WANT YOU TO SEE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS YOUR GATEWAY TO A NEW OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF.   AND HERE IS WHAT ELSE I WANT TO DO. I WANT TO MAKE FOUR-YEAR PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES DEBT FREE SO THAT MIDDLE-CLASS AND POOR FAMILIES CAN AFFORD TO GO. ALL ACROSS AMERICA, I HEARD ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO AFFORD TO GO TO COLLEGE, STAY IN COLLEGE, AND GRADUATE. I SAW THIS, OH, YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS TEACHING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS. I MET A LOT OF STUDENTS THAT SCRAPED TOGETHER THE MONEY THEY NEEDED FOR TUITION, BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED. THERE WAS A SICKNESS IN THE FAMILY. THE OLD CAR THEY DROVE BACK AND FORTH TO SCHOOL BROKE DOWN. CHILDCARE ARRANGEMENTS COLLAPSED. AND THEY COULD NOT GO ON. SO WE STARTED SOMETHING CALLED THE ARKANSAS SINGLE-PARENT SCHOLARSHIP FUND, AND WE HAVE NOW PROVIDED EMERGENCY FUNDING FOR MORE THAN 35,000 STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN SCHOOL, GRADUATE FROM SCHOOL.   I WANT US TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SEND OUT THREE MESSAGES. FIRST, WE WANT EVERY CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY TO SUCCEED. THAT IS WHY WE WANT EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND UNIVERSAL PRE-KINDERGARTEN. AND WE WANT GOOD SCHOOLS IN EVERY ZIP CODE IN AMERICA.   AND NUMBER TWO, WE ARE NOT GOING TO TELL EVERY STUDENT, YOU HAVE TO GO TO FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE. IT IS NOT FAIR AND IT IS NOT RIGHT. THERE ARE A LOT OF JOBS OUT THERE THAT REQUIRE SKILLS. WHAT WE WANT IS FOR MORE YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE SUPPORTED AND MENTORED IN GETTING THOSE SKILLS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES, APPRENTICESHIPS, RUN BY LABOR UNIONS AND BUSINESSES.   BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF JOBS, JOBS FROM BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE TO CODING, CREATING NEW APPS. I DO NOT KNOW WHO CREATED POKEMON GO, BUT I WOULD TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET THEM TO HAVE POKEMON GO TO THE POLLS.   AND NUMBER THREE, I DO NOT WANT FAMILY INCOME TO STAND IN THE WAY OF ANY STUDENT SUCCEEDING. AS TIM SAID, AND HIS WONDERFUL WIFE IS THE EDUCATION COMMISSIONER IN VIRGINIA, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT SHE IS WORKING ON TO OPEN THE DOORS OF OPPORTUNITY. SO I GET PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THIS. YOU KNOW, I AM AWARE THAT, EVERY SO OFTEN, THEY WILL SAY, THERE GOES HILLARY CLINTON WITH HER PLANS. SHE HAS A PLAN FOR EVERYTHING.   I DID NOT KNOW YOU COULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND SAY, I HAVE A PLAN. I AM NOT GOING TO TELL YOU. BUT BELIEVE ME, IT IS GREAT. IT IS HUGE. YOU WILL LOVE IT. I DID NOT KNOW YOU COULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND SAY THAT. I THOUGHT WHEN YOU RAN FOR PRESIDENT, I THINK IT IS LIKE A BIG JOB INTERVIEW. YOU OWE IT TO PEOPLE TO TELL THEM WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. AND I THINK IT WILL HELP IF WE ACTUALLY RUN ON AN AGENDA OF WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH SO THAT THE CONGRESS KNOWS AND YOU WILL HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE. WE ARE GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON MAKING EARLY CHILDHOOD, ELEMENTARY, AND SECONDARY EDUCATION, COMMUNITY COLLEGE, TRAINING PROGRAMS, AND FOUR-YEAR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE TO EVERYONE.   AND BY THE WAY, WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU REFINANCE AND PAY DOWN THE DEBT YOU ALREADY HAVE.   PEOPLE SAY TO ME OK, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR IT? WE'RE GOING TO GO WHERE THE MONEY IS. WE ARE GOING TO WHERE THE MONEY IS. THAT MEANS WE ARE GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON THE WEALTHY AND THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD TO PAY THE LIFT UP OUR COUNTRY.   I WANT US TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WEALTHY ARE PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. BECAUSE THAT IS WHO HAS BENEFITED THE MOST. AND EVEN SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION, MOST OF THE WEALTH HAS GONE TO THE TOP COUPLE OF PERCENT OF FOLKS. NOW WE IN AMERICA DO NOT BEGRUDGE SUCCESS. BUT WE ALSO KNOW WE HAVE WORK TO DO HERE, TO GIVE MORE PEOPLE THE CHANCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND THEREFORE, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS KIND OF SUPPORT FOR EDUCATION, THAT IS GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE THE CHANCE TO GO FORWARD. AND THAT WILL REQUIRE RAISING TAXES ON THE WEALTHY. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS, I AM THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO RAN IN EITHER PRIMARY WHO SAID I WILL NOT RAISE TAXES ON THE MIDDLE CLASS. AND I MEAN IT. AND I WILL DO IT.   AND WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TRY TO PROVIDE MORE INCENTIVE SO MORE COMPANIES WILL NOT ONLY CREATE JOBS IN AMERICA, BUT BRING JOBS BACK FROM OVERSEAS, SEVILLE CAN WORK HERE -- SO PEOPLE CAN WORK HERE IN VIRGINIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND FINALLY, WE ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE WAY PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIVE TODAY. YOU KNOW, IT IS NOT THE 1950'S. YOU HAVE TWO PARENTS WORKING, LOTS OF TIMES YOU HAVE ONE PARENT, LOTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE TRYING TO START AND GET AHEAD, AND I DO BELIEVE, AND TIM'S IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ABOUT THIS, THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN SUPPORTING OUR CHILDREN. AND YES, NOW MY GRANDCHILDREN.   SO, I WANT US TO BE WILLING TO LOOK AT THE STRESSES WE ARE PUTTING ON FAMILIES. SOME OF THE MOST OBVIOUS ONES ARE IN THOSE EARLY YEARS WITH A NEWBORN, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO WORK, WHEN YOU HAVE NO PAID SICK DAYS, NO PAID VACATION DAYS, AND YOU HAVE NO PAID FAMILY LEAVE. AND YOU ARE TRYING TO BOND WITH THIS BABY, TRY TO GET THIS BABY FED, TRY TO FIND A SAFE PLACE AND TAKE CARE THIS BABY, SO YOU CAN GO BACK TO WORK TO KEEP A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD. WE MAKE IT JUST ABOUT AS HARD AS ANY PLACE IN THE WORLD FOR FAMILIES TO DO THAT. AND SO, HERE IS WHAT I BELIEVE. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO JOIN THE REST OF THE ADVANCED ECONOMIES AND HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE.  >> HILLARY, HILLARY!  SO, MY FRIENDS, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT CONVENTION IN PHILADELPHIA.   I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN CLEVELAND.   IT IS GOING TO BE -- IT IS GOING TO BE ENTERTAINING I AM SURE. IF YOU ARE INTO BIGOTRY, BLUSTERING. AND YOUR INTO DRAWING LINES BETWEEN AMERICANS. IF YOU ARE INTO INSULTING GROUPS OF AMERICANS. IF YOU'RE INTO SAYING YOU DON'T WANT TO LET MUSLIMS INTO THE COUNTRY. IF YOU WANT TO ROUNDUP AND THE PORT 11 MILLION PEOPLE -- DEPORT 11 MILLION PEOPLE. IF YOU ENJOY SEEING WOMEN DEMEANED. I SPOKE TODAY WITH A DISTINGUISHED LATINO ORGANIZATION. AND SOMETIMES, MY SMART RESEARCH PEOPLE GIVE ME INFORMATION. AND I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE AT FIRST. I GO BACK AND SAY, DID HE REALLY SAY THIS? THEY COME BACK, SHOW ME WHERE HE SAID IT, AND ONE OF HIS MISS UNIVERSE CONTESTS, YOU KNOW HE SAID HE IS QUALIFIED TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF BECAUSE HE TOOK MISS UNIVERSE TO MOSCOW.   AND ANOTHER TIME HE WAS INTRODUCING CONTESTANTS, AND HE INTRODUCED A BEAUTIFUL LATINA WOMAN AS MISS HOUSEKEEPING. REALLY? DOESN'T IT JUST BEGGAR YOUR MIND, WHO SAID THIS? DID HE REALLY SAY THIS? REMEMBER THOUGH, WHEN SOMEONE SHOWS YOU WHO HE IS, BELIEVE HIM. SO, PART OF OUR CHALLENGE, MY FRIENDS, IS TO KEEP THIS CAMPAIGN ABOUT THE FUTURE. KEEP IT ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO TOGETHER. RECOGNIZE WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. WE WILL BE BETTER UNITED, THEN DIVIDED. THAT WE ARE GOING TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT AMERICA HAS ITS BEST DAYS AHEAD OF US. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE EVERY CHILD HAS A CHANCE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND WE ARE GOING FORWARD, NOT ONLY STRONGLY, BUT WITH PRIDE, CONFIDENCE, OPTIMISM, AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. THANK YOU ALL. ","Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton Rally in Annandale, Virginia"

THANK YOU SO MUCH. HELLO, CHARLOTTE.  IT IS SO GREAT TO BE BACK IN NORTH CAROLINA WITH SO MANY FRIENDS.  WITH CONGRESSWOMAN ALMA ADAMS AND CONGRESSMAN DAVID PRYCE AND CONGRESSMAN G.K. BUTTERFIELD AND YOUR NEXT U.S. SENATOR, DEBORAH ROSS.  AND YOUR NEXT GOVERNOR, ROY COOPER.  AND, OF COURSE, WITH OUR PRESIDENT, BARACK OBAMA.  I, I FEEL VERY PRIVILEGED, BECAUSE I'VE KNOWN THE PRESIDENT IN MANY ROLES; AS A COLLEAGUE IN THE SENATE, AS AN OPPONENT IN A HARD-FOUGHT PRIMARY --  AND THE PRESIDENT I WAS SO PROUD TO SERVE AS SECRETARY OF STATE.  BUT I'VE ALSO KNOWN HIM AS THE FRIEND THAT I WAS HONORED TO STAND WITH IN THE GOOD TIMES AND THE HARD TIMES. SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER FORGOTTEN WHERE HE CAME FROM --  AND, DONALD, IF YOU'RE OUT THERE TWEETING, IT'S HAWAII.   SO OVER THE YEARS WE'VE HAD SOME MEMORABLE EXPERIENCES TOGETHER LIKE STORMING A SECRET MEETING OF FOREIGN LEADERS AT A GLOBAL CLIMATE SUMMIT.  HAND, WE'RE GOING TO BUILD ON THE PRESIDENT'S IDEA TO MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE AND WE ARE GOING TO HELP MILLIONS OF PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH EXISTING STUDENT DEBT SAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. THIRD, WE'RE GOING TO REWRITE THE ROLES AND CRACK DOWN ON COMPANIES THAT SHIP JOBS OVERSEAS AND PROFIT TO GO WITH THEM. LET'S REWARD THE COMPANIES THAT SHARE PROFITS WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES INSTEAD. AND, WE ARE GOING TO DEFEND AND STRENGTHEN THE TOUGH REFORMS PRESIDENT OBAMA PUT IN PLACE ON THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY. NOT TEAR THEM UP LIKE DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE WILL DO. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WALL STREET CAN NEVER WRECK MAIN STREET AGAIN. FOURTH, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WALL STREET CORPORATIONS AND THE SUPER-RICH PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES. IT IS JUST PLAIN WRONG THAT'S A MILLIONAIRE CAMPAIGN PAY A LOWER TAX RATE THE END THERE ARE SECRETARIES AND WE'RE GOING TO STOP IT. IN, BY THE WAY, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ASKING TO SEE DONALD TRUMPS TAX RETURNS. AND FINALLY, WE ARE GOING TO STEP OFF AND RESPOND TO THE WAY AMERICAN FAMILIES ACTUALLY LIVE AND WORK IN THE 21ST CENTURY. OUR FAMILIES AND WORK PLACES I HAVE CHANGED, SO ISN'T IT TIME OF OUR POLICIES CHANGE, TOO? DONALD TRUMP CAN ACCUSE ME OF PLAYING THE WOMAN CARD ALL HE WANTS. BUT IF FIGHTING FOR EQUAL PAY AND AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE AND AFFORDABLE LEAVE IS PLAYING THE TRUMP CARD, THEN -- IS PLAYING THE WOMAN CARD, THEN DEAL ME IN.   MOST OF ALTHOUGH, WE ARE GOING TO BUILD ON THE VISION FOR AMERICA THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ALWAYS CHAMPION. A VISION FOR A FUTURE WHERE WE DO GREAT THINGS TOGETHER. NOT AS RED STATES AND BLUE STATES BUT AS THE UNITED STATES.   WHEN I LOOK AT PRESIDENT OBAMA, I SEE A LEADER WITH HEART, DEPTH, IN HUMILITY. SOMEONE WHO, DESPITE THE OF SECTION HE HAS FACED, STILL REACHES FOR COMMON GROUND AND COMMON PURPOSE. NOW, SOME OF YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THAT HE AND I COMPETED AGAINST EACH OTHER AS HARD AS WE COULD BACK IN 2008, BUT WHEN IT WAS OVER I WAS DRAWN TO AN DORSUM AND CAMPAIGN FOR HIM. AND -- I WAS PROUD TO ENDORSE HIM AND CAMPAIGN FOR HIM. AND WHEN HE CALLED ME ASKING TO COME TO CHICAGO, HE WANTED ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE. I DO NOT THINK ANYONE'S ON THAT COMING, ESPECIALLY MEAT. AND AS I TRAVELED, A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD ASK ME HOW PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I COULD WORK TOGETHER SO WELL AFTER BEING SUCH FIERCE COMPETITORS. AND SOME PLACES, YOU KNOW, THE PERSON WHO LOSES AN ELECTION GETS EXECUTED OR EXILED, NOT ASK BE SECRETARY OF STATE. BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA ASKED ME TO SERVE AND I ACCEPTED. DO WANT TO KNOW WHY? WE BOTH LOVE OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS HOW DEMOCRACY IS SUPPOSED TO WORK. WE JUST CELEBRATED 240 YEARS OF OUR INDEPENDENCE. IN AMERICA WE PUT COMMON INTERESTS BEFORE SELF INTERESTS. WE STAND TOGETHER BECAUSE WE KNOW WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. THAT IS THE KIND OF PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA HAS BEEN. HE HAS FACED DIFFICULT, EVEN UNPOPULAR DECISIONS FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY. I HAVE SAT WITH HIM THE SITUATION ROOM IN SEEN HIM MAKE THE HARDEST CHOICES A PRESIDENT FACES. HE DOES IT WITH STEADY, PRINCIPLED LEADERSHIP. HE IS A STATESMAN LEADING NOT JUST OUR COUNTRY BUT THE ENTIRE WORLD. IT WAS HIS VISION AND DIPLOMACY THAT SECURED A HISTORIC GLOBAL AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE. PUT A LID ON THE IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM. OPEN UP CUBA. RALLIED THE WORLD TO CURB THE THREAT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. I SAW HIM GO TOE-TO-10 OH WITH THE TOUGHEST FOREIGN LEADERS AND TO GET THE ORDER TO GO AFTER OF OSAMA BIN LADEN. THIS, MY FRIENDS, IS A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS HOW TO KEEP US SAFE AND STRONG. COMPARE THAT TO DONALD TRUMP.   CAN YOU IMAGINE HIM SITTING IN THE OVAL OFFICE THE NEXT TIME AMERICA FACES A CRISIS? THE WORLD HANGS ON EVERY WORD OUR PRESIDENT SAYS AND DONALD TRUMP IS SIMPLY UNQUALIFIED AND TEMPERAMENTALLY UNFIT TO BE OUR PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. FROM HERE TO NORTH CAROLINA, THIS ELECTION IS OUR CHANCE TO SAY, OUR COUNTRY IS BETTER THE IN THIS. IN AMERICA, WE DO NOT ENTER DOWN. WE LIFT EACH OTHER UP. WE BUILD BRIDGES NOT WALLS. WE DO NOT CALL THE COUNTRY WE LOVE A DISASTER OR A LAUGHING STOCK. WE KNOW AMERICA ALREADY IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH. JUST THINK ABOUT THOSE EARLY PATRIOTS WHO MET IN PHILADELPHIA THAT HOT SUMMER OF 1776. THEY KNEW WE WOULD ALL RISE OR FALL TOGETHER. NOW, NOBODY LOOKS LIKE BARACK OBAMA OR ME WOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED BACK THEN, BUT WE ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE THE STORY OF AMERICA IS THE STORY OF HARD-PHOT HARD-ONE PROGRESS. -- HARD-FOUGHT, HARD-WON PROGRESS.   HISTORY HAS MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION SLOWLY AT TIMES BUT UNMISTAKABLY. AS THE PRESIDENT HAS REMINDED US, THE ARK OF THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS LONG. IT BENDS TO OUR JUSTICE. SO IF YOU BELIEVE ALONG WITH ME AND THE PRESIDENT TO THAT OUR BEST DAYS AS A NATION ARE STILL AHEAD OF US, PLEASE JOIN THIS CAMPAIGN. TAKE OUT YOUR PHONE RIGHT NOW, TAKE OUT YOUR PHONE AND TECHXT JOIN OR GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM AND WE ARE HIRING RIGHT NOW IN NORTH CAROLINA. WE ARE TO WIN THIS STATE WITH YOUR HELP. SO, I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT WE ARE FIRED UP AND READY TO GO. READY TO WIN THIS ELECTION. LEE'S JOIN ME IN WELCOMING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, BARAK OBAMA -- BARACK OBAMA!

I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK ALL  THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE WHO COULDN'T GET IN. THANK YOU FOR COMING IN TODAY. I AM SO DELIGHTED TO BE HERE WITH MY FRIEND AND A GREAT LEADER, SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN . YOU JUST SAW WHY SHE IS  CONSIDERED SO TERRIFIC, SO FORMIDABLE, BECAUSE SHE TELLS IT  LIKE IT IS. I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT INTRODUCTION. MORE IMPORTANTLY I WANT TO THANK  HER FOR FIGHTING EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR FAMILIES LIKE HERS,  FAMILIES LIKE YOURS. AND MILLIONS OF HARD-WORKING  AMERICANS THAT DESERVE TO HAVE  MORE FOLKS ON THEIR SIDE. ELIZABETH AND I CAME OF AGE  AROUND THE SAME TIME. AS YOU HEARD HER TALKING ABOUT  HER PARENT, HER BROTHERS, WE  BELIEVED IN THE AMERICAN DREAM. MY DAD WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN. HE GOT OFF EVERY SINGLE DAY. LOTS OF TIMES MY MOTHER AND MY  BROTHER AND I, THEY PRINT FABRICS AND A LONG WAREHOUSE  WITH A LONG TABLE. IT WAS DARK AND NOT VERY  PLEASANT. IT WAS DECENT HONEST WORK. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO IN AMERICA, THAT IS THE BASIC ARGAN. -- BASIC BARGAIN.  WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE BARGAIN  IS ALIVE AND WELL. ELIZABETH IS LEADING THE FIGHT  TO LIBERATE MILLIONS OF  AMERICANS FROM THE BURDEN OF STUDENT DEBT, AND TO MAKE SURE WASHINGTON NEVER AGAIN PROFITS  OFF OF OUR STUDENTS. SHE AND I AGREE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE MAKING MONEY OFF OF SENDING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO COLLEGE TO GET AN  EDUCATION. AND NO ONE WORKS HARDER TO MAKE  SURE WALL STREET NEVER >> MAINSTREET AGAIN. SHE IS COME UP WITH A LOT OF GREAT IDEAS BUT HERE IS ONE THAT HAS ALREADY MADE A DIFFERENCE. IT IS CALLED THE CONSUMER  FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. IT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A FEW  YEARS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF A  GREAT LEADER FROM OHIO, WHO IS LEADING THE CHARGE. IT HAS ONLY BEEN AROUND A FEW YEARS. BUT IT HAS RETURNED $10.8 BILLION TO 25 MILLION AMERICANS  WHO HAVE BEEN HURT I ILLEGAL FINANCIAL PRACTICES. THAT IS WHAT STANDING UP AND  FIGHTING TO WRITE -- TO WRITE ECONOMIC WRONGS LOOKS LIKE. AND I MUST SAY I DO JUST LOVE TO  SEE HOW SHE GETS UNDER DONALD  TRUMP'S SKIN AS ELIZABETH MADE  CLEAR, DONALD TRUMP APPROVED  EVERY DAY HE IS NOT IN IT FOR  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. ELIZABETH REMINDS US OF THAT. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT  VOTERS IN OHIO UNDERSTAND THIS. TEMPERAMENTALLY UNFIT AND  UNQUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT OF  THE UNITED STATES. SOME OF THE BEST TV SINCE  ELIZABETH CAME TO THE SENATE IS  ACTUALLY ON C-SPAN. IF YOU EVER SEE HER PRESS HER  BANK EXECUTIVE OR REGULATOR FOR ANSWERS, REFUSING TO LET THEM  OFF THE HOOK, SHE IS SPEAKING FOR EVERY FRUSTRATED AMERICAN. WE THANK HER FOR THAT. I AM THRILLED ELIZABETH CAN BE  HERE WITH ME IN THIS GLORIOUS  YOU THE FULL BUILDING THAT HAS  BEEN PUT TO NEW USE AS A MUSEUM. WE WANT TO MAKE THE POINT TOGETHER, THAT WE MUST HAVE AN  ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE  AGAIN, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE  TOP. NOT JUST THE RICH OR THE WELL CONNECTED, EVERYBODY. ONE MIGHT ASK, YES THAT IS WHAT  WE BELIEVE, IT SOUNDS SIMPLE. HONESTLY IT SHOULDN'T BE COMPLICATED, BUT THERE ARE TOO  MANY POLITICIANS AND  CORPORATIONS THAT DON'T AGREE. THEY DON'T EVEN SEEM TO GET IT. BUT YOU DO AND WE DO. AND FOR THE PAST MORE THAN A  YEAR I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING ACROSS OUR COUNTRY MEETING PEOPLE WHO HAVE TOLD ME THEIR  WAGES HAVEN'T BUDGED, EVEN THOUGH THEY SEE EXECUTIVES WHO GIVE THEMSELVES BIG BONUSES. AND DO ASK YOURSELF WAIT A  MINUTE, WHY DID THE RICHEST AMERICANS AND THEY JUST  CORPORATIONS GET AWAY -- RICHEST AMERICANS AND BIGGEST CORPORATIONS GET AWAY? IT'S A GOOD QUESTION, IT DOESN'T  MAKE ANY SENSE, DOESN'T MAKE MORAL SENSE, ECONOMIC STENTS -- ECONOMIC SENSE, HISTORIC SENSE. WHEN MORE TAX BREAKS ARE GIVEN  TO HEDGE FUND BILLIONAIRES INSTEAD OF MAKING INVESTMENT AND  MANUFACTURING CLEAN ENERGY THAT  WILL ACTUALLY CREATE MORE JOBS. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WHEN  CORPORATIONS -- THEIR PROFITS OVERSEAS OR SEND THEM TO INFLUENTIAL SHAREHOLDERS, INSTEAD OF MAKING LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN RAISING WAGES,  TRAINING, AND RESEARCH. OR WHEN GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATURES USE EVERY TRICK IN  THE BOOK TO WEAKEN UNIONS AND MAKE IT HARDER FOR AMERICANS TO ORGANIZE THEMSELVES FOR BETTER  WAGES AND BENEFITS. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. YOU HAVE HEARD OF RIGHT TO WORK  LAWS. THEY ARE WRONG FOR WORKERS AND  WRONG FOR AMERICA. THIS ELECTION IS A CHANCE FOR US  TO MAKE IT RIGHT FOR THE FUTURE. FOR OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS. LET'S MAKE IT RIGHT. LET'S MAKE IT RIGHT FOR HARD-WORKING AMERICANS LIKE -- WHO OWN A SMALL TRUCKING  COMPANY. IT IS A NONSTOP STRUGGLE TO  COMPETE AGAINST THE BIGGER GUYS.  IF WE MAKE SURE SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE STAN HASH GETS THE RIGHT SUPPORT, WE CAN GIVE MORE PEOPLE THE CHANCE TO SUCCEED UNDER THAT  AMERICAN BASIC BARGAIN. LET'S MAKE IT RIGHT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. SHE DREAMED HER WHOLE LIFE OF  GOING TO OHIO UNIVERSITY IN  ATHENS. BUT THE HOUSING CRASH WIPED OUT  HER PARENTS SAVINGS AND THEIR  SMALL BUSINESS. TO GET A COLLEGE DEGREE AT A PUBLIC  , ERIKA AND IT UP $100,000 IN  DEBT. WE HAVE TO GIVE FAMILIES RELIEF. ERICA IS VOLUNTEERING FOR OUR CAMPAIGN AND WORKING TO ELECT DEMOCRATS ACROSS OHIO.  STAN IS VOLUNTEERING WITH US TO BECAUSE HE, LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE ACROSS OHIO AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY, KNOW THAT WE ARE  FIGHTING FOR A BETTER FUTURE. I GOT INTO THIS RACE BECAUSE I WANTED TO EVEN THE ODDS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE ODDS STACKED AGAINST THEM. THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR HALF  MEASURES. TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT  THE TOP, WE HAVE TO GO BIG AND BOLD.  WE NEED TO TAKE THAT  FRUSTRATION, THE FEAR, THE  ANXIETY, AND YES, THE ANGER, AND  AFTER WE HAVE VENTED IT, WE NEED  TO WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE THE  KIND OF CHANGES THAT WILL GIVE EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY OF  BETTER SHOT. LET'S SET FIVE AMBITIOUS GOALS  FOR OUR ECONOMY. THAT BREAKTHROUGH THE DYSFUNCTION IN WASHINGTON AND  MAKE THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN BEST, NEW PAYING JOBS SINCE WORLD WAR II.  LET'S DO WHAT WE MISSED TO DO TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE  PRESIDENT EISENHOWER DID WITH  THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM.  THAT IS WHEN REPUBLICANS USED TO BELIEVE IN BUILDING AMERICA AND  PUTTING AMERICANS TO WORK. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO  AGAIN.  LET'S SET THE GOAL OF MAKING COLLEGE DEBT-FREE FOR EVERYONE, LIKE ERICA.  AND LET'S PROVIDE DEBT RELIEF, LET'S PROVIDE DEBT RELIEF AS  SOON AS WE CAN, AS SOON AS WE  START TO WORK, ELIZABETH. WILL TAKE THE DAY OFF FOR THE  INAUGURATION AND THEN THE SENATE  AND WHITE HOUSE AND CONGRESS  WILL GET TO WORK.  NOW, WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO, SO LET'S SET THE GOAL OF REWRITING THE RULES SO MORE COMPANIES  SHARE PROFITS WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES, NOT JUST THEIR  EXECUTIVES.  INSTEAD OF SHIPPING PROFITS AS A ND JOBS OVERSEAS, WE HAVE  THE GREATEST COUNTRY AND ECONOMY  IN THE WORLD, LET'S START ACTING LIKE IT AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT  COMPANIES HAVE TO BE PART OF  THAT GREATNESS.  AND LET'S SET THE GOAL OF MAKING  SURE WALL STREET AND THE WEALTHY  PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES. NOW, THERE ARE A COUPLE OF WAYS TO DO THIS, I HAVE BEEN PROPOSING A FEW OF  THEM. NO MILLIONAIRE SHOULD PAY A  LOWER TAX RATE THAN SOMEONE  WORKING FOR THEM, LIKE A  SECRETARY.  THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROFITED THE MOST, EVEN SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION, ARE PEOPLE WHO NOW  NEED TO GIVE BACK. THIS COUNTRY HAS GIVEN SO MUCH  TO ALL OF US AND EVERYBODY  SHOULD SHARE THE BURDEN.  I HAVE MADE A PLEDGE. I WILL NOT RAISE TAXES ON THE MIDDLE CLASS, THE WE ARE GOING  TO RAISE TAXES ON CORPORATIONS AND THE WEALTHY.  AND DON'T YOU THINK IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT WE PUT AMERICAN FAMILIES FIRST? WE ARE NOT  LIVING IN THE 1950'S OR 1960'S  ANYMORE. WE HAVE TO CATCH UP TO HOW AMERICANS ACTUALLY LIVE AND WORK  IN THE 21ST CENTURY. I HAVE MET SO MANY STRESSED-OUT YOUNG PARENTS. I HAVE MET SO MANY STRESSED-OUT MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER FOLKS, THEY ARE TRYING TO BALANCE WHAT SHOULD BE THE JOY OF THEIR  LIVES, LIKE OUR NEW GRANDSON IS FOR US AND OUR GRANDDAUGHTER.  I REMEMBER -- I WAS TALKING TO  ELIZABETH ON THE PHONE WHEN SHE  WAS VISITING HER FAMILY, HER GRANDCHILDREN, AND WE TALKED  ABOUT ALL THIS IMPORTANT STUFF  AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IT SHE SAID, I HAVE TO GO BECAUSE I  NEED TO BUY MY GRANDDAUGHTER SOME SPARKLY SHOES.  THERE IS NO GREATER JOY BUT TO  SEE YOUNG PARENTS STRUGGLING SO HARD, AND TO SEE OLDER PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF THEIR PARENTS, WE  HAVE WORK TO DO. WE SHOULD NOT MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT TO DO YOUR JOB AT HOME  AND TO DO THE JOB THAT PUTS FOOD  ON THE TABLE AND A ROOF OVER  YOUR HEAD. LET ME SAY A WORD ABOUT  REWRITING THE RULES.  THERE ARE A LOT OF BUSINESSES THRIVING RIGHT HERE IN OHIO WHO  SEE THEIR EMPLOYEES THE RIGHT WAY.  THEY SEE THEM AS ASSETS TO  INVEST IN, NOT COSTS TO CUT.  BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE TOO MANY WHO TAKE THE OPPOSITE VIEW AND THEIR BEHAVIOR CONTRIBUTES TO STAGNANT WAGES AND LOWER  ECONOMIC GROWTH. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL WORK TO  REWARD COMPANIES THAT SHARE  PROFITS WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES, ON  TOP OF PAYING A GOOD WAGE. IF THEY CAN DO IT FOR THEIR EXECUTIVES, THEY SURE CAN DO IT  FOR THEIR WORKERS.  AND WE WILL ENCOURAGE COMPANIES TO INVEST IN WORKER TRAINING AND  TO BUILD HIGH-QUALITY  APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WHERE  YOU EARN WHILE YOU LEARN, AND WE  WILL STRENGTHEN UNIONS, BECAUSE  THEY ARE THE BEDROCK OF A STRONG MIDDLE CLASS IN AMERICA.  UNIONS HELPED BRING BACK THE  AUTO INDUSTRY IN OHIO AND THEY WILL HELP BRING BACK AMERICA FROM COAST TO COAST. SO HERE IS OUR MESSAGE.  HERE IS OUR MESSAGE TO EVERY CORPORATE BOARDROOM. DO THE RIGHT THING, BY YOUR  EMPLOYEES AND YOUR COUNTRY, AND  WE WILL STAND BY YOU. BUT CHEAT YOUR EMPLOYEES, EXPLOITS YOUR CUSTOMERS, POLLUTE OUR ENVIRONMENT, OR RIP OFF  TAXPAYERS, AND WE WILL HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE.  BECAUSE WHEN COMPANIES TAKE TAXPAYER DOLLARS IF ONE HAND AND  GIVE OUT PINK SLIPS WITH THE OTHER AND SHIP HUNDREDS OF JOBS OVERSEAS, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE  THEM PAY BACK THOSE TAX BENEFITS AND WE ARE TO TAKE THAT MONEY AND REINVEST IT IN WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES AND WE ARE GOING TO  SLAP AN EXIT TAX ON COMPANIES THAT MOVE THEIR COMPANIES OVERSEAS TO AVOID PAYING THEIR  FAIR SHARE OF TAXES.  WE WILL DEFEND AMERICAN JOBS AND AMERICAN WORKERS BY SAYING NO TO BAD TRADE DEALS LIKE THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP AND UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES LIKE WHEN CHINA DUMPS CHEAP STEEL IN OUR  MARKETS OR USES WEAK RULES OF ORIGIN TO UNDERCUT OUR  CARMAKERS. I AM GOING TO APPOINT A TRADE  PROSECUTOR WHO WILL REPORT TO  THE PRESIDENT SO WE ARE GOING TO  END THE ABUSE OF OUR MARKETS,  OUR WORKERS, OUR PEOPLE.  AND YOU KNOW WHAT, WE ARE GOING  TO COMPETE AND WIN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. BY NOT LETTING ANYBODY TAKING ADVANTAGE -- TAKE ADVANTAGE OF  OUR WORKERS, NOT CHINA, NOT WALL  STREET, NOT ANYONE. WE ARE GOING TO DEFEND THE RULES  TO REIN IN WALL STREET PUT AFTER  THE CRASH. FINES SHOULD CUT INTO  EXECUTIVES BONUSES.  AND IF LAWS ARE VIOLATED INDIVIDUALS, NOT JUST  CORPORATIONS, SHOULD BE HELD  ACCOUNTABLE.  AND I WILL VETO, I WILL VETO ANY  EFFORT TO WEAKEN PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS. WHILE WE'RE AT IT, WE ARE GOING TO FINALLY MAKE WALL STREET, BIG  CORPORATIONS, AND THE SUPER WEALTHY DO MORE THAN WHAT IS FAIR IN PAYING TAXES, BUT WHAT IS RIGHT. WE CAN USE THAT MONEY, TO MAKE THESE BIG, BOLD INVESTMENTS THAT  HELP US BRING AND-- BUILD A  STRONG ECONOMY.  IT IS GOOD NOT JUST FOR FAMILIES  AND WORKERS, IT IS GOOD FOR  COMPANIES. THE MORE MONEY YOU HAVE IN YOUR  POCKET THAT YOU CAN SPEND, THE  BETTER THAT IS FOR THE ECONOMY. THE WAY THINGS ARE FOR RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE ARE AFRAID AND ARE  HOLDING BACK.  WE HAVE TO LIBERATE THE AMERICAN CONSUMER BY PROTECTING THE AMERICAN WORKER. WE WILL ENSURE WE HAVE THE MOST  COMPETITIVE AUTO AND AUTO PARTS  INDUSTRY IN THE WORLD.  AND WHEN WE INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE, WE ARE NOT JUST  GOING TO INVEST IN ROADS AND BRIDGES AND TUNNELS AND PORTS  AND TRANSIT AND WATER SYSTEMS. WE ARE GOING TO CONNECT EVERY HOME TO HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND SO  THEY CAN GET INTO THE GLOBAL  MARKETPLACE.  AND WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE BY MAKING AMERICA  THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF  THE 21ST CENTURY.  AND I WANT TO COMPLEMENT YOUR MAYOR WHO IS HERE, YOUR STATE  REPRESENTATIVE, ALICIA READ, CINCINNATI IS ALREADY ONE OF THE  BIGGEST CITIES IN THE COUNTRY TO  RUN 100% ON CLEAN ENERGIES. CONGRATULATIONS.  AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, MAYOR, I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING THAT IF YOU CAN DO IT IN CINCINNATI, YOU CAN DO IT ANYWHERE, THAT IS WHAT WE NEED  IN AMERICA.  WE ARE GOING TO RAISE THE  NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE SEVEN , WORKERS DESERVE BETTER. FAMILIES DESERVE REAL SUPPORT  LIKE QUALITY AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE, PAID FAMILY LEAVE, AND EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN.   NOW, I KNOW WHEN I TALK ABOUT  THESE THINGS, DONALD TRUMP SAYS,  I AM PLAYING THE WOMAN CARD.  I WILL TO YOU WHAT, IF FIGHTING  FOR FAMILIES IS PLAYING THE  WOMAN CARD, THE ONLY -- DEAL ME IN.      WE HAVE TO GO  AND END THE POLITICAL DYSFUNCTION THAT IS HOLDING OUR  COUNTRY AND ECONOMY BACK. LET'S OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED AND GET UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY OUT  OF POLITICS.   LET'S SHUT OFF THE REVOLVING DOOR IN WASHINGTON AND MAKE SURE THE FOXES ARE NOT GUARDING THE  HEN HOUSE.    AND LET'S LEARN HOW TO LISTEN TO EACH OTHER AND  WORK TOGETHER AGAIN.  I AM DETERMINED TO BREAK THROUGH THE DEADLOCK AND GET THINGS DONE  FOR FOR WORKING FAMILIES. I KNOW REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS CAN WORK TOGETHER.  I KNOW BECAUSE I HAVE DONE IT.  I CREATED THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE NETWORK WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.  I WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS AND  DEMOCRATS TO BRING JOBS BACK TO  UPSTATE NEW YORK AND HELP NEW YORK REBUILD AND HEAL AFTER  9/11. I DID NOT JUST REPRESENT  DEMOCRATS AS SECRETARY OF STATE,  I REPRESENTED ALL AMERICANS, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT --   WE ARE ALL ON THE SAME TEAM. IT IS TIME WE STARTED TO ACT  LIKE IT. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE IF WE DO. NOW, I CONFESS, I CONFESS, IT IS  TRUE, I CAN BE A LITTLE WONKY.  I HAVE AN OLD-FASHIONED IDEA. IF YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, YOU SHOULD SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO  DO AND HOW YOU WILL GET IT DONE.   SO NOW, NOW THAT YOU HAVE HEARD  SOME OF MY PLANS FOR THE ECONOMY, ASK YOURSELF, WHAT ARE  DONALD TRUMP'S PLANS? BEST I CAN TELL IS HE HAS NO  CREDIBLE STRATEGY FOR CREATING JOBS AND MAYBE WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT BETTER FROM SOMEONE WHOSE  MOST FAMOUS WORDS ARE "" YOU'RE FIRED. """" HE RAILED AGAINST OTHER COUNTRIES. TRUMP'S OWN PRODUCTS ARE MADE IN  COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT NAMED AMERICA. TRUMP'S SUITS WERE MADE IN  MEXICO. HE COULD'VE HAD THE MADE IN BROOKLYN, OHIO. TRUMP'S FURNITURE IS MADE IN  TURKEY, INSTEAD OF CLEVELAND. TRUMP'S BAR WHERE IS MADE IN  SLOVENIA INSTEAD OF TOLEDO. HOW DOES THAT FIT INTO HIS TALK  ABOUT AMERICA FIRST?  THAT IS JUST THE START. THIS IS A MAN WHO PLAYS COY WITH  WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND MOCKS  PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, WHO  TALKS ABOUT BANNING AN ENTIRE RELIGION FROM ENTERING OUR COUNTRY, WHO ADVOCATES OF  GETTING RID OF GUN FREE ZONE S IN SCHOOLS, LETTING MORE COUNTRIES HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS,  DEFAULTING ON NATIONAL DEBT,  TURNING BACK THE CLOCK ON  MARRIAGE EQUALITY. JUST LIKE ELIZABETH, I CAN GO ON  AND ON. THIS IS SOMEONE WHOSE REACTION TO THE HORRIFIC MASS SHOOTING IN ORLANDO WAS TO PUBLICLY CONGRATULATE HIMSELF. AND ON FRIDAY, WHEN BRITAIN  VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN  UNION, HE CROWED ABOUT HOW THE DISRUPTION WOULD END UP CREATING  HIGHER PROFITS FOR HIS GOLF COURSE, EVEN THOUGH WITHIN 24  HOURS, AMERICANS LOST $100 BILLION FROM OUR 41 401S. IMAGINE DONALD TRUMP SITTING IN  THE OVAL OFFICE THE NEXT TIME  AMERICA FACES A CRISIS.  IMAGINE HIM BEING IN CHARGE WHEN YOUR JOBS  AND SAVINGS ARE INAT STAKE.  IMAGINE HIM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF AN  EMERGENCY. SO IT IS NO WONDER, IS IT? THAT RISK ANALYSTS LISTED A DONALD  TRUMP PRESIDENCY AS ONE OF THE TOP THREATS FACING THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, AHEAD OF TERRORISM. WELL, WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET  DONALD TRUMP BANKRUPT AMERICA THE WAY HE BANKRUPTED HIS  CASINOS.   WE NEED TO WRITE A NEW CHAPTER IN THE AMERICAN DREAM AND IT  CANNOT BE CHAPTER 11.   IF YOU BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP IS WRONG FOR AMERICA AND OUR BEST  DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US, PLEASE, JOIN US IN THIS CAMPAIGN.  WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER, WE ARE  STRONGER WHEN WE GROW TOGETHER,  WHEN WE LIFT EACH OTHER UP, WHEN  OUR ECONOMY IS WORKING FOR  EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP AIRED LET'S GET TO WORK  OHIO. LET'S KNOCK ON DOORS AND  REGISTER VOTERS. LET'S SEND ALICIA REED BACK TO  COLUMBUS. LET'S GET STRONG PROGRESSIVE  LEADERS LIKE SENATOR WARREN IN WASHINGTON. LET'S TAKE OUR COUNTRY IN THE  RIGHT DIRECTION WITH CONFIDENCE  AND OPTIMISM. THAT IS WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. THANK YOU, OHIO. GOD BLESS YOU.   ","Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally in Cincinnati, Ohio"

THANK YOU SO MUCH. I AM ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU AMONG SO MANY FRIENDS. A LOT OF THE MAYORS HERE HAVE BEEN LABORING IN THE VINEYARDS OF YOUR CITIES AND YOUR STATES, AND WORKING TO PROVIDE BETTER LIVES FOR THE PEOPLE YOU REPRESENT, AND ONLY AMERICA'S MAYORS COULD FIND A WAY TO PUT LADY GAGA AND THE DALAI LAMA ON THE SAME PROGRAM.   I AM REALLY IMPRESSED BY THAT. I WANT TO THANK YOUR PRESIDENT, MAYOR STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-BLAKE, FOR HER LEADERSHIP OF THIS ORGANIZATION.   IT IS ALWAYS GREAT BEING A WOMAN SERVING AS PRESIDENT.    AND I WANT TO --     I WANT TO ADD A SPECIAL WORD OF GREETING. STEPHANIE TOLD ME THAT HER MOTHER, DR. RAWLINGS, IS HERE, AND I AM KIND OF PARTIAL TO MOTHER SHOWING UP TO SEE EVEN THEIR GROWN-UP SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF FORM FUNCTIONS WITH SUCH GRACE AND DIGNITY, SO DR. BROLIN'S RAWLINGS, CONGRATULATIONS TO  AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGED HER NEXT PRESIDENT. I HAVE FOLLOWED WITH GREAT INTEREST YOUR CREATIVE IDEAS IN OKLAHOMA CITY, AND I REALLY LOOK FOR IT TO YOUR LEADERSHIP OF THIS ORGANIZATION, MAYOR. AND THANKS TO A LONGTIME FRIEND, THE MAYOR OF INDIANAPOLIS HOSTING US HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.    AS I'M SURE YOU HAVE ALREADY REALIZE, HE COMES IN WITH SO MUCH ENERGY AND NEW IDEAS, AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP OF THIS GREAT AMERICAN CITY. BEFORE I BEGIN ADDRESSING SOME OF OUR COMMON ISSUES AND CHALLENGES I WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN HAPPENING IN BRITAIN. A LOT OF AMERICANS WOKE UP ON FRIDAY TO ALARMING HEADLINES FROM ACROSS THE ATLANTIC. AND THEY ARE WONDERING WHAT THIS DECISION IN BRITAIN MEANS FOR US. I AM SURE THAT EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM WITH RETIREMENT SAVINGS ASKS THE SAME QUESTIONS. IN THE DAY AFTER THE VOTE, AMERICANS LOST $100 BILLION FROM OUR 401S. NOW WE ARE RESILIENT AND WE WILL BOUNCE BACK FROM THIS AND FROM ALL OF THE OTHER SHOCKS THAT ARE IN THE SYSTEM, BUT IT IS A REMINDER THAT WHAT HAPPENS AROUND THE WORLD HAS CONSEQUENCES THAT CAN HIT HOME QUICKLY AND AFFECT OUR LIVES AND OUR LIVELIHOOD. OUR PRIORITY NOW MUST BE TO PROTECT AMERICAN FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES FROM THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THIS KIND OF TOMORROW -- UNCERTAINTY. THAT'S WHY EXPERIENCED LEADERSHIP IS SO IMPORTANT AT TIMES LIKE THESE. WE NEED LEADERS LIKE YOURSELVES AT THE LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL LEVEL WHO UNDERSTAND HOW TO WORK WITH OTHER LEADERS, TO MANAGE RISKS, WHO UNDERSTAND THAT BOMBASTIC COMMENTS IN TURBULENT TIMES CAN ACTUALLY CAUSE MORE TURBULENCE, AND WHO PUT THE INTEREST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AHEAD OF THEIR PERSONAL BUSINESS INTERESTS.   WE NEED LEADERS WHO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR ALLIANCES AND PARTNERSHIPS ARE AMONG OUR GREATEST NATIONAL ASSETS, NOW MORE THAN EVER. WORKING WITH OUR ALLIES HAS BEEN A CORNERSTONE OF AMERICAN FOREIGN-POLICY UNDER DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE BECAUSE IT MAKES AMERICA SAFER AND MORE PROSPEROUS, AND IT SHOULD CONTINUE TO GUIDE US NOW. WE HAVE GOT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS, NO ONE SHOULD BE CONFUSED ABOUT AMERICA'S COMMITMENT TO EUROPE, NOT AN AUTOCRAT IN THE KREMLIN, NOT A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ON A SCOTTISH GOLF COURSE. WE HAVE TO REAFFIRM THAT THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM ARE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IN MANY IMPORTANT WAYS, ECONOMICALLY, POLITICALLY, DEMOGRAPHICALLY, BUT WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF COMMON INTERESTS AND VALUES. JUST IF WE HAVE SEEN THAT THERE ARE MANY FRUSTRATED PEOPLE IN BRITAIN, WE KNOW THERE ARE FRUSTRATED PEOPLE HERE AT HOME, TOO. I HAVE SEEN IT. I HAVE HEARD IT. I KNOW IT. THAT IS WHY I HAVE WORKED HARD TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES WE FACE. IT IS WHY I HAVE PUT FORWARD REAL PLANS TO CREATE GOOD PAYING JOBS, RAISE WAGES, REDUCE STUDENT DEBT, BRING DOWN COSTS FOR COLLEGE AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, AND SO MUCH ELSE. PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA NOKNOW THAT THEY DON'T WANT INTI PROMISES. THEY WANT SOLUTIONS. AND THAT IS WHAT I HOPE WORKING WITH YOU THAT I CAN OFFER THEM.   A BIG REASON WHY OUR ECONOMY IS NOT WORKING FOR EVERYONE THE WAY IT SHOULD IS BECAUSE OF POLITICAL DYSFUNCTION. WE HAVE GOT TO GET WASHINGTON M WORKING AGAIN.   JUST AS I HAVE HEARD MANY MAYORS SAY THERE IS NOT A DEMOCRATIC A REPUBLICAN WAY TO PLOW SNOW OR CREATE MORE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES, WE DO WHAT WORKS. WE DO WHAT WE NEED TO TO SERVE OUR PEOPLE. THAT MEANS THE WORK YOU ARE DOING AND THE SOLUTIONS YOU ARE PIONEERING IN AMERICA'S CITIES ARE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. WE ARE ALL, AND ESPECIALLY ME, COUNTING ON YOU, OUR MAYORS, TO GET STUFF DONE. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I WANTED TO BE HERE TODAY. IT IS A SPECIAL PERSONAL HONOR TO FOLLOW TO THE PODIUM A MAN WHO HAS SHOWN EXTRAORDINARY LEADERSHIP IN RECENT WEEKS, ORLANDO MAYOR BUDDY DYER.   LIKE SO MANY OF YOU, I WATCHED THOSE PRESS CONFERENCES COMING FROM ORLANDO, AND I WATCH THE MAYOR BEING VERY COLLECTED, VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING, WHAT HE KNEW AND WHAT HE DIDN'T KNOW, BUT WITH THE OVERRIDING MESSAGE THAT HIS CITY, THE CITY HE LOVES AND SERVES, WILL PERSEVERE. MAYOR DYER, KNOW THAT OUR HEARTS ARE WITH YOU, THE PEOPLE OF YOUR CITY. THE ATTACK AND ORLANDO WAS THE WORST MASS SHOOTING IN AMERICAN HISTORY. SADLY SEVERAL MAYORS HERE TODAY HAVE HAD TO RESPOND TO SIMILAR TRAGEDIES THAT INCLUDED MASS SHOOTINGS OR, IN YOUR CASE, A HORRIFIC BOMB EXPLOSION. WHEN I WAS LAST WITH THE MAYORS AT THE CONFERENCE LAST YEAR, IT WAS JUST DAYS AFTER THE MASSACRE AND CHARLESTON. THERE ARE MORE MASS SHOOTINGS IN THE UNITED STATES THAN IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. IT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE. I DO NOT THINK AMERICANS ARE MORE VIOLENT, WORSE HUMAN BEINGS . I BELIEVE THAT WE CANNOT ACCEPT THIS, NOT NOW AND NOT EVER. AS CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS SAID A FEW DAYS AGO, HOW MANY MORE MOTHERS, HOW MANY MORE FATHERS, NEED TO SHED TEARS OF GRIEF BEFORE WE DO SOMETHING? NO PERSON SHOULD BE GUNNED DOWN WHILE LEARNING, TEACHING, PRAYING, OR DANCING. IT IS TIME FOR US TO COME TOGETHER TO STRENGTHEN OUR GUN LAWS AND KEEP DANGEROUS WEAPONS OUT OF THE HANDS OF DANGEROUS PEOPLE.   AND HERE IS WHAT I KNOW, I KNOW WE CAN RESPECT THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND MAKE COMMON SENSE REFORMS. YET CONGRESS IS PARALYZED, NOT A FILIBUSTER IN THE SENATE, NOT A SIT IN IN THE HOUSE, COULD CONVINCE THE LEADERSHIP TO MOVE FORWARD. I REALLY BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER. IN FACT, EVERY SURVEY I HAVE LOOKED AT SHOWS THAT THERE IS A VERY BIG MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WHO FAVOR THIS PATH, AND A CONSIDERABLE MAJORITY OF GUN OWNERS WHO AGREE. OF COURSE, IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT GUNS. LEADERS IN CONGRESS REFUSED TO ACT ON A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES THAT REALLY MATTER TO AMERICAN WORKING FAMILIES. LAST WEEK'S SPLIT SUPREME COURT RULING ON IMMIGRATION COULD LEAD TO THE TEARING APART AND THE PORTING OF -- DEPORTING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, BREAKING UP FAMILIES. IT WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED, I BELIEVE, IF CONGRESS HAD DONE ITS JOB AND TASK A PRINCE OF IMMIGRATION REFORM. REMEMBER, WE HAD A BIPARTISAN BILL THAT PASSED THE SENATE. THE HOUSE LEADERSHIP WOULD NOT LET IT COME TO THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE. I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT THEY DID NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE PLAYING TO THE LOUDEST VOICES INSTEAD OF THE MOST PEOPLE, BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT WOULD HAVE PASSED OF THE HOUSE IF THERE HAD BEEN A CHANCE TO VOTE ON IT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN THE SENATE, SENATORS HAVE NOT DONE THEIR JOB AND HELD A HEARING FOR JUDGE MERRICK GARLAND, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NOMINEE FOR THE SUPREME COURT.   AND I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW JUDGE GARLAND, WHO IS QUALIFIED, RESPECTED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE -- I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW HE WOULD HAVE VOTED. I WOULD NOT PRETEND TO PRESUME THAT. BUT, WE HAVE NEVER HAD A SITUATION LIKE THIS. , WHERE WE LOSE A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT, WHERE THE PRESIDENT IN MY VIEW IS OBLIGATED UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION TO NOMINATE A SUCCESSOR, AND WHERE THESE SENATE FLAT-OUT REFUSES EVEN TO HOLD A HEARING TO CONSIDER IT. THEY COULD VOTE DOWN JUDGE GARLAND, BUT INSTEAD THEY REFUSE TO ACT. I THINK THAT IS PART OF WHAT IS DRIVING THE FRUSTRATION ON THE PART OF SO MANY AMERICANS. LET'S HAVE A VOTE. WE ARE A DEMOCRACY. EITHER VOTE SOMEBODY OUT FOR VOTE SOMEBODY DOWN, EITHER VOTE UP GUNS OR BOTH AND DOWN  .  .   CONTRAST THAT WITH WHAT YOU DO EVERY DAY, SHOW UP. WE SHOULD EXPECT NOTHING LESS FROM THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, AND I AM SURE THAT MANY OF YOU --    -- REGARDLESS OF PARTY AFFILIATION, SOME ARE REPUBLICANS, SOME ARE DEMOCRATS, AND SOME IN YOUR SYSTEMS ARE NONPARTISAN, NONAFFILIATED. I'M SURE THAT MANY OF YOU ARE RUNNING OUT OF PATIENCE. WHEN YOU LOOK TO WASHINGTON FOR PREDICTABILITY FOR DECISIONS, MAY BE SMART INVESTMENTS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING, SCHOOLS, AND TRANSPORTATION, YOU DON'T GET THE HELP YOU SEEK. INSTEAD, LIKE OTHER AMERICANS, UC GRANDSTANDING -- YOU SEE GRANDSTANDING, YOU HEAR HEAR THREATS TO SHUT DOWN OUR GOVERNMENT. INSTEAD OF SOLVING OUR PROBLEMS, WASHINGTON IS TOO OFTEN MAKING THEM WORSE. MAKE NO MISTAKE, THERE ARE STILL MANY PASSIONATE, COMMITTED PEOPLE IN CONGRESS FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT EVERY DAY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. I WAS PRIVILEGED TO SERVE IN THE SENATE FOR EIGHT YEARS. SOME OF THAT TIME I WAS IN THE MAJORITY, AND SOME OF THAT TIME I WAS IN THE MINORITY, BUT I GOT UP EVERY DAY LOOKING FOR WAYS TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN FOR THE PEOPLE I REPRESENTED, AND THAT WAS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AFTER 9/11, WHERE I NEEDED TO MAKE THE CASE ABOUT REBUILDING NEW YORK, HELPING THE FAMILIES WHOSE LOVED ONES HAD BEEN MURDERED ON THAT TERRIBLE DAY. SO I KNOW THAT WE CAN BUILD RELATIONSHIPS AND FIND COMMON GROUND. I TAKE INSPIRATION FROM THOSE WHO GET UP EVERY DAY IN THE CONGRESS AND KEEP WORKING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. THEY DON'T GET CYNICAL, AND THEY DON'T GIVE UP. JUST LIKE YOU, YOU ARE ON THE FRONT LINES EVERY DAY AS WELL. THE PEOPLE YOU SERVE ARE MORE THAN JUST YOUR VOTERS. THEY ARE YOUR NEIGHBORS. YOU SEE THEM IN THE SUPERMARKET. YOU SEE THEM WHEN YOU WORSHIP. YOU SEE THEM AT YOUR KIDS GAMES. YOU SEE THEM. THEY TELL YOU THEIR PROBLEMS AND IDEAS, AND THEY COUNT ON YOU TO HELP MOVE YOUR CITY FORWARD. YOU CAN'T RESPOND WITH A SNARKY TWEET. YOU HAVE ACTUALLY GOT TO DELIVER RESULTS BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU WILL SEE THEM AT THE SUPERMARKET AND ETTRICK KIDS BALLGAMES, AND EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE CITY. -- AND AT YOUR KIDS BALLGAMES, AND EVERYWHERE ELSE  THAT IS WHY IT CITIES ARE WHERE THINGS ARE HAPPENING AND GETTING DONE. I WANT TO THANK YOU. YOU'RE TAKING THE LEAD IN INVESTING IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION, CURBING CARBON ADMISSIONS, ENDING VETERANS HOMELESSNESS.   IMPLEMENTING INNOVATIVE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS THAT CONNECT AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO JOB OPPORTUNITIES, AND SO MUCH MORE. SOME EXPERTS HAVE ACTUALLY SAID THAT THIS COULD BE THE DECADE OF THE CITY, BECAUSE OUR URBAN AREAS ARE GROWING TWICE AS FAST AS THEY WERE IN THE LAST DECADE. CITIES ARE THE MAJOR REASON WHY OUR COUNTRY HAS COME BACK FROM THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION WITH MORE THAN 14 MILLION PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS CREATED OVER THE LAST SIX AND A HALF YEARS, SAID YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED, AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MORE WE HAVE TO DO. YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE ALREADY WORKING HARDER AND LONGER JUST TO KEEP THEIR HEADS ABOVE WATER. TOO MANY OF OUR URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS ARE PLAGUED BY POVERTY THAT PERSISTS FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR STILL FACE BARRIERS OF SYSTEMIC RACISM, WAGES ARE STILL TOO LOW AND INEQUALITY IS TOO GREAT. JOBS IN MANY PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY ARE BOOMING, AND IN OTHER PARTS, THEY ARE STILL TOO HARD TO COME BY. SO THESE CHALLENGES ARE SERIOUS, BUT YOU GIVE ME HOPE THAT TOGETHER WE CAN OVERCOME THEM. I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART THAT OUR NATION IS AT OUR BEST WHEN WE ARE RISING TOGETHER, WHEN THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT AND LEFT BEHIND GET A FAIR CHANCE TO LIFT THEMSELVES UP, AND THAT'S WHEN COMMUNITIES, CITIES, AND REGIONS GROW STRONGER, AND OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY IS BETTER OFF. LAST WEEK IN NORTH CAROLINA, I LAID OUT A FIVE STEP PLAN TO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. FIRST, WITHIN MY FIRST 100 DAYS AS PRESIDENT, I WILL WORK WITH BOTH PARTIES TO PASS THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT AND JOB CREATION SINCE WORLD WAR II. THIS WILL BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR AMERICA'S CITIES. SECOND, LET'S MAKE COLLEGE DEBT FREE FOR ALL AND TRANSFORM THE WAY WE PREPARE AMERICANS FOR THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE. THIRD, LET'S REWRITE THE RULES SO MORE COMPANIES SHARE PROFITS WITH EMPLOYEES AND FEWER SHIP PROFITS AND JOBS OVERSEAS. AND FOURTH, LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WALL STREET CORPORATIONS AND THE SUPERRICH PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES. AND FIFTH, LET'S PUT FAMILIES FIRST AND MATCH OUR POLICIES TO HOW FAMILIES ACTUALLY LIVE AND WORK IN THE 21ST CENTURY. FOCUSING FOR A MINUTE ON JOBS, I HAVE THIS OLD-FASHIONED BELIEF THAT ANYONE WILLING TO WORK HARD IN AMERICA SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND A GOOD JOB THAT PAYS ENOUGH TO SUPPORT A MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE AND A JOB THAT PROVIDES DIGNITY AND PRIDE. THE HEART OF MY PLAN WILL BE A BIG COMMITMENT TO INFRASTRUCTURE , AIDED BY --    AND THE PUBLIC INVESTMENT WILL BE AIDED BY A NEW NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE BANK THAT WILL BRING PRIVATE SECTOR DOLLARS OFF THE SIDELINES AND BE PUT TO WORK IN REBUILDING AMERICA. WE WILL SET SOME BIG, AMBITIOUS GOALS. I HAVE TO SAY THAT WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MY PARENTS JUST DRILLED AND ME WAS NOT ONLY LOVING MY COUNTRY, BUT THAT WE COULD DO ANYTHING THAT WE SET OUR MINDS TO, ANYTHING, BECAUSE WE WERE AMERICANS. WELL, LET'S SET SOME GOALS AGAIN AND HOLD EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACHIEVING THEM, LIKE CONNECTING EVERY HOUSEHOLD TO BROADBAND BY THE YEAR 2020.   IF YOU HAVE LIKE I HAVE TRAVELED ACROSS OUR COUNTRY, YOU KNOW THERE IS A DIGITAL DIVIDE. YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS EVEN A CELL TELEPHONE DIVIDE. YOU KNOW THERE ARE KIDS GOING TO SCHOOL AND SMALL BUSINESSES STRUGGLING TO SUCCEED WHO DO NOT HAVE A FAST CONNECTION TO BROADBAND, AND THEY ARE BEING SHUT OUT OF THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE. LET'S SET A GOAL TO BUILD A CLEANER, MORE RESILIENT POWER GRID WITH ENOUGH RENEWABLE ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME IN AMERICA, AND I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THIS BECAUSE SOME COUNTRY WILL BE THE 21ST CENTURY CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER. WE INVENT MOST OF THE TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS, BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN AND SET THESE GOALS, IT IS MORE LIKELY TO BE CHINA OR GERMANY THAN US. THAT IS INTOLERABLE. IT NEEDS TO BE US. WE NEED TO HAVE A PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP TO SUCCEED. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO INVEST IN PUBLIC TRANSIT, FIX FAILING WATER SYSTEMS LIKE THE ONE THAT POISONED CHILDREN IN FLINT. RENOVATE OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS SO THAT EVERY CHILD IN EVERY COMMUNITY HAS ACCESS TO SAFE, HIGH-TECH CLASSROOMS, LABORATORIES, AND LIBRARIES. I USED TO HAVE THE CHELSEA TEST WHEN I WAS THE FIRST LADY OF ARKANSAS AND THEN WHEN I WAS FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES. I WOULD GO INTO HIS GOALS AROUND OUR COUNTRY AND THE FIRST THING I WOULD THINK IS THIS A SCHOOL BY LOOKING AT IT AND MEETING THE STAFF THAT I WOULD SEND CHELSEA TWO. O. I AM ASKING THE SAME QUESTIONS, IS THIS A SCHOOL THAT I WOULD SEND -- AND YOU KNOW THAT A LOT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS, THE ANSWER WAS A RESOUNDING YES, AND A LOT OF THEM NO. SCHOOLS LITERALLY FALLING DOWN, FILLED WITH MOLD, NO BOOKS IN THE LIBRARY, WHICH I ACTUALLY SAW MYSELF, SO WHEN WE WANT TO LIVE UP TO WHAT WE ALL SAY ABOUT OUR NEXT GENERATION, OUR CHILDREN ARE THE TREASURE OF OUR COUNTRY, WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHERE THEY SPEND MOST OF THEIR WAKING HOURS AND WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE THAT SENDS TO THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. INVESTMENTS LIKE THESE WILL HELP YOUR CITIES UNLOCK MORE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL AND COMPETE IN THE INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE, SO OUR GOAL SHOULD BE FULL EMPLOYMENT IN A FULL POTENTIAL ECONOMY, AND THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT GOOD, NEW JOBS OF THE FUTURE REACH THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT NEED THEM THE MOST, FROM URBAN CITIES TO RURAL AREAS. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TARGET BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES FIND A JOB, MAYBE A FIRST JOB, BECAUSE IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT FIRST JOB, GETTING THEM INTO THE WORKPLACE IS REALLY DIFFICULT. THEY NEED THE ATTITUDES OF WHAT GOES WITH A GOOD WORK ETHIC AS WELL AS THE SKILLS IN PREPARATION SO THAT THEY CAN START TO BUILD FINANCIAL STABILITY, GAIN THOSE SKILLS, THE CONFIDENCE AND EXPERIENCE, TO BUILD AND PURSUE THEIR OWN CAREER. WE NEED TO DIRECT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES IN HARD-HIT COMMUNITIES WHERE INVESTMENT IS SCARCE SO THAT ENTREPRENEURS HAVE A REAL CHANCE TO TURN THEIR IDEAS INTO GROWING ENTERPRISES THAT WILL PUT PEOPLE TO WORK. AFTER ALL, MOST OF THE NEW JOBS, TWO THIRDS OF THEM, WILL COME FROM SMALL BUSINESSES, AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE FALLING BACKWARD IN THE CREATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE CREDIT, THE ACCESS TO CREDIT, THAT WE USED TO. IT HAS NOT COME BACK AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION. AND WE NEED TO DO MORE TO HELP PEOPLE START THOSE BUSINESSES AND HIS EXCEED. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON SECOND CHANCE REENTRY PROGRAMS SO THAT PEOPLE RETURNING FROM PRISON HAVE A FAIR CHANCE TO REESTABLISH THEIR LIVES AND STRENGTHEN THEIR COMMUNITIES.   WE HAVE TO TAKE ON CITIZENS UNITED AND GET RID OF THE SECRET MONEY THAT IS RIGGING THE SYSTEM. NOW I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT MANY OF YOU IN CITY AND STATE ELECTIONS RUN UNDER TIGHTER REGULATIONS OR AT LEAST DISCLOSURES THAN WE NOW DO ON THE FEDERAL SIDE. I SAY THIS, NOT AS A DEMOCRAT, BUT AS AN AMERICAN. I THINK WE ARE SKATING ON THIN ICE. IT IS GETTING TO THE POINT THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE WE ARE COMING FROM. IT IS NOT BEING DISCLOSED. CRIMINAL CARTEL MONEY? YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY. WE WILL NEVER KNOW. THIS IS ABOUT HOW WE MAKE GOVERNMENT WORK AND RESTORE CONFIDENCE AND TRUST IN IT. THINK IT WILL CLEAR THE WAY TO GET SOMETHING DONE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PEOPLE HERE, BOTH SIDES OF THE POLITICAL DIVIDE CAME TOGETHER TO CREATE THE BIPARTISAN MAYOR COMPACT FOR A BETTER AMERICA PLAN. I CAN IMAGINE THAT SOME OF OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS HERE TODAY MAY HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER YOU CAN WORK WITH A DEMOCRAT, OR WORK WITH ME PERSONALLY. WE WILL DISAGREE. I DISAGREE WITH SOME OF MY DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS. I THINK THERE IS MUCH MORE THAT WE CAN AGREE ON. FOR ME, AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE, AS SENATOR, AS SECRETARY OF STATE, I KNOW WE CANNOT GET BIG THINGS DONE UNLESS WE WORK TOGETHER.  I INTEND TO PUSH FOR AN AGENDA THAT I THINK WOULD REALLY HELP THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY, OUR CITIES, AND CREATE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND BRING A SPEC TOGETHER. I WILL ALSO ALWAYS LISTEN. I THINK THAT IS AN LOST ART. I WANT TO GATHER PEOPLE TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE WILL SOLVE PROBLEMS. I HELPED CREATE THE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM WHEN I WAS FIRST LADY. WORKING WITH SENATORS AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FROM BOTH SIDES. WHEN I WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS, I KNEW AND SAID, NO POLITICAL PARTY HAS A MONOPOLY ON IDEAS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T EITHER. I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE TOOLS THAT YOU NEED TO GET THINGS DONE. AT LAST YEAR'S CONFERENCE I TALKED ABOUT AN APPROACH WE ARE CALLING FLEXIBLE FEDERALISM. RECOGNIZING THAT THE NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN EACH CITY DIFFER FROM OTHERS. THERE IS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION. WE NEED TO LISTEN AND RESPECT ONE ANOTHER. THAT IS WHY I WILL NEVER PLANNED FOR YOU. I HOPE THAT WE WILL PLAN WITH YOU TO RESPOND TO YOUR PRIORITIES TO GET MORE FUNDING WHETHER IT IS INFRASTRUCTURE OR HOUSING OR SECOND CHANCE PROGRAMS. SO WE CAN MAKE THE MOST USE, AS YOU SEE IT, OF THESE DOLLARS. I HAVE AN OLD-FASHIONED IDEA. WE WORK BETTER WHEN WE ARE LISTENING AND COOPERATING. WE WORK BETTER WHEN WE HAVE THE LOCAL LEVEL HELPING TO LEAD THE WAY. WHEN WE GET A PARTNERSHIP, NOT ONLY BETWEEN FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, BUT BETWEEN THE PRIVATE AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT SECTORS. THAT IS MY HOPE. THAT IS WHAT I AM IN TENT UPON DOING. BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT IT DURING THIS ELECTION. WE ARE MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN FEDERAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SEE EACH OTHER AS ALLIES AND NOT ADVERSARIES. THAT IS WHY I AM NOT JUST ASKING TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT I AM ASKING TO BE YOUR PARTNER. I'VE HEARD THERE IS A RUNNING JOKE IN THIS ORGANIZATION THAT MY HUSBAND TOOK OFFICE AS A PRESIDENT, BUT LEFT AS A MAYOR BECAUSE HE SPENT SO MUCH TIME WITH YOUR PREDECESSORS AND SOME OF YOU WERE THERE THEN. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THAT I WILL BUILD ON THAT. JUST LIKE YOU HAVE THE BACKS OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU SERVE, I WILL HAVE YOUR BACKS EVERYDAY. I INTEND TO BE CALLING YOU AND ASKING YOU FOR ADVICE, WORKING WITH YOU NONSTOP, VISITING TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE THAT WORKS THAT WE CAN BRING TO SCALE AND MAKE AVAILABLE FOR OTHERS AROUND THE COUNTRY. I WANT US ALWAYS TO HAVE AN OPEN LINE OF COMMUNICATION. I AM EXCITED BY WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. DESPITE THE CRACKING AND  -- THE GRIPING AND THE GRIDLOCK, I AM EXCITED. I THINK THE TIME IS RIGHT. PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF THIS PARTISANSHIP, THE EXTREME SCAPEGOATING AND FINGER-POINTING. I THINK WE ALL ENTERED PUBLIC SERVICE BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET THINGS DONE. THAT IS MY HOPE AND THAT IS MY PROMISE TO YOU. WHO SEES OUR CITY AS PROOF THAT AMERICA'S BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US. THERE IS THE CHALLENGE TOO-US TO OVERCOME TOGETHER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU ALL. WELL, THANK YOU.  IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE BACK HERE  IN COLUMBUS.  I WANT TO THANK WHITNEY FOR NOT JUST HER WONDERFUL INTRODUCTION,  BUT FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THAT  SHE HAS DONE TO BUILD HER CAREER AND THE VERY STRONG ENDORSEMENT THAT SHE HAS GIVEN TO FORT HAYS CAREER CENTER.  EVERYONE ASSOCIATED WITH FORD  HAYES, I WANT TO THANK YOU.  THIS IS EXACTLY HOW WE WILL CREATE MORE GOOD JOBS MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE PEOPLE AND IT IS EXCITING TO BE HERE IN  A PLACE THAT DOES JUST THAT.  I WANT TO THANK GOVERNOR TED STRICKLAND BY HOPE IS SOON TO BE  SENATOR TED STRICKLAND.   ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE WITH ME, I HAVE TO SAY I AM PRETTY THRILLED TO BE HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME SPEAKING TO ANY GROUP LIKE THIS AS A GRANDMOTHER OF TWO NOW.  IT WAS AN EXCITING WEEKEND. CHELSEA AND MARK HAD A LITTLE BOY AND WHERE JUST TRULY OVER THE MOON.  I HAVE TO CONFESS, I HAVE TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT BEING A GRANDMOTHER, NOW I AM SURE I'M  GOING TO BE TALKING DOUBLY ABOUT BEING A GRANDMOTHER. NEW STORIES TO TELL. IT IS ALWAYS GREAT WE BACK IN OHIO AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A CHALLENGE THAT OHIO FAMILIES  KNOW WELL. THROWING OUR ECONOMY AND MAKING IT WOULD FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST  THOSE AT THE TOP. FOR MORE THAN A YEAR NOW, I HAVE  BEEN LISTENING TO AMERICANS  ACROSS OUR COUNTRY.  YOU HAVE TOLD ME HOW THE RECESSION HIT YOUR COMMUNITIES.  HOW JOBS DRIED UP, HOME VALUES SANK. AND SAVINGS VANISHED. AND I HAVE SEEN HOW HARD YOU HAVE WORKED TO GET BACK ON YOUR  FEET. IF WE HAVE LEARNED ANYTHING ABOUT THE ECONOMY OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, IT IS THAT A PRESIDENT 'S ECONOMIC DECISIONS HAVE REAL  CONSEQUENCES FOR FAMILIES. PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS HANDED THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT OPPRESSION.  THINKS TO HIS LEADERSHIP AND  HARD WORK AND THE RESILIENCE OF  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WE HAVE SEEN  MORE THAN 14 MILLION PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS CREATED OVER THE LAST SIX AND A HALF YEARS.  HERE IN OHIO, THE AUTO INDUSTRY HAS MADE A STRONG COMEBACK.   AND HOW APPROPRIATE AS WE ARE HERE IN THE AREA WHERE  STUDENTS LEARN ABOUT AUTOS. LEARN ABOUT HOW THEY ARE MADE  AND HOW THEY WORK SO, WE KNOW  PEOPLE ARE WORKING HARDER AND  LONGER. JUST TO KEEP THEIR HEADS ABOVE WATER. AND TO DEAL WITH THE COST, THE  EVERYDAY COSTS, THE COST OF  BASICS LIKE CHILDCARE AND  DESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT ARE TOO HIGH.  COLLEGE IS GETTING MORE  EXPENSIVE EVERY DAY. AND WAGES ARE STILL TOO LOW. AND INEQUALITY IS TOO GREAT. GOOD JOBS IN MANY PARTS OF OUR  COUNTRY ARE STILL TOO HARD TO  COME BY. THESE PROBLEMS ARE SERIOUS BUT I KNOW WE CAN OVERCOME THEM  TOGETHER. I REALLY BELIEVE IN THIS COUNTRY  BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AMERICA'S ECONOMY IS NOT YET WHERE WE WANT IT TO BE BUT WE  ARE STRONGER AND BETTER POSITIONED THAN ANYONE IN THE WORLD TO BUILD THE FUTURE THAT YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN DESERVE. AND I HAVE SPENT MY ADULT LIFE WORKING TO EVEN THE ODDS FOR  PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THE ODDS STACKED AGAINST THEM. I HELPED BREAK DOWN BARRIERS TO EDUCATION FOR POOR AND DISABLED CHILDREN AS A YOUNG LAWYER. HOT FOR HEALTH INSURANCE FOR ALL  AND HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO THAT SINCE MY DAYS AS FIRST LADY. I WORKED TO BRING OPPORTUNITY BACK TO UPSTATE NEW YORK IN A  LOT OF DEPRESSED COMMUNITIES THERE AS SENATOR AND WENT TO BAT  FOR AMERICAN WORKERS AND BUSINESSES AS YOUR SECRETARY OF  STATE. AND EVERYTHING I HAVE LEARNED  AND EVERYTHING I HAVE DONE HAS  CONVINCED ME WE ARE STRONGER  WHEN WE GROW TOGETHER.   AND I HAVE SAID THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN THAT MY MISSION AS PRESIDENT WILL BE TO HELP CREATE MORE GOOD PAYING JOBS SO WE CAN GET INCOMES RISING FOR HARD-WORKING FAMILIES  ACROSS AMERICA. IT IS A PRETTY SIMPLE FORMULA. HIGHER WAGES LEAD TO MORE DEMAND  WHICH LEADS TO MORE JOBS WITH  HIGHER WAGES. AND I HAVE LAID OUT A DETAILED AGENDA TO JUMPSTART THIS VIRTUAL CYCLE.  YOU CAN GO TO MY WEBSITE, HILLARYCLINTON.COM AND READ ALL  ABOUT IT.  I ADMIT IT IS A LITTLE WONKY.   I HAVE THIS OLD-FASHIONED IDEA THAT IF  YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, YOU SHOULD SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. HOW YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT, AND HOW YOU WILL GET IT DONE.  I ACTUALLY SWEAT THE SPECIFICS  BECAUSE THEY MATTER.  WHETHER ONE MORE KID GETS HEALTH CARE MAY JUST BE A DETAIL IN WASHINGTON, BUT IT IS ALL THAT MATTERS TO THAT FAMILY WORRYING  ABOUT THEIR CHILD. TOMORROW IN NORTH CAROLINA I  WILL SET OUT AMBITIOUS NEW GOALS THAT WILL HELP US BUILD A STRONGER, FAIRER ECONOMY. WE WILL WORK WITH THOSE PARTIES TO MAKE TRANSFORMATIONAL INVESTMENTS IN GOOD PAYING JOBS IN INFRASTRUCTURE, ADVANCED  MANUFACTURING, CLEAN ENERGY, AND  SMALL BUSINESS AND WE WILL TRACK -- TACKLED THE TWIN PROBLEM OF COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND STUDENT DEBT.  WE WILL PURSUE INNOVATIVE IDEAS LIKE CORPORATE PROFITEERING BECAUSE EVERYONE WHO WORKS HARD SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE IN THE  REWARDS OF THEIR HARD WORK. AND TO PAY FOR THESE INVESTMENTS , WE WILL MAKE SURE IT WALL  STREET CORPORATIONS AND THE SUPERRICH CONTRIBUTE THEIR FAIR  SHARE. WE WILL -- THAT IS WHAT I WILL  BE TALKING ABOUT TOMORROW IN NORTH CAROLINA AND THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN BUT TODAY, I WANT  TO TALK ABOUT WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS PROMISING TO DO TO THE ECONOMY. AFTER MORE THAN A YEAR, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT HE BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT HE SAYS HE WILL DO AS PRESIDENT. AND -- WE NEED TO CLEAR THE WAY  FOR A REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF  WORKING PEOPLE. A FEW WEEKS AGO, I SAID HIS  FOREIGN-POLICY PROPOSALS AND RECKLESS STATEMENTS REPRESENT A  DANGER TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. BUT YOU MIGHT THINK THAT BECAUSE HE HAS SPENT HIS LIFE AS A BUSINESSMAN SHOULD IT WOULD BE  BETTER PREPARED TO HANDLE THE  ECONOMY. IT TURNS OUT HE IS DANGEROUS THERE, TOO. JUST LIKE HE SHOULD NOT HAVE HIS  FINGER ON THE BUTTON, HE SHOULD  NOT HAVE HIS HAND ON OUR  ECONOMY.   NOW, I DO NOT SAY THAT BECAUSE OF TO GO POLITICAL DISCRIMINANT. LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES SAY  TRUMP'S IDEAS WOULD BE DISASTROUS.  THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND  LABOR UNIONS, MITT ROMNEY AND ELIZABETH WARREN, ECONOMISTS ON  THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT AND THE CENTER ALL AGREE, TRUMP WOULD  THROW US BACK INTO RECESSION. ONE OF JOHN MCCAIN'S FORMER  ECONOMIC ADVISERS ACTUALLY CALCULATED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO OUR COUNTRY IF TRUMP GETS HIS  WAY. HE DESCRIBED THE RESULTS OF A TRUMP RECESSION.  WE WOULD LOSE 3.5 MILLION JOBS. INCOMES WOULD STAGNATE. DEADWOOD EXPLODE -- DEBT WOULD EXPLODE AND START PRICES WOULD  PLUMMET. AND TO YOU KNOW WHO WOULD BE HIT  THE HARDEST? THE PEOPLE WHO HAD THE HARDEST TIME DOING BACK ON THEIR FEET AFTER THE 2008 CRISIS. ONE OF THE LEADING FIRMS THAT ANALYZES THE TOP THREAT TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY CALLED THE  ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT  COMES OUT WITH A NEW LIST OF  THREATS EVERY MONTH.  IT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE TERRORISM, AND THE  DISINTEGRATION OF EUROPE. AND THIS MONTH, NUMBER THREE ON  THE LIST IS DONALD TRUMP BECOMING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES. JUST THINK ABOUT THAT.  EVERY DAY, WE SEE HOW RECKLESS AND CARELESS TRUMP IS. HE IS PROUD OF IT. WELL, THAT IS HIS CHOICE. EXCEPT WHEN HE IS ASKING TO BE OUR PRESIDENT.  THEN IT IS OUR CHOICE.  DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY STOOD ON  THE DEBATE STAGE IN NOVEMBER  AND SAID THAT WAGES ARE TOO HIGH  IN THIS COUNTRY. HE SHOULD TELL THAT TO THE  MOTHERS AND FATHERS WORKING TWO  JOBS TO RAISE THEIR KIDS.  HE SAID AND I QUOTE, ""HAVING A  LOW MINIMUM WAGE IS NOT A BAD  THING FOR THIS COUNTRY AT A TIME WHEN MILLIONS WORKING FULL-TIME ARE STILL LIVING IN POVERTY."" BACK IN 2006 BEFORE THE FINANCIAL CRASH, FROM SAID AND  AGAIN I QUOTE, ""I SORT OF THAT  THE HOUSING MARKET CRASHES BECAUSE"" HE WOULD MAKE MONEY ON  THE FORECLOSURES. HE HAS SAID ALL KINDS OF THINGS ABOUT WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE.  HE ONCE CALLED PREGNANT EMPLOYEES OF QUOTE EMPLOYEES ""AN INCONVENIENCE."" THESE ARE THE WORDS OF -- NOT OF SOMEONE WHO THINKS HIGHLY OF  WOMEN WHO WORK OR CARES ABOUT HELPING PARENTS BALANCE WORK AND  FAMILY BUT INSTEAD, HE CLEARLY  DOES NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT HOW WE  HAVE GROWN THE ECONOMY OVER THE  LAST 40 YEARS WAGES LARGELY THANKS TO WOMEN GETTING INTO THE  WORKFORCE AND ADDING TO FAMILY INCOME. AND HE WANTS TO END OBAMACARE BUT HAS NO CREDIBLE PLAN TO  REPLACE IT OR TO HELP KEEP COSTS DOWN. IT REALLY WOULDN'T BE GOOD FOR  OUR ECONOMY, WOULD IT, IF 20 MILLION PEOPLE LOST THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE. AND WE WERE BACK TO ABSOLUTELY SKYROCKETING COSTS FOR EVERYTHING. IT WOULD BE DEVASTATING TO  FAMILIES AND ALSO THE ECONOMY. FIRST, THERE'S HIS PLAN FOR WALL STREET. AFTER THE 2008 CRISIS, PRESIDENT  OBAMA FOUGHT TO ENACT THE  TOUGHEST MOST COMPREHENSIVE SET  OF WALL STREET REFORMS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION.  THEY ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT  CONSUMERS AND ENSURE THAT WALL  STREET CAN NEVER AGAIN TAKE THE  KINDS OF RISKS THAT CRASHED OUR  ECONOMY THE LAST TIME.  SO WHAT WOULD TRUMP DO?  HE SAID HE WANTS TO WIPE OUT THE  TOUGH RULES WE PUT ON BIG BANKS.  HE SAYS THEY CREATED, QUOTE, A  VERY BAD SITUATION. WELL, HE'S GOT IT BACKWARDS. THE VERY BAD SITUATION WAS  MILLIONS OF FAMILIES SEEING  THEIR HOMES AND SAVINGS  DISAPPEAR.  HE ALSO WANTS TO REPEAL THE  CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECT  BUREAU, THE NEW CONSUMER WATCHDOG THAT SENATOR WARREN  HELPED CREATE TO PROTECT  FAMILIES FROM UNFAIR AND  DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES.  THAT NEW AGENCY HAS ALREADY  SECURED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN  RETURNS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN  RIPPED OFF.  DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO GET RID OF  IT. TRUMP WOULD TAKE US BACK TO  WHERE WE WERE BEFORE THE CRISIS.  HEED RIG THE ECONOMY FOR WALL -- HE WOULD RIG THE ECONOMY FOR  WALL STREET AGAIN.  WELL, THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN ON MY  WATCH, I CAN GUARANTEE YOU.  MS. CLINTON I WOULD VETO ANY : EFFORT TO WEAKEN THOSE REFORMS. I WILL DEFEND AND STRENGTHEN  THEM BOTH FOR THE BIG BANKS AND  THE SHADOW BANKING SYSTEM. AND I WILL VIGOROUSLY ENFORCE THE LAW BECAUSE WE CAN'T EVER LET WALL STREET WRECK MAIN STREET AGAIN. NOW, SECOND THERE'S DONALD TRUMP'S APPROACH TO OUR NATIONAL DEBT. NOW, I HAVE A PLAN TO PAY FOR ALL MY PROPOSALS BECAUSE I TAKE AMERICA'S LONG-TERM FINANCIAL HEALTH SERIOUSLY. DONALD TRUMP HAS A DIFFERENT APPROACH.  HE CALLS HIMSELF THE KING OF  DEBT.  HIS TAX PLAN SURE LIVES UP TO  THAT NAME.  ACCORDING TO THE INDEPENDENT TAX  POLICY CENTER, IT WOULD INCREASE  THE NATIONAL DEBT BY MORE THAN $30 TRILLION OVER 20 YEARS.  THAT'S TRILLION WITH A T.  THAT'S MUCH MORE MONEY THAN ANY  NOMINEE OF EITHER PARTY HAS EVER PROPOSED.  AN ECONOMIST DESCRIBED IT WITH  WORDS LIKE NOT EVEN IN THE  UNIVERSE OF THE REALISTIC.  HOW WOULD HE PAY FOR ALL THIS DEBT?  WELL, HE SAID, AND I QUOTE, I  WOULD BORROW KNOWING IF THE  ECONOMY CRASHED YOU COULD MAKE A DEAL.  IT'S LIKE, HE SAID, YOU KNOW,  YOU MAKE A DEAL BEFORE YOU GO  INTO A POKER GAME.  IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL.  THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE  UNITED STATES IS NOT SOMETHING  WE JUST GAMBLE AWAY.  THAT COULD CAUSE AN ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE. / AND IT WOULD BREAK 225 YEARS OF  IRONCLAD TRUST THAT THE AMERICAN  ECONOMY HAS WITH AMERICANS AND  WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD.  ALEXANDER HAMILTON WOULD BE  ROLLING IN HIS GRAVE.  WE PAY OUR DEBTS.  THAT'S WHY INVESTORS COME HERE  EVEN WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE  WORLD GOES WRONG.  YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT FROM ME.  RONALD REAGAN SAID IT.  HE SAID, WE HAVE A WELL EARNED  REPUTATION FOR RELIABILITY AND CREDIBILITY. TWO THINGS THAT SET US APART  FROM MUCH OF THE WORLD.  MAYBE DONALD FEELS DIFFERENTLY  BECAUSE HE MADE A FORTUNE FILING BANKRUPTCIES AND SKIPPING HIS CREDITORS. I'LL GET TO HIS BUSINESS PRACTICES IN A MINUTE. BUT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA DOESN'T DO BUSINESS TRUMP'S WAY. AND IT MATTERS --   IT MATTERS WHEN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TALKS LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE WORLD HANGS ON EVERY WORD OUR PRESIDENT SAYS. THE MARKETS RISE AND FALL ON THOSE STATEMENTS. EVEN SUGGESTING THAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD DEFAULT WOULD CAUSE  A GLOBAL PANIC.  TRUMP ALSO SAID WE CAN JUST PRINT MORE MONEY TO PAY OUR DEBT DOWN.  WELL, WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO  COUNTRIES THAT TRIED THAT IN THE  PAST LIKE GERMANY IN THE 20'S OR  ZIMBABWE IN THE 1990'S.  IT DROVE INFLATION THROUGH THE  ROOF AND CRIPPLED THEIR ECONOMIES.  THE AMERICAN DOLLAR IS THE  SAFEST CURRENCY ON THE PLANET.  WHY WOULD HE WANT TO MESS WITH THAT?  WE HAVE TO STAND UP FOR OUR HISTORY.  DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HAVE  ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THIS.  WE CAN'T LET THESE LOOSE, CARELESS REMARKS GET ANY  CREDENCE IN OUR ELECTORATE OR  AROUND THE WORLD.  FINALLY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAID  IF WORSE CAME TO WORSE WE COULD  SELL OFF AMERICA'S ASSETS. REALLY?  EVEN IF WE SOLD ALL OF OUR  AIRCRAFT CARRIERS AND THE STATUE  OF LIBERTY, EVEN IF WE LET SOME  BILLIONAIRE TURN YOSEMITE INTO A  PRIVATE COUNTRY CLUB, WE'D STILL WOULDN'T EVEN GET CLOSE. THAT'S HOW MUCH DEBT HE WOULD RUN UP. MAYBE THIS IS WHAT HE MEANS WHEN HE SAYS I LOVE PLAYING WITH DEBT. SOMEONE SHOULD TELL HIM OUR NATION'S ECONOMY ISN'T A GAME. THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE UNITED STATES IS SACRED. WE KNOW WHAT SOUND FISCAL POLICY LOOKS LIKE AND IT SURE ISN'T RUNNING UP MASSIVE DEBTS TO PAY FOR GIVEAWAYS TO THE RICH AND IT'S NOT PAINFUL AUSTERITY THAT  HURTS WORKING FAMILIES AND  UNDERCUTS OUR LONG-TERM  PROGRESS.  IT'S BEING STRONG, STABLE AND  MAKING SMART INVESTMENTS IN OUR FUTURE.  SO LET'S SET THE RIGHT PRIORITIES AND PAY FOR THEM SO WE CAN HAND OUR CHILDREN A  HEALTHIER ECONOMY AND A BETTER FUTURE.  THIRD, THERE IS DONALD TRUMP'S  TAX PLAN.  WHEN I WAS WORKING ON THIS  SPEECH, I HAD THE SAME  EXPERIENCE I HAD WHEN I WAS  WORKING ON THE SPEECH I GAVE  ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY AND  NATIONAL SECURITY.  I'D HAVE MY RESEARCHERS AND MY  SPEECH WRITERS SEND ME  INFORMATION AND THEN I'D SAY REALLY?  HE REALLY SAID THAT?  AND THEY'D SEND ME ALL THE  BACKGROUND OR THE VIDEO CLIP.  SO, HERE GOES.  HE WOULD GIVE MILLIONAIRES A $3 TRILLION TAX CUT. CORPORATIONS WOULD GET $2 TRILLION MORE DOLLARS.  THAT MEANS HE'S GIVING MORE AWAY  TO THE 120,000 RICHEST AMERICAN  FAMILIES THAN HE WOULD TO HELP  120 MILLION HARDWORKING AMERICANS. EVEN IN THIS ERA OF RISING  INEQUALITY, THIS IS LIKE NOTHING  WE HAVE EVER SEEN.  NOW, YOU AND I KNOW THAT THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS AND THE  BIGGEST CORPORATIONS DON'T NEED  TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX CUTS.  THEY NEED TO BE PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. NOW BEFORE RELEASING HIS PLAN, TRUMP SAID, HEDGE FUND GUYS ARE GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER. AND HE ADDED, THEY'LL PAY MORE. THEN HIS PLAN CAME OUT. IT ACTUALLY MAKES THE CURRENT LOOPHOLE EVEN WORSE. IT GIVES HEDGE FUND MANAGERS A SPECIAL TAX RATE THAT'S LOWER THAN WHAT MANY MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES PAY. AND I DID HAVE TO LOOK TWICE BECAUSE I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT. UNDER DONALD TRUMP'S PLAN, THESE WALL STREET MILLIONAIRES WILL  PAY A LOWER TAX RATE THAN MANY  WORKING PEOPLE.  AND OF COURSE, DONALD HIMSELF  WOULD GET A HUGE TAX CUT FROM  HIS OWN PLAN.  SO WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW  MUCH BECAUSE HE WON'T RELEASE  HIS TAX RETURNS.  EVERY MAJOR PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE IN THE LAST FOUR  DECADES HAS SHOWN THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE THEIR TAXES.  IN FACT, DONALD ACTUALLY TOLD  MITT ROMNEY TO DO IT.  AND HE SAID THAT IF HE EVER RAN  FOR PRESIDENT HE WOULD RELEASE  HIS RETURNS.  MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE RELEASED  OURS GOING BACK NEARLY 40 YEARS.  AND NOW DONALD'S REFUSING TO DO SO.  YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF, WHAT'S  HE AFRAID OF?  MAYBE THAT WE'LL LEARN HE HASN'T  PAID TAXES ON HIS HUGE INCOME?  WE KNOW THAT HAPPENED FOR AT  LEAST A FEW YEARS.  HE PAID NOTHING OR CLOSE TO IT.  OR MAYBE HE ISN'T AS RICH AS HE CLAIMS.  OR THAT HE HASN'T GIVEN AWAY AS  MUCH TO CHARITY AS HE BRAGS ABOUT.  WHATEVER THE REASON AMERICANS  DESERVE TO KNOW BEFORE YOU CAST  YOUR VOTES THIS NOVEMBER.  AND WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER PEOPLE'S TAXES, DONALD TRUMP'S  GOT IT ALL WRONG.  WE NEED TO DO BETTER BY THE MIDDLE CLASS NOT BY THE RICH,  AND THAT'S WHY MY PLAN WILL HELP  WORKING FAMILIES WITH THE COST  OF COLLEGE, HEALTH CARE, AND CHILDCARE, THE THINGS THAT REALLY STRETCH A FAMILY'S BUDGET. THAT'S WHERE OUR FOCUS SHOULD BE. NOW, FOURTH, DONALD TRUMP'S IDEAS ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND THE  WORLD WILL CAUSE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO LOSE THEIR JOBS. THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY FEATURED THE TRUMP IMMIGRATION PLAN.  ROUND UP AND DEPORT MORE THAN 11 MILLION PEOPLE, ALMOST ALL OF WHOM ARE EMPLOYED OR ARE CHILDREN GOING TO SCHOOL, THEN BUILD A WALL ACROSS OUR BORDER, AND FORCE MEXICO TO PAY FOR IT.  NOW, THIS POLICY IS NOT ONLY  WRONG-HEADED AND UNACHIEVABLE,  IT IS REALLY BAD ECONOMICS.  KICKING OUT 11 MILLION  IMMIGRANTS WOULD COST HUNDREDS  OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  AND IT WOULD SHRINK OUR ECONOMY SIGNIFICANTLY.  SOME ECONOMISTS ACTUALLY ARGUE  THAT JUST THIS POLICY ALONE  WOULD SEND US INTO A TRUMP RECESSION.  SO INSTEAD OF CAUSING  LARGE-SCALE MISERY AND SHRINKING  OUR ECONOMY, WE SHOULD PASS  SENSIBLE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH  A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP BECAUSE  THE YOUTH --   THE YOUTH AND  DIAPERS CITY OF OUR WORKFORCE IS  ONE OF OUR GREATEST -- GREATEST  ASSETS.  MOST OF THE REST OF THE WORLD WE  COMPETE WITH IS AGING. BY STAYING YOUNGER AND FRESHER,  WITH TALENTS THAT CAN BE PUT TO  WORK, WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO  BE IN A STRONGER ECONOMIC  POSITION. WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE BORN ELSEWHERE  COULD WORK HARD, START BUSINESSES, AND CONTRIBUTE TO  OUR GROWTH. THAT MAKES US STRONGER. AND MORE PROSPEROUS. AND THEN, THERE'S TRADE. I BELIEVE WE CAN COMPETE AND WIN  IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. TO DO THAT, WE SHOULD RENEGOTIATE TRADE DEALS THAT ARE NOT WORKING FOR AMERICANS, AND  REJECT ANY AGREEMENTS, LIKE THE  TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP, THAT  DON'T MEET MY HIGH BAR FOR RAISING WAGES OR CREATING GOOD-PAYING JOBS.  AND I WILL BE TOUGH ON TRADE  ENFORCEMENT, AS WELL. BECAUSE WHEN CHINA DUMPS CHEAP  STEEL IN OUR MARKETS, OR  UNFAIRLY MANIPULATES CURRENCY,  WE NEED TO RESPOND FORCEFULLY. AT THE SAME TIME, WE NEED TO  INVEST MORE HERE AT HOME.  I HAVE A ""MAKE IT IN AMERICA""  PLAN TO INCREASE 21ST CENTURY  ANY FACTORING AND ENERGY JOBS IN  AMERICA, AND WE WILL BUILD ON  THE GREAT IDEAS OF SENATOR SHARON BROWN AND INVEST $10 BILLION IN MANUFACTURING  COMMUNITIES.   I AGREE WITH SHARON THAT, WITH THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS AND A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD,  AMERICAN WORKERS WILL OUT-HUSTLE  AND OUT-INNOVATE ANYONE IN THE WORLD. DONALD TRUMP MAKES BIG THREATS,  BUT HE HAS NO SERIOUS PLAN TO ENCOURAGE MANUFACTURING, INNOVATION, OR JOB CREATION IN  OUR COUNTRY. AND THERE IS A DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN GETTING TOUGH ON TRADE, AND RECKLESSLY STARTING TRADE WARS.  THE LAST TIME WE OPTED FOR TRUMP -STYLE ISOLATIONISM, IT MADE THE  GREAT DEPRESSION LONGER AND MORE PAINFUL. INTERESTINGLY, TRUMP'S OWN  PRODUCTS ARE MADE IN A LOT OF COUNTRIES THAT AREN'T NAMED AMERICA. TRUMP TIES ARE MADE IN CHINA. TRUMP SUITS, IN MEXICO.  TRUMP FURNITURE, IN TURKEY. TRUMP PICTURE FRAMES, IN INDIA. TRUMP BARWARE, IN SLOVENIA.  I COULD GO ON, BUT YOU GET THE  IDEA. I WOULD LOVE FOR HIM TO EXPLAIN HOW ALL THAT FITS WITH HIS TALK ABOUT ""AMERICA FIRST."" I  HONESTLY BELIEVE --    THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US IS NOT JUST ABOUT  POLICY. WE HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT VIEWS.  OF WHETHER AMERICA IS STRONG OR WEAK. YOU SEE, I BELIEVE IN THE  INGENUITY AND PRODUCTIVITY OF  AMERICAN WORKERS.  I KNOW WE CAN SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO THE 95% OF GLOBAL CONSUMERS WHO LIVE OUTSIDE OF OUR COUNTRY. ON THE OTHER HAND, DONALD TRUMP  NEVER MISSES A CHANCE TO SAY THAT AMERICANS, HE IS TALKING ABOUT US, TO SAY THAT AMERICANS ARE LOSERS, AND THE REST OF THE  WORLD IS LAUGHING AT US. JUST THE OTHER DAY, HE TOLD A  CROWD THAT AMERICA IS ""NOT GOING  TO SURVIVE."" I DO NOT KNOW WHAT  HE IS TALKING ABOUT. I WENT TO 112 COUNTRIES AS YOUR  SECRETARY OF STATE, AND WHAT I  SAW IS NV, NV -- ENVY FOR OUR  STRENGTH, VALUES, DIVERSITY, THE  FUTURE WE ARE MAKING TOGETHER.  I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW SOMEONE  RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES COULD EVER THINK  THAT THAT IS TRUE. I DO UNDERSTAND HOW FRUSTRATING,  FEARFUL, AND EVEN ANGRY MANY PEOPLE ARE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE UNDER-EMPLOYED OR MAKING A LOT LESS THAN YOU USED TO, OR WORRYING THAT YOUR KIDS OR GRANDKIDS WON'T HAVE THE KIND OF  GOOD, SOLID MIDDLE-CLASS LIKE YOU DID. AND WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH TO INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITIES, AND  IN OUR PEOPLE, TO MAKE SURE  THERE ARE ENOUGH GOOD JOBS WITH  RISING INCOMES TO CREATE THAT  GOOD FUTURE FOR ALL OF US. THE ANSWER IS TO DO THAT. TO BRING PEOPLE ALONG ON A  AMERICA'S RIDE TO PROSPERITY  THAT WE ALL CAN SHARE. NOT TRY TO TURN THE CLOCK BACK, PRETEND WE CAN'T COMPETE AND DECREASE THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE.  BUT THOSE ARE HIS PLANS FOR THE  ECONOMY. NOW, YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THERE  IS A LOT MISSING. THE KING OF DEBT HAS NO REAL PLANS FOR MAKING COLLEGE DEBT PAYABLE BACK, OR MAKING COLLEGE DEBT-FREE.  THIS IS A CRISIS THAT AFFECTS SO  MANY OF OUR PEOPLE.  HE HAS NO CREDIBLE PLAN FOR  REBUILDING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, APART FROM THE WALL HE WANTS TO BUILD. PERSONALLY, I WOULD RATHER SPEND  OUR MONEY ON REBUILDING OUR SCHOOLS, OR MODERNIZING OUR  ENERGY GRID.   HE HAS NO IDEAS OF  HOW TO STRENGTHEN MEDICARE OR  EXPAND SOCIAL SECURITY. IN FACT, HIS TAX PLAN WOULD ENDANGER BOTH.  HE HAS NO REAL STRATEGY FOR CREATING JOBS. IT IS A STRING OF EMPTY  PROMISES. BUT THEN, MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T EXPECT BETTER FROM SOMEONE WHOSE MOST FAMOUS WORDS ARE ""YOU'RE FIRED."" HE HAS NO CLEAN ENERGY  PLAN, EVEN THOUGH THAT IS WHERE  MANY OF THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE  WILL COME FROM.  IT IS THE KEY TO A SAFER,  HEALTHIER PLANET. HE SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE IS A  HOAX, INVENTED BY THE CHINESE. I WILL GIVE HIM THIS, IT IS A  LOT EASIER TO SAY A PROBLEM  DOESN'T EXIST, THEN IT IS TO  ACTUALLY TRY TO SOLVE IT.   AND OF COURSE, HE  HAS NO PLAN FOR HELPING URBAN  AND RURAL COMMUNITIES FACING  ENTRENCHED POVERTY AND NEGLECT. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE ISSUES MATTER.  THEY AFFECT WHETHER YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GO TO COLLEGE, WHETHER  SINGLE MOMS CAN SUPPORT THEIR KIDS, WHETHER GRANDPARENTS CAN  HAVE A DIGNIFIED RETIREMENT.  WHAT COULD BE MORE IMPORTANT? IN THE HEAT OF A CAMPAIGN, IN A  CULTURE THAT REWARDS BREVITY AND  CLEVER PHRASES ON SOCIAL MEDIA,  IT IS TEMPTING TO GIVE SIMPLE ANSWERS TO COMPLEX PROBLEMS. BELIEVE ME, I HAVE BEEN TEMPTED. BUT I AM NOT GOING TO DO THAT,  BECAUSE IT REALLY MATTERS THAT  YOU KNOW WHAT I BELIEVE WE CAN  AND SHOULD DO, SO YOU CAN HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE IN THE ELECTION,  AND THEN, IN THE WHITE HOUSE.   BECAUSE WHETHER WE  INCREASE EMPLOYMENT AND DISTRESS , RURAL COMMUNITIES, OR GET  HEALTH CARE TO PEOPLE WHO STILL  DON'T HAVE IT, THAT MATTERS.  AND TO ME, THAT IS THE PURPOSE  OF POLITICS, TO EMPOWER PEOPLE  IN A DEMOCRACY TO HAVE BETTER  LIVES. TO MAKE BETTER CHOICES. TO SEIZE OPPORTUNITIES TO GIVE  THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES THAT PATHWAY TO THE FUTURE.  AND ONE MORE THING, I THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID HE IS  QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS RECORD. A FEW DAYS AGO, HE SAID, AND I QUOTE, ""I AM GOING TO DO FOR THE  COUNTRY WHAT I DID FOR MY BUSINESS."" LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT  WHAT HE DID. FOR HIS BUSINESS.  HE HAS WRITTEN A LOT OF BOOKS  ABOUT THIS THIS -- ABOUT BUSINESS.  THEY ALL SEEM TO END AT CHAPTER  11.   GO FIGURE. AND OVER THE YEARS, THE -- HE  INTENTIONALLY RAN UP HUGE  AMOUNTS OF DEBT ON HIS  COMPANIES, THEN HE DEFAULTED. HE BANKRUPTED HIS COMPANIES, NOT  ONCE, NOT TWICE, BUT FOUR TIMES. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS.  SHAREHOLDERS WERE WIPED OUT. CONTRACTORS, MANY OF THEM SMALL BUSINESSES, TOOK HEAVY LOSSES. MANY WENT BUST.  BUT DONALD TRUMP, HE CAME OUT FINE. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT ONE OF  THOSE BANKRUPTCIES. ""I FIGURED IT WAS THE BANKS PROBLEM, NOT MINE. WHAT THE HELL DID I CARE? "" HE ALSO SAYS, ""I PLAY WITH BANKRUPTCY."" EVERYTHING SEEMS TO  BE A GAME WITH HIM.  WELL, IT IS IN FOR A LOT OF US,  IS IT? LOOK AT WHAT HE DID IN ATLANTIC CITY.  HE PUT HIS NAME ON BUILDINGS, HIS FAVORITE THING TO DO.  HE CONVINCED OTHER PEOPLE THAT  HIS PROPERTIES WERE A GREAT INVESTMENT, SO THEY WOULD GO IN WITH HIM.  BUT HE ARRANGED IT SO HE GOT PAID NO MATTER HOW HIS COMPANIES  PERFORMED. SO WHEN HIS CASINO AND HOTEL  WENT BANKRUPT BECAUSE OF HOW BADLY HE MISMANAGED THEM, HE  STILL WALKED AWAY WITH MILLIONS, WHILE EVERYBODY ELSE PAY THE PRICE -- PAID THE PRICE. TODAY, HIS PROPERTIES ARE SOLD, SHUTTERED, OR FALLING APART.  AND SO ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE'S  LIVES. HERE'S WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT THAT. ""ATLANTIC CITY WAS A VERY GOOD  CASH COW FOR ME FOR A LONG TIME ."" REMEMBER THAT THE NEXT TIME  YOU SEE HIM TALKING ON TV.  ABOUT HOW WE WILL ALL WIN BIG IF  ONLY WE ELECT HIM PRESIDENT. HE IS TRYING TO SAY HE HAS CHANGED. SOMEBODY TOLD HIM HE NEEDS TO  SAY THAT.  THAT HE IS NOT IN IT FOR HIMSELF ANYMORE, HE IS IN IT FOR AMERICA.  BUT HE IS DOING THE SAME THING  HE HAS BEEN DOING FOR YEARS.  THIS IS HIS ONE MOVE. HE MAKES OVER THE TOP PROMISES, THAT OF PEOPLE STICK WITH HIM,  TRUST HIM, LISTEN TO HIM, PUT THEIR FAITH IN HIM, HE WILL  DELIVER FOR THEM.  HE WILL MAKE THEM WILDLY SUCCESSFUL.  THEN EVERYTHING FALLS APART, AND  PEOPLE GET HURT. THOSE PROMISES YOU ARE HEARING  FROM HIM AT HIS CAMPAIGN  RALLIES, THEY ARE THE SAME  PROMISES HE MADE TO HIS CUSTOMERS AT TRUMP UNIVERSITY. AND NOW, NOW, THEY ARE SUING HIM  FOR FRAUD.  THE SAME PEOPLE HE IS TRYING TO GET TO VOTE FOR HIM ARE PEOPLE  HE HAS BEEN EXPLOITING FOR  YEARS. BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST OTHER INVESTORS, OTHER RICH PEOPLE THAT HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF. IT WAS WORKING PEOPLE.  HE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN MORE THAN 3500 LAWSUITS IN THE LAST 30 YEARS. AND A LARGE NUMBER WERE FILED BY ORDINARY AMERICANS AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT DID WORK FOR TRUMP, AND NEVER GOT PAID. WAITERS, PLUMBERS, PEOPLE WHO  NEEDED THE MONEY AND DIDN'T GET  IT. NOT BECAUSE HE COULDN'T PAY  THEM, THAT BECAUSE HE COULD -- BUT BECAUSE HE COULD STIFF THEM.  SOMETIMES, HE OFFERED THEM $.30  ON THE DOLLAR FOR PROJECT THAT -- PROJECTS THEY HAD ALREADY  COMPLETED. HUNDREDS OF LIENS HAVE BEEN  FILED AGAINST HIM BY CONTRACTORS GOING BACK DECADES, AND THEY ALL  TELL A SIMILAR STORY.  I WORKED FOR HIM, I DID MY JOB,  HE WOULDN'T PAY ME WHAT HE OWED ME. MY LATE FATHER WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN. IF HIS CUSTOMERS HAD DONE WHAT TRUMP DID, MY DAD WOULD NEVER HAVE MADE IT. SO I TAKE THIS PERSONALLY. HE SAYS HE IS A BUSINESSMAN, AND  THIS IS WHAT BUSINESSMEN DO.  WELL, CNN POINTED OUT THAT NO MAJOR COMPANY HAS FILED CHAPTER 11 MORE OFTEN IN THE LAST 30 YEARS THEN TRUMP'S CASINOS. THIS IS NOT NORMAL BEHAVIOR. THERE ARE GREAT BUSINESS PEOPLE  HERE IN OHIO, IN AMERICA, BRILLIANT HARD-WORKING MEN AND  WOMEN WHO CARE ABOUT THEIR WORKERS AND THE PEOPLE THEY DO BUSINESS WITH. AND THEY WANT TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT LAST. THEY ARE DECENT, HONEST, PATRIOTS.  SOME MAY EVEN MAKE FINE PRESIDENTS.  THEY WOULD NEVER DREAM OF ACTING  THE WAY DONALD TRUMP DOES. IN AMERICA, WE DON'T BEGRUDGE PEOPLE BEING SUCCESSFUL, BUT WE  KNOW THEY SHOULDN'T DO IT BY DESTROYING OTHER PEOPLE'S DREAMS.   IF I WERE NOT  RUNNING AGAINST HIM FOR  PRESIDENT, I WOULD BE SAYING EXACTLY THE SAME THING. WE CANNOT PUT A PERSON LIKE THIS, WITH ALL HIS EMPTY PROMISES, IN A POSITION OF POWER  OVER OUR LIVES.  WE CAN'T LET HIM BANKRUPT AMERICA LIKE WE ARE ONE OF HIS FAILED CASINOS. WE CAN'T LET HIM ROLL THE DICE  WITH OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURES. LEADING AN ECONOMY AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS OURS, CREATING GROWTH THAT IS STRONG, FAIR, AND LASTING, IS ABOUT AS HARD A JOB AS THERE IS. IT TAKES PATIENCE AND CLEAR THINKING, A WILLINGNESS TO WORK ACROSS PARTY LINES, TO LEVEL  WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  IT TAKES REALLY CARING ABOUT  WHETHER WORKING FAMILIES WILL BE  BETTER OFF BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DO .  THINK OF FDR LEADING US OUT OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION. IMAGINE, ALL THE WORK THAT  REQUIRED, ALTHOUGH LEARNING AND  PATIENCE COME ALL THE HARD CALLS  DAY AFTER DAY FOR YEARS.  BUT HE STEERED US RIGHT, AND WE EMERGED STRONGER AND  BETTER-POSITIONED TO BUILD THE  GREATEST MIDDLE CLASS IN  HISTORY, AND LEAD THE WORLD  TOWARDS PISTE -- PEACE AND PROSPERITY. THINK OF PRESIDENT OBAMA IN 2000 NINE, NEWLY ELECTED, CONFRONTING THE GREATEST ECONOMIC CRISIS OF  OUR LIFETIMES. HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH CREATING IT. IT LANDED IN HIS LAP, AND HE HAD  TO BE FOCUSED, HE HAD TO RETURN TO BASICS TO GET US MOVING  AGAIN. HE FOUGHT FOR THE RECOVERY ACT  TO GET PEOPLE WORKING. HE PASSED WALL STREET REFORMS AND RELIEF FOR HOMEOWNERS, AND HE SAVED THE AUTO INDUSTRY.  TODAY, WE ARE ON A SURER FOOTING, READY TO SEIZE  TOMORROW. JUST IMAGINE, IF YOU CAN, DONALD TRUMP SITTING IN THE OVAL OFFICE. THE NEXT TIME AMERICA FACES A CRISIS. IMAGINE HIM BEING IN CHARGE WHEN YOUR JOBS AND SAVINGS ARE AT  STAKE. IS THIS WHO YOU WANT TO LEAD US  IN AN EMERGENCY? SOMEONE THIN-SKINNED AND QUICK  TO ANGER, WHO WOULD LIKELY BE ON  TWITTER, ATTACKING REPORTERS OR  BRINGING THE WHOLE REGULATORY  SYSTEM DOWN ON HIS CRITICS WHEN  HE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON FIXING  WHAT IS WRONG?  WOULD HE EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO? NOW, I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH THAT  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL MAKE  THE RIGHT DECISION.  MAKING DONALD TRUMP OUR  PRESIDENT WOULD UNDO MUCH OF THE  PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE, AND PUT  OUR ECONOMY AT RISK, AND BEYOND THAT, THIS ELECTION WILL SAY SOMETHING ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A  PEOPLE. DONALD TRUMP BELIEVES IN THE  WORST OF US.  HE THINKS WE ARE FEARFUL, NOT CONFIDENT.  THAT WE FAVOR DIVISION, NOT UNITY, WALLS, NOT BRIDGES, AND YESTERDAY, NOT TOMORROW. HE THINKS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD  IS TO GO BACK TO A PAST  PROSPERITY THAT LEFT A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT.  IN FACT, THE ONLY WAY FORWARD IS FORWARD. TOWARDS A 21ST CENTURY OF -- VERSION OF THE AMERICAN DREAM  WITH A SHARED PROSPERITY WHERE  NO ONE IS LEFT OUT OR LEFT BEHIND.  I BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA ALWAYS  MOVING TOWARDS THE FUTURE.   IF YOU BELIEVE AS I  DO, IN AN AMERICA THAT VALUES HARD WORK, TREAT PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY, OFFERS EVERYONE THE  CHANCE TO LIVE THEIR DREAMS,  CARES FOR THOSE IN NEED, WELL,  THE FORMULA FOR AMERICA'S SUCCESS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT WE ARE STRONGER, TOGETHER. AND WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT NOW , AND RECOMMIT OURSELVES TO  MAKING THAT IDEAL REAL IN OUR TIME.  THAT IS HOW WE WILL BUILD OUR ECONOMY, TO MAKE SURE IT DOES  WORK FOR EVERYONE AND TO MAKE  OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES STRONGER. WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT IN OUR  COUNTRY, NO ONE GETS LEFT BEHIND . SO LET'S CARRY THAT MESSAGE ACROSS AMERICA, AND LET'S FIGHT  HARD.  LET'S WIN IN NOVEMBER, AND THEN  LET'S GET TO WORK. MY FRIENDS, LET'S MAKE AMERICA WHAT WE KNOW IT CAN BE.  THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. ","Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton Economic Remarks in Columbus, Ohio"

THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M DILUTELY DELIGHTED TO BE   BACK IN -- ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED  TO BE BACK IN CLEVELAND AND BE   HERE AT THE INDUSTRIAL   INNOVATION CENTER. I HAD A CHANCE TO LEARN ABOUT  THE GREAT WORK YOU DO HERE.  I ESPECIALLY WANT TO APPLAUD TEAM WENDY FOR EVERYTHING YOU  DO TO PROTECT OUR TROOPS, FIRST  RESPONDSERS.  AND OTHERS FROM TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY.  IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THOSE WHO  PROTECT US.   THANK YOU, THANK YOU ALL.    IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK IN   CLEVELAND. I CAN HE WILL YOU THAT -- I CAN  TELL YOU THAT.  I WANT TO THANK YOUR EXTRAORDINARY SENATOR, MR.   BROWN, FOR --   FOR HIS LEADERSHIP, FOR THAT   VERY KIND AND GENEROUS INTRODUCTION. YOU ARE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE   HIM REPRESENTING YOU. I WANT TO THANK YOUR CONGRESSWOMAN, MARCIA FUDGE.  WHO IS BOTH INDOMITABLE AND INDEFAGTABLE.  SHE'S SUCH A TENACIOUS ADVOCATE  FOR THE PEOPLE SHE REPRESENTS. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE  MAYOR, MAYOR JACKSON, WHO IS HERE. COUNTY EXECUTIVE. AND I PARTICULARLY WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE PASSING OF GEORGE VOINOVICH. HE DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO SERVING THE PEOPLE OF OHIO, AS MAYOR OF CLEVELAND, AS GOVERNOR AND   SENATOR, AND WE SEND OUR PRAYERS AND SYMPATHY TO HIS FAMILY. I ALSO WANT TO THANK DAN MOORE, THE OWNER AND FOUNDER OF THIS COMPANY AND TEAM WENDY, FOR HIS  BELIEF IN CLEVELAND, FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO CREATE JOBS. I CAN'T WAIT TO WORK WITH HIM  TO DO MORE OF WHAT HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED HERE.  YOU KNOW, ORIGINALLY I HAD   INTENDED TO COME TO CLEVELAND UNDER VERY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. WE ARE HEADING INTO A GENERAL ELECTION THAT COULD BE THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL OF OUR LIFETIME. BUT TODAY IS NOT A DAY FOR POLITICS. ON SUNDAY AMERICANS WOKE UP TO A NIGHTMARE THAT'S BECOME MIND-NUMBINGLY FAMILIAR. ANOTHER ACT OF TERRORISM IN A PLACE NO ONE EXPECTED. A MADMAN FILLED WITH HATE, WITH  GUNS IN HIS HANDS, AND JUST A  HORRIBLE SENSE OF VENGEANCE AND  VINDICTIVENESS IN HIS HEART. APPARENTLY CONSUMED BY RAGE AGAINST LGBT AMERICANS, AND BY   EX TENS THE OPENNESS AND --  EXTENSION THE OPENNESS AND DIVERSITY THAT DEFINE OUR  AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE.  WE WILL LEARN MORE ABOUT THE   KILLER IN THE DAYS TO COME.  WE KNOW THAT HE PLEDGED  ALLEGIANCE TO ISIS, THAT THEY ARE NOW TAKING CREDIT AND THAT   PART OF THEIR STRATEGY IS TO RADICALIZE INDIVIDUALS AND ENCOURAGE ATTACKS AGAINST THE  UNITED STATES, EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT COORDINATED WITH ISIS LEADERSHIP.  BUT THERE'S A LOT WE STILL DON'T KNOW.  INCLUDING WHAT OTHER MIX OF MOTIVES DROVE HIM TO KILL. THE MORE WE LEARN ABOUT WHAT   HAPPENED, THE BETTER WE'LL BE  ABLE TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE   GOING FORWARD. IN THE DAYS AHEAD, WE WILL ALSO  LEARN MORE ABOUT THE MANY LIVES HE VICIOUSLY CUT SHORT. MANY OF THEM YOUNG PEOPLE JUST STARTING OUT IN THEIR LIVES. THEY WERE TRAVEL AGENTS AND PHARMACY TECHS, COLLEGE STUDENTS AND AMUSEMENT PARK  WORKERS, SONS AND DAUGHTERS, BROTHERS AND SISTERS, AND THEY   HAD ONE THING IN COMMON. THEY ALL HAD A LOT MORE TO GIVE.  WE SHOULD TAKE A MOMENT TODAY  AMID OUR BUSY LIVES TO THINK ABOUT THEM, TO PRAY FOR  EVERYONE WHO WAS KILLED, FOR THE WOUNDED, THOSE WHO ARE FIGHTING TO REGAIN THEIR LIVES AND FUTURES, FOR OUR FIRST RESPONDERS WHO WALKED INTO DANGER ONE MORE TIME.  AS A MOTHER, I CAN'T IMAGINE   WHAT THOSE FAMILIES ARE GOING THROUGH. BUT LET'S ALSO REMEMBER THE OTHER SCENES WE SAW ON SUNDAY. WE SAW THE FACES OF SOME OF  THOSE FIRST RESPONDERS WHO RUSHED INTO DANGER AND TRIED TO SAVE AS MANY PEOPLE AS THEY COULD. WE SAW SURVIVORS LIKE CHRIS  HANSON WHO RISKED THEIR LIVES TO HELP OTHERS. PEOPLE GATHERING OUTSIDE HOSPITALS TO COMFORT ANXIOUS FAMILY MEMBERS WAITING FOR NEWS  OF THEIR LOVES ONES, AND   WAITING TOO TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT THEY COULD DO TO MAKE SURE  THIS NEVER HAPPENED AGAIN. RELIGIOUS LEADERS CONDEMNING HATE AND APPEALING FOR PEACE. PEOPLE LINING UP TO DONATE BLOOD. AMERICANS REFUSING TO BE INTIMIDATED OR DIVIDED. YESTERDAY I CALLED THE MAYOR OF ORLANDO AND OFFERED MY SUPPORT AND MY APPRECIATION FOR THE LEADERSHIP THAT HE AND THE OTHER OFFICIALS HAVE SHOWN. THIS IS A MOMENT WHEN ALL  AMERICANS NEED TO STAND TOGETHER. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES WE ENDURE ATTACKS LIKE THIS, THE  HORROR NEVER FADES. THE MURDER OF INNOCENT PEOPLE BREAKS OUR HEARTS. TEARS AT OUR SENSE OF SECURITY.  AND MAKES US FURIOUS. NOW WE HAVE TO STEEL OUR RESOLVE TO RESPOND.  AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK   TO YOU ABOUT. HOW WE RESPOND.  THE ORLANDO TERRORIST MAY BE DEAD, BUT THE VIRUS THAT   POISONED HIS MIND REMAINS VERY MUCH ALIVE.  AND WE MUST ATTACK IT WITH CLEAR EYES, STEADY HANDS, UNWAVERING DETERMINATION AND   PRIDE IN OUR COUNTRY AND OUR VALUES.   I HAVE NO DOUBT, I HAVE NO DOUBT WE CAN MEET THIS CHALLENGE IF WE MEET IT TOGETHER. WHATEVER WE LEARN ABOUT THIS KILLER, HIS MOTIVES AND THE  DAYS -- IN THE DAYS AHEAD, WE  KNOW ALREADY THE  NOW, I  BELIEVE WEAPONS OF WAR HAVE NO PLACE ON OUR STREETS AND WE MAY  HAVE OUR DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT GUN SAFETY REGULATIONS, BUT WE   SHOULD ALL BE ABLE TO AGREE ON A FEW ESSENTIAL THINGS.  IF THE F.B.I. IS WATCHING YOU FOR SUSPECTED TERRORIST LINKS, HE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO JUST GO  BUY A GUN WITH NO QUESTIONS  ASKED.  AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO EXPLOIT LOOPHOLES AND BE -- NO BACKGROUND CHECKS BY BUYING ONLINE OR AT A GUN SHOW.  AND YET, IF YOU'RE TOO DANGEROUS TO GET ON A PLANE YOU  ARE TOO DANGEROUS TO BUY A GUN IN AMERICA.   NOW, I KNOW SOME WILL SAY THAT ASSAULT WEAPONS AND BACKGROUND   CHECKS ARE TOTALLY SEPARATE  ISSUES HAVING NOTHING TO DO  WITH TERRORISM. WELL, IN ORLANDO AND SAN   BERNARDINO, TERRORISTS USED ASSAULT WEAPONS. THE AR-15 AND THEY USED IT TO  KILL AMERICANS.  THAT WAS THE SAME ASSAULT WEAPON USED TO KILL THOSE  LITTLE CHILDREN IN SANDY HOOK. WE HAVE TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE THOSE WEAPONS OF WAR. AND THAT MAY NOT STOP EVERY SHOOTING OR EVERY TERRORIST  ATTACK BUT IT WILL STOP SOME   AND IT WILL SAVE LIVES AND IT WILL PROTECT OUR FIRST   RESPONDERS.    AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW I AM NOT GOING TO  STOP FIGHTING FOR THESE KINDS  OF PROVISIONS. NOW, THE THIRD AREA THAT DEMANDS ATTENTION IS PREVENTING RADICALIZATION AND COUNTERING  EFFORTS BY ISIS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST NETWORKS TO RECRUIT IN THE   UNITED STATES AND EUROPE. FOR STARTERS, IT IS LONG PAST TIME FOR THE SAUDIS, THE QUIT  AR IS AND THE KUWAITIS TO STOP THEIR CITIZENS FROM FUNDING EXTREMIST -- QATARIS AND THE QUATIES TO STOP THEIR CITIZENS FROM FUNDING EXTREMIST   TERRORISTS AND THEY SHOULD STOP SUPPORTING RADICAL SCHOOLS AND   MOSQUES AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAVE SENT TO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE   ON THE PATH TOWARD EXTREMISM.  WE ALSO HAVE TO USE ALL OUR CAPABILITIES TO COUNTER  JIHADIST PROPAGANDA ONLINE. THIS IS SOMETHING I SPENT A LOT  OF TIME ON AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL WORK WITH   OUR GREAT TECH COMPANIES FROM SILICON VALLEY TO BOSTON TO  STEP UP OUR GAME.  WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB INTERCEPTING ISIS'   COMMUNICATIONS, TRACKING AND ANALYZING SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS AND MAPPING JIHADIST NETWORKS  AS WELL AS PROMOTING CREDIBLE  VOICE WHO IS CAN PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES TO RADICALIZATION.  AND THERE IS MORE TO DO.  OFF-LINE AS WELL. SINCE 9/11, LAW ENFORCEMENT  AGENCIES HAVE WORKED HARD TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH MUSLIM AMERICAN COMMUNITIES.  MILLIONS OF PEACE-LOVING   MUSLIMS LIVE, WORK AND RAISE   THEIR FAMILIES ACROSS AMERICA. AND THEY ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO RECOGNIZE THE INSIDIOUS EFFECTS OF RADICALIZATION BEFORE IT'S  TOO LATE AND THE BEST POSITION   TO HELP US BLOCK IT. SO WE SHOULD BE INTENSIFYING   CONTACTS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES, NOT SCAPEGOATING OR ISOLATING  THEM.   LAST YEAR I VISITED A PILOT PROGRAM IN MINNEAPOLIS THAT  HELPS PARENTS, TEACHERS, IMAMS, MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND  OTHERS HELP RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS  OF RADICALIZATION IN YOUNG   PEOPLE AND WORK WITH LAW   ENFORCEMENT TO INTERVENE BEFORE  IT'S TOO LATE. I ALSO MEPPED WITH LOCAL LEADERS PURSUING INNOVATIVE  APPROACHES IN LOS ANGELES AND  OTHER PLACES AND WE NEED MORE EFFORTS LIKE THAT IN OTHER   CITIES ACROSS AMERICA. AND AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE F.B.I. HAS POINTED OUT WE  SHOULD AVOID ERODING TRUST IN  THAT COMMUNITY WHICH WILL ONLY MAKE LAW ENFORCEMENT'S JOB MORE DIFFICULT. INFLAMMATORY ANTI-MUSLIM RHETORIC AND THREATNK TO BAN THE FAMILIES -- THREATENING TO   BAN THE FAMILIES AND FRIENDS OF  MUSLIM AMERICANS AS WELL AS MILLIONS OF MUSLIM BUSINESS  PEOPLE AND TOURISTS FROM ENTERING OUR COUNTRY HURTS THE VAST MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS WHO   LOVE FREEDOM AND HATE TERROR. SO DOES SAYING THAT WE HAVE TO START SPECIAL SURVEILLANCE ON  OUR FELLOW AMERICANS BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGION.  IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT HATE CRIMES AGAINST AMERICAN MUSLIMS  AND MOSQUES HAVE TRIPLED AFTER   PARIS AND SAN BERNARDINO.  THAT'S WRONG AND IT'S ALSO   DANGEROUS. IT PLAYS RIGHT INTO THE TERRORISTS' HANDS. STILL, AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE,  NONE OF US CAN CLOSE OUR EYES  TO THE FACT THAT WE DO FACE  ENEMIES WHO USE THEIR DISTORTED VERSION OF ISLAM TO JUSTIFY  SLAUGHTERING INNOCENT PEOPLE.  THEY'D TAKE US BACK TO THE   STONE AGE IF THEY COULD JUST AS  THEY DID IN PARTS OF IRAQ AND  SYRIA. THE TERRORIST IN ORLANDO   TARGETED LGBT AMERICANS OUT OF HATE RED AND BIGOTRY -- HATRED AND BIGOTRY AND AN ATTACK ON   ANY AMERICAN IS AN ATTACK ON ALL AMERICANS.   AND I WANT TO SAY THIS TO ALL THE LGBT PEOPLE GRIEVING TODAY IN FLORIDA AND ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF ALLIES WHO WILL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK. AND I AM ONE OF THEM. FROM STONEWALL TO LARAMIE AND NOW ORLANDO, WE'VE SEEN TOO MANY EXAMPLES OF HOW THE   STRUGGLE TO LIVE FREELY, OPENLY AND WITHOUT FEAR HAS BEEN MET  BY VIOLENCE. WE HAVE TO STAND TOGETHER, BE  PROUD TOGETHER. THERE IS NO BETTER REBUKE TO THE TERRORISTS AND ALL THOSE WHO HATE. OUR OPEN, DIVERSE SOCIETY IS AN  ASSET IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST  TERRORISM, NOT A LIABILITY.  IT MAKES US STRONGER AND MORE  RESISTANT TO RADICALIZATION,   AND THIS RAISES A LARGER POINT   ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR  COUNTRY. AMERICA IS STRONGEST WHEN WE   ALL BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A   STAKE IN OUR COUNTRY AND OUR   FUTURE. THIS VISION HAS SUSTAINED US   FROM THE BEGINNING. THE BELIEF THAT, YES, WE ARE ALL CREATED EQUAL AND THE  JOURNEY WE HAVE MADE TO TURN   THAT INTO REALITY OVER THE   COURSE OF OUR HISTORY, THAT WE   ARE NOT A LAND OF WINNERS AND LOSERS, THAT WE ALL SHOULD HAVE  THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE UP TO OUR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL AND WE   HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP  OTHERS DO SO AS WELL.   YOU SEE, AS I LOOK AT AMERICAN HISTORY, I SEE THAT THIS HAS   ALWAYS BEEN A COUNTRY OF WE,   NOT ME. WE STAND TOGETHER BECAUSE WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. E PLURIBUS UNUM. EVER SINCE 13 SQUABBLING COLONIES PUT ASIDE THEIR DISAGREEMENTS AND UNITED BECAUSE THEY REALIZED THEY WERE GOING TO RISE TOGETHER OR FALL SEPARATELY.  GENERATION AFTER GENERATION HAS  FOUGHT AND MARCHED AND   ORGANIZED TO WIDEN THE CIRCLE OF DIGNITY AND OPPORTUNITY, ENDING SLAVERY, SECURING AND EXPANDING THE RIGHT TO VOTE, THROWING OPEN THE DOORS TO   EDUCATION, BUILDING THE GREATEST MIDDLE CLASS THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN. AND WE ARE STRONGER WHEN MORE PEOPLE CAN PARTICIPATE IN OUR DEMOCRACY.  AND WE ARE STRONGER WHEN   EVERYONE CAN SHARE IN THE  REWARDS OF OUR ECONOMY AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR COMMUNITY. WHEN WE BRIDGE OUR DIVIDE AND LIFT EACH OTHER UP INSTEAD OF  TEARING EACH OTHER DOWN. NOW, WE HAVE OVERCOME A LOT  TOGETHER AND WE WILL OVERCOME THE THREATS OF TERROR AND  RADICALIZATION AND ALL OF OUR OTHER CHALLENGES.  HERE IN OHIO AND ACROSS  AMERICA, I'VE LISTENED TO  PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THAT KEEP YOU UP AT NIGHT. THE BONDS THAT HOLD US TOGETHER  AS COMMUNITIES, AS ONE NATIONAL  COMMUNITY ARE STRAINED BY AN ECONOMY WITH TOO MUCH  INEQUALITY AND TOO LITTLE UPWARD MOBILITY. BY SOCIAL AND POLITICAL  DIVISIONS THAT HAVE DIMINISHED   OUR TRUST IN EACH OTHER AND OUR CONFIDENCE IN OUR SHARED FUTURE.  WELL, I HAVE HEARD THAT AND I  WANT YOU TO KNOW AS YOUR   PRESIDENT I WILL WORK EVERY DAY TO BREAK DOWN ALL THE BARRIERS HOLDING YOU BACK AN KEEPING US APART. WE'RE GOING TO GET AN ECONOMY  THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE, NOT   JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. WE ARE' -- WE'RE GOING TO FORGE A NEW SENSE OF CONNECTION AND  SHARED RESPONSIBILITY TO EACH OTHER AND OUR NATION. AND FINALLY, FINALLY LET ME  REMIND US ALL, I REMEMBER -- I REMEMBER HOW IT FELT ON THE DAY AFTER 9/11 AND I BET MANY OF   YOU DO AS WELL. AMERICANS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE RALLIED TOGETHER WITH A   SENSE OF COMMON PURPOSE ON SEPTEMBER 12 AND IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED.  WE HAD EACH OTHER'S BACKS. I WAS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK. THERE WAS A REPUBLICAN   PRESIDENT, A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR AND A REPUBLICAN  MAYOR. WE DID NOT ATTACK EACH OTHER.  WE WORKED WITH EACH OTHER TO   PROTECT OUR COUNTRY AND TO REBUILD OUR CITY.   PRESIDENT BUSH WENT TO A MUSLIM  COMMUNITY CENTER JUST SIX DAYS AFTER THE ATTACKS TO SEND A  MESSAGE OF UNITY AND SOLIDARITY  .  TO ANYONE WHO WANTED TO TAKE OUT THEIR ANGER ON OUR FELLOW  MUSLIMS AND NEIGHBORS, HE SAID,  THAT SHOULD NOT AND THAT WILL NOT STAND IN AMERICA.  IT IS TIME TO GET BACK TO THE  SPIRIT OF THOSE DAYS, THE  SPIRIT OF 9/12.  LET'S MAKE SURE WE KEEP LOOKING TO THE BEST OF OUR COUNTRY, TO THE BEST WITHIN EACH OF US, DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN  PRESIDENTS HAVE RISEN TO THE OCCASION IN THE FACE OF TRAGEDY. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE CALLED TO DO, MY FRIENDS, AND I AM SO CONFIDENT AND OPTIMISTIC THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WILL DO. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.

HELLO.   THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CROWD CHANTING  THANK YOU ALL . I HAVE TO SAY PINK NEVER LOOKED SO GOOD.   I WANT TO   THANK MY FRIEND AND YOUR   COURAGEOUS LEADER. CECILLE IS THE DEFINITION OF GRACE UNDER PRESSURE. SHE HAS PROVEN THAT TIME AND   TIME AGAIN IN THE COURSE OF HER  CAREER AND PARTICULARLY OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW YEARS. SHE REALLY IS LIKE ANOTHER GREAT AMERICAN, HER MOTHER, ANN RICHARDS, WAS A FRIEND OF MINE AND I JUST WISH SHE WAS HERE TO SEE THIS ELECTION BECAUSE SHE  WOULD HAVE DONALD TRUMP TWEETING DOUBLE TIME. .  . FOR THE FIRST TIME A WOMAN WILL  BE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE FOR  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND YESTERDAY I HAD THE GREAT  HONOR OF BEING ENDORSED BY   PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE   PRESIDENT BIDEN.   AND BY  SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN.  SO IT'S BEEN A BIG WEEK, AND THERE'S NOWHERE I'D RATHER END IT THAN RIGHT HERE WITH THE  PLANNED PARENTHOOD ACTION FUND.  I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE ENTIRE  PLANNED PARENTHOOD FAMILY. YOU MADE THIS CAMPAIGN YOUR OWN  , WHETHER YOU KNOCKED ON DOORS IN IOWA OR RALLIED IN CALIFORNIA, THIS VICTORY BELONGS TO ALL OF YOU. AND IT BELONGS TO THE 1,000  YOUNG ACTIVISTS WHO CAME TOGETHER IN PITTSBURGH LAST MONTH TO GET ORGANIZED.  [CHEERS AND  IT BELONGS TO THE STAFF, THE DONORS AND TO THE PROVIDERS, PROVIDERS LIKE DR. DERMISH IN TEXAS WHO CALLED  OUT DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE SAID  WOMEN SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR HAVING ABORTIONS AND THE OPEN  LETTER SHE WROTE DEFENDING HER   PATIENTS' RIGHTS TO MAKE THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE DECISIONS  SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR   EVERY POLITICIAN IN AMERICA. AND I AM DEEPLY CONSCIOUS OF   THE REALITY THAT THIS VICTORY BELONGS TO GENERATIONS OF BRAVE  WOMEN AND MEN WHO FOUGHT FOR THE RADICAL IDEA THAT WOMEN  SHOULD DETERMINE OUR OWN LIVES AND FUTURES, AND IT BELONGS TO THE WOMEN AND MEN WHO CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THAT IDEA TODAY EVEN IN THE FACE OF THREATS AND VIOLENCE.  WHEN A MAN WHO NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAD A GUN KILLED THREE  PEOPLE AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN  COLORADO SPRINGS, LEADERS IN THIS ROOM VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO   KEEP HEALTH CENTERS ACROSS AMERICA OPEN THE NEXT DAY AND THE C.E.O. --    THE C.E.O. OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD ROCKY MOUNTAINS MADE A PROMISE TO  PATIENTS IN COLORADO AND BEYOND WHEN SHE SAID, OUR DOORS AND OUR HEARTS STAY OPEN. THAT IS REALLY WHAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS ALL ABOUT. SO TODAY I WANT TO START BY  SAYING SOMETHING YOU DON'T HEAR OFTEN ENOUGH. THANK YOU.   THANK YOU.  THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE FOR WOMEN NO MATTER THEIR RACE,  SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR IMMIGRATION STATUS.  THANK YOU FOR BEING THEIR FOR  NATRASHA MCQUEEN IN BROOKLYN WHO SAID PLANNED PARENTHOOD CAUGHT HER BREAST CANCER WHEN SHE WAS JUST 33 YEARS OLD AND  SAVED HER LIFE.  THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE FOR  COLLEGE STUDENTS GETTING S.T.D. TESTING, THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO  HAVE THE TOUGH QUESTIONS THAT  THEY'RE AFRAID TO ASK THEIR PARENTS, THE SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS WHO TURN TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOR COMPASSIONATE CARE, THE TRANSGENDERED TEENS  WHO COME FOR AN APPOINTMENT AND FIND THE FIRST PLACE WHERE THEY  CAN TRULY BE THEMSELVES. THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE FOR YOUR COMMUNITIES, WHETHER THAT   MEANS TAKING ON HOSTILE POLITICIANS IN LOUISIANA OR HANDING OUT CLEAN DRINKING   WATER IN FLINT, MICHIGAN.    AND THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE FOR EVERY  WOMAN IN EVERY STATE WHO HAS TO MISS WORK, DRIVE HUNDREDS OF MILES SOMETIMES, ENDURE CRUEL MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY WAITING PERIODS, WALK PAST ANGRY PROTESTERS TO EXERCISE HER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION.    I'VE BEEN PROUD TO STAND WITH PLANNED  PARENTHOOD FOR A LONG TIME, AND  AS PRESIDENT I WILL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK.   BECAUSE I   KNOW THAT FOR A CENTURY PLANNED  PARENTHOOD HAS WORKED TO MAKE  SURE THAT WOMEN, MEN, YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COUNT ON YOU CAN LEAD THEIR BEST LIVES HEALTHY,   SAFE AND FREE TO FOLLOW THEIR DREAMS.  JUST THINK WHEN PLANNED PARENTHOOD WAS FOUNDED, WOMEN  COULDN'T VOTE OR SERVE ON JURIES IN MOST STATES. IT WAS ILLEGAL EVEN TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL  , LET ALONE PRESCRIBE IT.  BUT PEOPLE MARCHED AND ORGANIZED. THEY PROTESTED UNJUST LAWS AND   IN SOME CASES EVEN WENT TO PRISON, AND SLOWLY BUT SURELY  AMERICA CHANGED FOR THE BETTER. 51 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK, THANKS   TO A PLANNED PARENTHOOD EMPLOYEE NAMEDESS TELL -- NAMED ESTELLE GRIZWALD --    THE SUPREME COURT LEGALIZED BIRTH CONTROL FOR MARRIED COUPLES ACROSS  WHEN I USED TO TEACH LAW AND I WOULD POINT   TO THIS CASE, A LOOK OF TOTAL  BEWILLEDERMENT WOULD COME  ACROSS MY STUDENTS' FACES, AND   NOT LONG AFTER THAT, ROE V.  WADE GUARANTEED THE RIGHT TO SAFE, LEGAL ABORTION SO YOUNG WOMEN WERE NO LONGER DYING IN EMERGENCY ROOMS AND BACK ALIES   FROM BOTCHED ABORTIONS AND THIS  IS A FACT THAT IS NOT OFTEN HEARD BUT I HOPE YOU WILL REPEAT IT. AMERICA'S MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE DROPPED DRAMATICALLY AND  IT TURNS OUT BEING ABLE TO PLAN THEIR FAMILIES NOT ONLY SAVED WOMEN'S LIVES, IT ALSO   TRANSFORMED THEM BECAUSE IT  MEANT THAT WOMEN WERE ABLE TO GET EDUCATION, BUILD CAREERS, ENTER NEW FIELDS AND RISE AS   FAR AS THEIR TALENT AND HARD WORK WOULD TAKE THEM.  ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT   FOLLOWED WHEN WOMEN ARE ABLE TO STAY HEALTHY AND CHOOSE WHETHER AND WHEN TO BECOME MOTHERS.    AND YOU KNOW SO WELL, TODAY THE PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN WHO FINISH COLLEGE IS   SIX TIMES WHAT IT WAS BEFORE BIRTH CONTROL WAS LEGAL. WOMEN REPRESENT HALF OF ALL  COLLEGE GRADUATES IN AMERICA   AND NEARLY HALF OUR LABOR FORCE AND OUR WHOLE ECONOMY THEN IS BETTER OFF.  THE MOVEMENT OF WOMEN INTO THE   WORK FORCE, A PAID WORK FORCE OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN $3.5   TRILLION IN GROWTH IN OUR ECONOMY.   AND HERE'S  ANOTHER FACT THAT DOESN'T GET ENOUGH ATTENTION. UNINTENDED PREGNANCY, TEEN   PREGNANCY AND ABORTION RATES ARE AT ALL-TIME RECORD LOWS. [CHEERS AND  THAT REALITY AND STUDIES CONFIRM WHAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD KNEW ALL ALONG -- ACCURATE SEX EDUCATION AND EFFECTIVE, AFFORDABLE  CONTRACEPTION WORK. AND YOU KNOW --    IT WASN'T SO LONG AGO THAT REPUBLICANS AND  DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY STOOD TOGETHER ON THESE ISSUES. BACK IN THE 1990'S WHEN I  HELPED CREATE THE NATIONAL   CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT TEEN PREGNANCY I WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS TO GET IT DONE. NOW, THINGS FEEL QUITE   DIFFERENT NOW, DON'T THEY? INSTEAD OF WORKING TO CONTINUE   THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE, REPUBLICANS, LED NOW BY DONALD   TRUMP -- [AUDIENCE  ARE WORKING   TO REVERSE IT. WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAYS, LET'S MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, THAT   IS CODE FOR, LET'S TAKE AMERICA  BACKWARD, BACK TO A TIME --    WHEN  OPPORTUNITY AND DIGNITY WERE   RESERVED FOR SOME, NOT ALL,  BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN ABORTION WAS ILLEGAL, WOMEN HAD FAR FEWER OPTIONS AND LIFE FOR TOO   MANY WOMEN AND GIRLS WAS LIMITED. WELL, DONALD, THOSE DAYS ARE   OVER.    WE ARE NOT GOING -- WE ARE NOT GOING TO   LET DONALD TRUMP OR ANYONE ELSE TURN BACK THE CLOCK, AND THAT MEANS WE'VE GOT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE, RIGHT NOW ACROSS THE COUNTRY, RIGHTS THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE FOR   GRANTED ARE UNDER ATTACK. ANY DAY NOW THE SUPREME COURT WILL RULE ON THE TEXAS LAW THAT IMPOSES BURDENSOME AND MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY REQUIREMENTS ON ABORTION   PROVIDERS. IF THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE  ALLOWED TO STAND, 5.4 MILLION WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE WILL BE LEFT WITH ABOUT 10 HEALTH   CENTERS THAT PROVIDE ABORTION  IN A STATE THE SIZE OF FRANCE. IT IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE TO   ROE V. WADE IN A GENERATION. IT'S ALSO YET ANOTHER REMINDER OF WHAT'S AT STAKE ON THE  SUPREME COURT. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DONE HIS   JOB AND NOMINATED MERRICK  GARLAND TO BE THE NINTH  JUSTICE. IT'S TIME FOR THE SENATE REPUBLICANS TO DO THEIR JOB. [CHEERS AND  THE SENATE  SHOULD GIVE JUDGE GARLAND THE  HEARING HE DESERVES. NOW, MEANWHILE, IN JUST THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2016, STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY INTRODUCED MORE THAN 400 RESTRICTIONS ON ABORTION. 11 STATES HAVE DEFUNDED PLANNED  PARENTHOOD IN THE LAST YEAR, CUTTING SOME WOMEN OFF FROM THEIR ONLY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER AND, OF COURSE, ON A NATIONAL LEVEL, REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS HAVE BEEN WILLING TO SHUT DOWN THE ENTIRE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  OVER PLANNED PARENTHOOD FUNDING. HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED THAT THE SAME POLITICIANS WHO ARE   AGAINST SEX EDUCATION, BIRTH CONTROL AND SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION ARE ALSO AGAINST  POLICIES THAT WOULD MAKE IT  EASIER TO RAISE A CHILD, LIKE PAID FAMILY LEAVE?   THEY ARE FOR LIMITED GOVERNMENT  EVERYWHERE EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES  TO INTERFERING WITH WOMEN'S  CHOICES AND RIGHTS.  [CHEERS AND  WELL, I'M   HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU WE NEED   TO BE JUST AS DETERMINED AS  THEY ARE.  WE NEED TO DEFEND PLANNED PARENTHOOD AGAINST PARTISAN  ATTACKS. IF RIGHT-WING POLITICIANS ACTUALLY CARED AS MUCH ABOUT   PROTECTING WOMEN'S HEALTH AS THEY SAY THEY DO, THEY'D JOIN  ME IN CALLING FOR MORE FEDERAL   FUNDING FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD.    WE ALSO NEED TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE EROSION OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AT THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL  LEVELS, ENSURE THAT PATIENTS AND STAFF CAN SAFELY WALK INTO HEALTH CENTERS WITHOUT HARASSMENT OR VIOLENCE.  WE NEED TO --    WE NEED TO  STAND UP FOR ACCESS TO   AFFORDABLE CONTRACEPTION WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM POLITICIANS OR EMPLOYERS.    AND LET'S INVEST IN LONG ACTING REVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTIVE SO EVERY WOMAN CAN CHOOSE THE METHOD THAT IS BEST FOR HER.   LET'S   STRENGTHEN AND IMPROVE THE   AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH  COVERS 20 MILLIONS AMERICANS AND HELPS THROUGH NO CO-PAY PREVENTIVE CARE.   AND LET'S   TAKE ACTION TO STOP THE SPREAD   OF THE ZIKA VIRUS WHICH  THREATENS THE HEALTH OF  CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN.   LET'S REPEAL  LAWS LIKE THE HYDE AMENDMENT   THAT MAKE IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE   --   [CHEERS AND  MAKE IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR  LOW-INCOME WOMEN, DISPROPORTIONATELY WOMEN OF  COLOR TO EXERCISE THEIR FULL   REPRODUCTIVE RIGHT.  AND IT IS WORTH SAYING, AGAIN, DEFENDING WOMEN'S HEALTH MEANS DEFENDING ACCESS TO ABORTION, NOT JUST IN THEORY BUT IN REALITY.  WE KNOW -- WE KNOW THAT RESTRICTING ACCESS DOESN'T MAKE  WOMEN LESS LIKELY TO END A PREGNANCY. IT JUST MAKES ABORTION LESS SAFE, AND THAT THEN THREATENS WOMEN'S LIVES. FOR TOO LONG ISSUES LIKE THESE   HAVE BEEN DISMISSED BY MANY AS WOMEN'S ISSUES, AS THOUGH THAT SOMEHOW MAKES THEM LESS WORTHY, SECONDARY. WELL, YES, THESE ARE WOMEN'S   ISSUES. THEY'RE ALSO FAMILY ISSUES. THEY'RE ECONOMIC I SHALLOUS. THERE ARE JUSTICE ISSUES.  THEY ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR  COUNTRY AND OUR FUTURE.    -- THEY'RE ECONOMIC ISSUES.  THEY'RE JUSTICE ISSUES.  THEY ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR  COUNTRY AND OUR FUTURE.  AND BEYOND THESE SPECIFIC ISSUES WE NEED TO GET INCOMES RISING, INCLUDING THE MINIMUM  WAGE, WHICH DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS WOMEN. WE NEED TO FINALLY GUARANTEE   EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN'S WORK.    WE NEED TO PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH A PATH TO  CITIZENSHIP THAT KEEPS FAMILIES TOGETHER.  CHERS CHEERS  AND WE NEED   TO BREAK DOWN ALL THE BARRIERS OF DISCRIMINATION AND SUSTAINIC  RACISM THAT HOLD TOO MANY  AMERICANS BACK.  [CHEERS AND  AND WE NEED   TO COME TOGETHER TO STOP THE   EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE THAT  IS STALKING OUR COUNTRY. NO PARENT SHOULD LIVE IN FEAR THAT THEIR CHILD WILL BE HURT OR KILLED BY GUN VIOLENCE. 33,000 AMERICANS ARE KILLED EVERY YEAR. I'VE MET SO MANY MOTHERS ON  THIS CAMPAIGN WHO HAVE LOST  THEIR OWN CHILDREN.  WE OWE IT TO THEM TO PROTECT   OUR KIDS NO MATTER WHAT ZIP  CODE THEY LIVE IN, AND THAT IS GOING TO REQUIRE --    STANDING UP   TO THE GUN LOBBY AND MAKING  THIS A VOTING ISSUE. YOU KNOW, ALL THE ISSUES THAT  WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY ARE CONNECTED. THEY INTERSECT AND THAT'S WHY  I'M GRATEFUL TO THE  REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE LEADERS IN  THIS ROOM AND ACROSS AMERICA.  [CHEERS AND  BECAUSE YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW THAT ALL THESE ISSUES GO STRAIGHT TO THAT   FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION, WHETHER WE BELIEVE WHETHER WOMEN OF ALL RACES, BACKGROUNDS AND INCOME LEVELS DESERVE AN EQUAL SHOT IN  LIFE. NOW, THAT'S WHAT I BHEEB AND YOU WON'T BE SURPRISED -- BELIEVE AND YOU WON'T BE   SURPRISED TO HEAR DONALD TRUMP BELIEVES SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT. HE ACTUALLY THINKS GUARANTEEING PAID FAMILY LEAVE WOULD LEAVE AMERICA LESS COMPETITIVE. HE SAYS IF WOMEN WANT EQUAL PAY WE SHOULD JUST -- AND THIS IS A  QUOTE -- DO AS GOOD A JOB AS MEN, AS IF WE WEREN'T ALREADY. HE WANTS TO APPOINT JUSTICES WHO WOULD OVERTURN ROE V. WADE. HE, OF COURSE, WANTS TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD.  AND HE WANTS TO GO AFTER SO MANY OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS   WE HAVE, INCLUDING SAFE AND  LEGAL ABORTION.  AND HE ACTUALLY SAID WOMEN   SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR HAVING ABORTIONS. NOW, ONCE HE SAID THAT, THERE WAS AN OUTCRY, AS THERE SHOULD   HAVE BEEN, AND HE TRIED TO WALK  BACK HIS COMMENTS. HE'S DOING THAT A LOT  BUT ANYONE WHO WOULD SO CASUALLY AGREE TO THE IDEA OF PUNISHING WOMEN LIKE IT WAS NOTHING TO HIM, THE  MOST OBVIOUS THING IN THE  WORLD, THAT'S SOMEONE WHO  DOESN'T HOLD WOMEN IN HIGH   REGARD. BECAUSE IF HE DID, HE WOULD  TRUST WOMEN TO MAKE THE RIGHT  DECISION FOR OURSELVES.    BUT DON'T WORRY. DONALD ASSURES US THAT AS  PRESIDENT HE WILL BE, AND I  QUOTE AGAIN, THE BEST FOR WOMEN.   AND HE WANTS  TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND WIPE OUT SAFE, LEGAL ABORTION HAS NOTHING IDEA WHAT'S BEST FOR WOMEN AND THIS   IS SOMEONE THAT'S CALLED WOMEN PIGS, DOGS AND DISGUSTING  ANIMALS. KIND OF HARD TO IMAGINE COUNTING ON HIM TO RESPECT OUR   FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS WHEN HE SAYS  PREGNANT WOMEN ARE AN  INCONVENIENCE TO THEIR   EMPLOYER.  WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT HOW HE  VALUES WOMEN, OUR WORK, OUR CONTRIBUTIONS? WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A   CONCERTED, PERSISTENT ASSAULT ON WOMEN'S HEALTH ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. AND WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES   AND YOU HAVE TO ASK EVERYONE   YOU COME IN CONTACT WITH, DO WE WANT TO PUT OUR HEALTH, OUR LIVES, OUR FUTURES IN DONALD TRUMP'S HANDS? NOW, THESE QUESTIONS ARE NOT   HYPOTHETICAL. EVERY WOMAN AND EVERYONE WHO   CARES ABOUT WOMEN WILL ANSWER THEM WHEN THEY VOTE IN   NOVEMBER. NOW, WHEN I TALK LIKE THIS,  DONALD TRUMP LIKES TO SAY I'M PLAYING THE WOMAN CARD, AND I  LIKE TO SAY, IF FIGHTING FOR   EQUAL PAY, PLANNED PARENTHOOD  AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE OUR OWN HEALTH DECISIONS IS PLAYING THE WOMAN CARD THEN DEAL ME IN.    NOW, MY FRIENDS, I COME TO THIS ISSUE,   OF COURSE, AS A WOMAN, A MOTHER AND A GRANDMOTHER NOW, BUT I ALSO COME TO IT AS A FORMER FIRST LADY, SENATOR AND SECRETARY OF STATE.  AND IN THOSE ROLES --    IN THOSE  ROLES, I TRAVELED TO PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE GIRLS ARE  MARRIED OFF AS SOON AS THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BEAR CHILDREN, PLACES WHERE THE DENIAL OF   FAMILY PLANNING CONSIGNS WOMEN TO LIVES OF HARDSHIP.  I VISITED COUNTRIES WHERE  GOVERNMENTS HAVE STRICTLY REGULATED WOMEN'S REPRODUCTION EITHER FORCING WOMEN TO HAVE   ABORTIONS OR FORCING WOMEN TO  GET PREGNANT AND GIVE BIRTH. EVERYTHING I HAVE SEEN HAS CONVINCED ME THAT LIFE IS  FISCAL YEAR -- FREER, FAIRER, SAFER AND FAR MORE HUMANE WHEN   WOMEN ARE EMPOWERED TO MAKE THEIR OWN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH DECISIONS.   AND   EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD FROM   DONALD TRUMP OFTEN SEEMS TO  ECHO OTHER LEADERS WHO HAVE A  VERY DIFFERENT VIEW OF WOMEN.  THE LATE GREAT MAYA ANGELOU SAID, WHEN SOMEONE SHOWS YOU   WHO THEY ARE, BELIEVE THEM THE   FIRST TIME.  [CHEERS AND  DONALD TRUMP  HAS SHOWN US WHO HE IS AND WE  SURE SHOULD BELIEVE HIM. AND IT'S NOT JUST ON   REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. DONALD TRUMP WOULD TAKE US IN  THE WRONG DIRECTION ON SO MANY ISSUES WE CARE ABOUT -- ECONOMIC JUSTICE, WORKERS'   RIGHTS, CIVIL RIGHTS, HUMAN  RIGHTS, THE ENVIRONMENT, ALL OF  THAT IS ON THE LINE IN THIS  ELECTION. WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAYS A DISTINGUISHED JUDGE BORN IN  INDIANA CAN'T DO HIS JOB BECAUSE OF HIS MEXICAN HERITAGE OR MOCKS A REPORTER WITH DISABILITIES OR DENIGRATES MUSLIMS AND IMMIGRANTS, IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING WE STAND FOR. HE DOES NOT SEE ALL AMERICANS AS AMERICANS. SO THIS ELECTION ISN'T ABOUT THE SAME OLD FIGHTS BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. THEY'LL BE THERE. DON'T WORRY.   BUT THIS  ELECTION IS PROFOUNDLY DIFFERENT. IT IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A  NATION. IT'S ABOUT MILLIONS OF   AMERICANS COMING TOGETHER TO SAY, WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. SO HERE'S MY PROMISE TO YOU TODAY. I WILL BE YOUR PARTNER IN THIS ELECTION AND OVER THE LONG HAUL  . TOGETHER WE'RE TAKING ON THE   ATTACKS AND TOGETHER WE WILL COME OUT STRONGER, JUST LIKE   PLANNED PARENTHOOD HAS TIME AND  AGAIN. [CHEERS AND  AND TOGETHER  WE'RE GOING TO UNIFY OUR COUNTRY, STOP DONALD TRUMP AND   FIGHT FOR AN AMERICA WHERE WE  LIFT EACH OTHER UP INSTEAD OF  TEARING EACH OTHER DOWN. WE ARE NOT GOING TO JUST BREAK THAT HIGHEST AND HARDEST GLASS   CEILING. WE'RE GOING TO BREAK DOWN ALL THE BARRIERS THAT HOLD WOMEN AND FAMILIES BACK BECAUSE YOU  KNOW WE DO BELIEVE WE'RE STRONGER WHEN EVERY FAMILY IN EVERY COMMUNITY KNOWS THEY'RE  NOT ON THEIR OWN.  WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER, AND  WE'RE GOING TO MAKE HISTORY TOGETHER IN NOVEMBER.  THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!        ",Hillary Clinton Remarks at Planned Parenthood Action Fund

IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE BACK IN BROOKLYN. HERE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL BUILDING. AND, IT MAY BE HARD TO SEE TONIGHT BUT WE ARE ALL STANDING UNDER A GLASS CEILING RIGHT NOW.   BUT DON'T WORRY, WE ARE NOT SMASHING THIS ONE. THANKS TO YOU WE HAVE REACHED A MILESTONE. THE FIRST TIME IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY THAT A WOMAN WILL BE A MAJOR PARTY NOMINEE.   TONIGHT VICTORY IS NOT ABOUT ONE PERSON IT BELONGS TO GENERATIONS OF WOMEN AND MEN WHO STRUGGLED AND SACRIFICED AND MADE THIS MOMENT POSSIBLE. IN OUR COUNTRY IT STARTED RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK AT A PLACE CALLED SENECA FALLS IN 1848.   WHEN A SMALL BUT DETERMINED GROUP OF WOMEN AND MEN CAME TOGETHER WITH THE IDEA THAT WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL RIGHTS AND THEY SET IT FORTH IN SOMETHING CALLED ""THE DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS,"" AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN HUMAN HISTORY THAT THAT KIND OF DECLARATION OCCURRED. SO, WE ALL OWE SO MUCH TO THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE US. AND, TONIGHT BELONGS TO ALL OF YOU.   I WANT TO THANK ALL THE VOLUNTEERS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS, THE ACTIVISTS AND ORGANIZERS. WHO SUPPORTED OUR CAMPAIGN IN EVERY STATE AND TERRITORY. THANKS ESPECIALLY TO OUR FRIENDS IN NEW JERSEY FOR SUCH A LARGE AND RESOUNDING VICTORY TONIGHT.   THANKS FOR TALKING TO YOUR NEIGHBORS AND MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS. YOUR EFFORTS HAVE PRODUCED A STRONG MAJORITY OF THE POPULAR VOTE. VICTORIES AND A MAJORITY OF THE CONTESTS AND AFTER TONIGHT I MAJORITY OF PLEDGED DELEGATES.   I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PEOPLE ACROSS OUR COUNTRY WHO'VE TAKEN THE TIME TO TALK WITH ME. I HAVE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT YOU AND HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THOSE PERSISTENT PROBLEMS AND TO THE UNFINISHED PROMISE OF AMERICA THAT YOU ARE LIVING WITH. SO MANY OF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE OUT THERE ON YOUR OWN. THAT NO ONE HAS YOUR BACK. WELL I DO. I HEAR YOU AND I SEE YOU.   AS YOUR PRESIDENT I WILL ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK.   I WANT TO CONGRATULATE SENATOR SANDERS FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY CAMPAIGN HE HAS RUN.   HE HAS SPENT HIS LONG CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE FIGHTING FOR PROGRESSIVE CAUSES AND PROGRESSIVE PRINCIPLES. HE HAS EXCITED MILLIONS OF VOTERS INCLUDING YOUNG PEOPLE. SENATOR SANDERS, HIS CAMPAIGN AND THE VIGOROUS DEBATES THAT WE HAVE HAD ABOUT HOW TO RAISE INCOMES, REDUCE INEQUALITY, INCREASE UPWARD MOBILITY -- HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND FOR AMERICA.   THIS HAS BEEN A HARD-FOUGHT DEEPLY FELT CAMPAIGN. BUT WHETHER YOU SUPPORTED ME OR SENATOR SANDERS OR ONE OF THE REPUBLICANS WE ALL NEED TO KEEP WORKING TOWARD A BETTER FAIRER STRONGER AMERICA. NOW I KNOW, IT NEVER FEELS GOOD TO PUT YOUR HEART INTO A CAUSE OR CANDIDATE YOU BELIEVE IN AND TO COME UP SHORT. I KNOW THAT FEELING WELL.   BUT AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO THE BATTLE THAT WAITS. LET'S REMEMBER ALL THAT UNITES US. WE ALL WANT AN ECONOMY WITH MORE OPPORTUNITY AND LESS INEQUALITY. WHERE WALL STREET CAN NEVER WRECK MAIN STREET AGAIN. WE WANT A GOVERNMENT THAT LISTENS TO THE PEOPLE, NOT THE POWER BROKERS WHICH MEANS GETTING UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY OUT OF POLITICS. WE ALL WANT A SOCIETY THAT IS TOLERANT, INCLUSIVE, AND FAIR. WE ALL BELIEVE THAT AMERICANS SUCCEED WHEN MORE PEOPLE SHARE IN OUR PROSPERITY. WHEN MORE PEOPLE HAVE A VOICE IN OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM. WHEN MORE PEOPLE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT COOPERATION IS BETTER THAN CONFLICT. UNITY IS BETTER THAN DIVISION, EMPOWERMENT IS BETTER THAN RESENTMENT, AND BRIDGES ARE BETTER THAN WALLS.   IT IS A SYMPTOM -- IS A SIMPLE BUT POWERFUL IDEA. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER AND THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION ARE HIGH AND THE CHOICE IS CLEAR. DONALD TRUMP IS TEMPERAMENTALLY UNFIT TO BE PRESIDENT.   AND, HE IS NOT JUST TRYING TO BUILD A WALL BETWEEN AMERICA AND MEXICO. HE'S TRYING TO WALL OFF AMERICANS FROM EACH OTHER. WHEN HE SAYS, ""LET'S MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,"" THAT IS CODE FOR ""LET'S TAKE AMERICA BACKWARDS."" BACK TO A TIME WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY AND DIGNITY WERE RESERVED FOR SOME, NOT ALL. PROMISING HIS SUPPORTERS AN ECONOMY HE CAN NOT RE-CREATE. WE HOWEVER, WE WANT TO WRITE THE NEXT ARE IN AMERICAN GREATNESS WITH A 21ST CENTURY PROSPERITY WHICH LIFTS EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN LEFT OUT AND LEFT BEHIND INCLUDING THOSE WHO MAY NOT VOTE FOR US BY TWO DESERVES THEIR CHANCE TO MAKE A NEW BEGINNING.   WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAYS A DISTINGUISHED JUDGE BORN IN INDIANA CANNOT DO HIS JOB BECAUSE OF HIS MEXICAN HERITAGE --    -- OR HE MOCKS A REPORTER WITH DISABILITIES, OR CALLS WOMEN ""PIGS,"" IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING WE STAND FOR. BECAUSE WE WANT AN AMERICA WHERE EVERYONE IS TREATED WITH RESPECT AND WHERE THEIR WORK IS VALUED.   IT'S CLEAR THAT DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T BELIEVE WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. HE HAS ABUSED HIS PRIMARY OPPONENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES, ATTACKED THE PRESS FOR ASKING TOUGH QUESTIONS, DENIGRATED MUSLIMS AND IMMIGRANTS. HE WANTS TO WIN BY STOKING FEAR AND RUBBING SALT IN WOUNDS. REMINDING US DAILY, JUST HOW GREAT HE IS. WELL, WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD LIFT EACH OTHER UP. NOT TEAR EACH OTHER DOWN.   WE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO GIVE AMERICANS A RAISE NOT COMPLAIN THAT HARD WORKING PEOPLE'S WAGES ARE TOO HIGH. WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH STUDENT DEBT, NOT PILE MORE ON OUR NATIONAL DEBT WITH GIVEAWAYS TO THE SUPER-WEALTHY. WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO MAKE AMERICA THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPER POWER OF THE 21ST CENTURY. NOT INSIST THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX. TO BE GREAT, WE CAN'T BE SMALL. WE HAVE TO BE AS BIG AS THE VALUES THAT DEFINE AMERICA AND WE ARE A BIG HEARTED, FAIR MINDED COUNTRY. WE TEACH OUR CHILDREN THAT THIS IS ONE NATION UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. NOT JUST FOR PEOPLE WHO LOOK A CERTAIN WAY OR WORSHIP A CERTAIN WAY OR LOVE A CERTAIN WAY. INDIVISIBLE. THIS ELECTION IS NOT, HOWEVER, ABOUT THE SAME OLD FIGHT BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. THIS ELECTION IS DIFFERENT. IT REALLY IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. IT'S ABOUT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS COMING TOGETHER TO SAY, WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. WE WON'T LET THIS HAPPEN IN AMERICA. IF YOU AGREE, WHETHER YOU'RE DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN OR INDEPENDENT, I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN US. IN JUST A FEW WEEKS, WE WILL MEET IN PHILADELPHIA WHICH GAVE BIRTH TO OUR NATION BACK IN THAT HOT SUMMER OF 1776. THOSE EARLY PATRIOTS KNEW THEY WOULD ALL RISE OR FALL TOGETHER. WELL TODAY THAT MORE TRUE THAN EVER. OUR CAMPAIGN WILL TAKE THIS MESSAGE TO EVERY CORNER OF OUR COUNTRY. WE'RE STRONGER WHEN OUR ECONOMY WORKS FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. WITH GOOD PAYING JOBS AND GOOD SCHOOLS IN EVERY ZIP CODE AND A REAL COMMITMENT TO ALL FAMILIES AND ALL REGIONS OF OUR NATION.   WE ARE STRONGER WHEN WE WORK WITH OUR ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD TO KEEP US SAFE AND WE ARE STRONGER WHEN WE RESPECT EACH OTHER AND LISTEN TO EACH OTHER AND ACT WITH A SENSE OF COMMON PURPOSE.   WE'RE STRONGER WHEN EVERY FAMILY AND EVERY COMMUNITY KNOWS THEY'RE NOT ON THEIR OWN. BECAUSE WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER. IT REALLY DOES TAKE A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD. AND TO BUILD A STRONGER FUTURE FOR US ALL. I LEARNED THIS A LONG TIME AGO FROM THE BIGGEST INFLUENCE IN MY LIFE, MY MOTHER. SHE WAS MY ROCK FROM THE DAY I WAS BORN UNTIL THE DAY SHE LEFT US. SHE OVERCAME A CHILDHOOD MARKED BY ABANDONMENT AND MISTREATMENT. AND SHE SOMEHOW MANAGED TO NOT BECOME BITTER OR BROKEN. MY MOTHER BELIEVED THAT LIFE IS ABOUT SERVING OTHERS. SHE TAUGHT ME NEVER TO BACK DOWN FROM A BULLY WHICH IT TURNS OUT WAS PRETTY GOOD ADVICE.   THIS PAST SATURDAY WOULD HAVE BEEN HER 97TH BIRTHDAY. BECAUSE SHE WAS BORN ON JUNE 4, 1919 AND SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT DATE. ON THE VERY DAY MY MOTHER WAS BORN, IN CHICAGO, CONGRESS WAS PASSING THE 19TH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.   THAT AMENDMENT FINALLY GAVE WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. I REALLY WISH MY MOTHER COULD BE HERE TONIGHT. I WISH SHE COULD SEE WHAT A WONDERFUL MOTHER CHELSEA HAS BECOME AND COULD MEET OUR BEAUTIFUL GRANDDAUGHTER CHARLOTTE. OF COURSE, I WISH SHE COULD SEE HER DAUGHTER BECOME THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S NOMINEE.   YET, THERE ARE STILL CEILINGS TO BREAK FOR WOMEN AND MEN FOR ALL OF US. BUT DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT GREAT THINGS CAN'T HAPPEN IN AMERICA. BARRIERS CAN COME DOWN. JUSTICE AND EQUALITY CAN WIN. OUR HISTORY HAS MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION SLOWLY AT TIMES BUT UNMISTAKABLY, THANKS TO GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS WHO REFUSED TO GIVE UP OR BACK DOWN. NOW YOU ARE WRITING A NEW CHAPTER OF THAT STORY. THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THERE ARE NO CEILINGS, NO LIMITS ON ANY OF US. THIS IS OUR MOMENT TO COME TOGETHER. SO PLEASE JOIN OUR CAMPAIGN, VOLUNTEER, GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM, CONTRIBUTE WHAT YOU CAN. HELP US ORGANIZE IN ALL 50 STATES. EVERY PHONE CALL YOU MAKE, EVERY DOOR YOU KNOCK ON, WILL MOVE US FORWARD. NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE A MOMENT LATER TONIGHT AND THE DAYS AHEAD TO FULLY ABSORB THE HISTORY WE'VE MADE HERE.   BUT WHAT I CARE ABOUT MOST IS THE HISTORY OUR COUNTRY HAS YET TO WRITE. OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN WILL LOOK BACK AT THIS TIME AT THE CHOICES WE ARE ABOUT TO MAKE. THE GOALS WE WILL STRIVE FOR, THE PRINCIPLES WE WILL LIVE BY. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN BE PROUD OF US. THE END OF THE PRIMARY IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF THE WORK WE'RE CALLED TO DO. BUT IF WE STAND TOGETHER, WE WILL RISE TOGETHER BECAUSE WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. LET'S GO OUT AND MAKE THAT CHANGE FOR AMERICA. THANK YOU, GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.                                  ",Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton Primary Night Speech

THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU.   I TELL YOU WHAT, IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN LONG BEACH.   AND TO BE INTRODUCED BY YOUR YOUNG, DYNAMIC MAYOR, MAYOR GARCIA. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE SENATE GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM FOR BEING HERE. STATE SENATOR KEVIN DALYELEON AND I WANT TO THANK THE ENTIRE COLLEGE TEAM LED BY RESIDENT OAKLEY. I WANT TO THANK MISTY PHILLIPS, ERIC BAUMAN AND SAMANTHA RONSON. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING WITH ME.   I HAVE TO TELL YOU, ACCORDING TO THE NEWS WE ARE IN THE BRINK OF A HISTORIC, HISTORIC, UNPRECEDENTED MOMENT, BUT WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO, DON'T WAIT? WE HAVE SIX ELECTIONS TOMORROW AND WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT HARD FOR EVERY SINGLE VOTE, ESPECIALLY RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA.   SO I AM ASKING EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU, HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE ALREADY VOTED BY MAIL? HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE A VALID AT HOME ON YOUR KITCHEN COUNTER? YOU COULD SEND IT IN TONIGHT OR EVEN BETTER, GO TO THE POLLS TOMORROW AND TAKE YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR FRIENDS.   YOU KNOW, I HAVE A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART FOR LONG BEACH.   SOME OF YOU REMEMBER THAT WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS PRESIDENT, HE WORKED CLOSELY WITH YOUR THEN MAYOR, MAYOR O'NEILL AND YOUR LEADERSHIP IN PALM BEACH. HE WAS -- LONG BEACH. HE WAS A GOOD PARTNER FOR LONG BEACH AS HE BEGAN MOVING INTO THE FUTURE, REVITALIZING LONG BEACH. WE ARE PROUD OF WHAT LONG BEACH HAS BECOME AT WANT TO BE A GOOD PARTNER FOR THE CITY.   I AM SO EXCITED BY ALL OF THE PROGRESS YOU HAVE MADE HERE AND I KNOW THAT WE CAN DO EVEN BETTER. I AM A PROGRESSIVE THAT LIKES TO GET THINGS DONE.   SO HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO GET DONE, MORE GOOD JOBS WITH RISING INCOMES.   MORE JOBS AND INFRASTRUCTURE, OUR ROADS, BRIDGES, TUNNELS, PORTS, AIRPORTS, WATER SYSTEMS. I WANT US TO BRING MANUFACTURING BACK AND IF WE MAKE IT HERE IN AMERICA, WE WILL PUT PEOPLE BACK TO WORK AND WE SHOULD BECAUSE WE OFTEN INVENTED, SO WHY HAVE IT MADE SOMEWHERE ELSE? WE CAN USE THAT GREAT PORT TO EXPORT AND IMPORT. WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE.   I HAVE A PLAN TO INSTALL HALF A BILLION MORE SOLAR PANELS BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM. ENOUGH CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME BY THE END OF MY SECOND TERM.   WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE LEADING NUMBER OF CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY JOBS BECAUSE SOME COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER AND I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE EITHER CHINA, GERMANY OR US AND I WANTED TO BE US, DON'T YOU?   IN ADDITION TO GROWING THE ECONOMY, WE WILL MAKE IT FAIRER. WE ARE GOING TO RAISE THE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE IT YOU HAVE DONE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE GOING TO DO MORE TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES THAT CREATE MOST OF THE NEW JOBS IN AMERICA AND WE ARE GOING TO FINALLY GUARANTEE EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN'S WORK.   AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THIS IS NOT A WOMAN'S ISSUE . IF YOU HAVE A MOTHER, A WIFE, A DAUGHTER OR A SISTER WHO IS WORKING, IT IS YOUR ISSUE, TOO.   WE ARE GOING TO GET FAMILY INCOMES UP AND THAT IS ONE OF THE FASTEST WAYS OF DOING IT. WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER, I AM REALLY EXCITED. I AM TIRED OF DONALD TRUMP. FOR MANY REASONS, BUT I AM TIRED OF HIM DOWN GRADY AMERICA. I AM TIRED OF HIM REALLY SPEAKING ILL OF OUR COUNTRY. I AM TIRED OF HIM TALKING ABOUT HOW WE ARE JUST A THIRD RATE COUNTRY. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT COUNTRY HE LIVES IN. THERE IS NO OTHER PLACE THAT AMERICA THAT HAS MORE PEOPLE WORKING HARDER RIGHT NOW.   SO LET'S GET REAL HERE FOR A MINUTE. WE HAVE WORK TO DO. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE. THERE IS NOTHING WE CANNOT DO IF WE MAKE UP OUR MINDS TO DO IT. I WANT US TO HAVE AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES A FIRST-CLASS EDUCATION TO EVERY CHILD NO MATTER WHAT ZIP CODE THAT CHILD LIVES IN.   I WANT TO WORK WITH OUR TEACHERS, EDUCATORS AND OUR OTHER SCHOOL STAFF TO GIVE OUR KIDS THE BEST POSSIBLE START . IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE HAVE TO BEGIN WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION, SO THAT WHEN THEY GET TO SCHOOL, KIDS ARE READY TO LEARN, AND WE ARE GOING TO FINALLY GET THE COST OF COLLEGE AFFORDABLE FOR FAMILIES.   I WANT TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BORROW A PENNY TO PAY FOR TUITION AT ANY FOUR-YEAR, PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY AND WE ARE GOING TO HELP YOU PAY DOWN YOUR DEBT AND PAY IT OFF SO YOU CAN GET OUT FROM UNDER THAT BURDEN.   I AM GOING TO DEFEND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BUT I WANT TO IMPROVE IT. WE ARE GOING TO GET THE COST DOWN, PREMIUMS, CO-PAYS, DEDUCTIBLES, PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS AND THEN THERE ARE TWO ISSUES I WANT TO TACKLE WITH YOUR HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION.   I HAVE MET TOO MANY PEOPLE TRAVELING THE COUNTRY OVER THIS PAST YEAR WHO HAVE TOLD ME THE STORIES OF THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES OR SOMEONE IN THEIR FAMILY OR A LOVED ONE. I HAVE HEARD TOO MANY PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS TALK ABOUT LOSING A YOUNGER PERSON TO ADDICTION, TO AN OVERDOSE. WE HAVE GOT TO CONFRONT THIS AND DEAL WITH IT, MORE SERVICES, MORE RESOURCES, MORE TREATMENT, MORE RECOVERY, PEOPLE DO NOT ALONG IN JAIL IF THEY HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEM.   NOW, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT MOST PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED WITH, IT COMES DOWN TO THEIR FAMILIES, THEIR LIVES, THEIR FUTURES. THAT IS WHY JOBS IS NUMBER ONE, EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE, BUT WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO BESIDES THAT. I AM GOING TO INTRODUCE IN MY VERY FIRST DAY AS PRESIDENT, COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP.   I AM GOING TO BUILD ON THE GOOD WORK PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DONE FOR WHICH HE DOES NOT GET ENOUGH CREDIT, BY THE WAY, FOR ALL HE HAS DONE ON THE ECONOMY AND HEALTH CARE. BUT IN PARTICULAR, I AM GOING TO BUILD ON THE WORK YOU STARTED WITH CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND ENDING OVER INCARCERATION. WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE MORE DIVERSE AND PROGRAMS, MORE SECOND CHANCE PROGRAMS. I AM ALSO GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN DO DEFEND A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN HEALTH CARE DECISIONS.   AND THAT INCLUDES, THAT INCLUDES DEFENDING, NOT DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD.   AND I WILL DEFEND MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND WORK AGAINST DISCRIMINATION.   WE ARE GOING TO DEFEND VOTERS RIGHTS AND I WILL APPOINT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES THAT WILL OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED.   I AM GOING TO DEFEND WORKERS RIGHTS AND THE RIGHTS TO ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY.   AND I AM GOING TO TAKE ON THE GUN LOBBY FOR COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY REFORM.    I TELL YOU, JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING I JUST SAID DONALD TRUMP DISAGREES WITH. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE QUITE AN ELECTION, AREN'T WE? I PERSONALLY CANNOT WAIT TO DEBATE HIM.   BUT YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU VOTE TOMORROW, YOU ARE NOT JUST VOTING FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT, YOU ARE VOTING FOR THE NEXT COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. I GAVE A SPEECH IN SAN DIEGO A FEW DAYS AGO THAT OUTLINESD ALL OF THE REASONS I BELIEVE HE IS NOT QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT AND HE IS TEMPERAMENTALLY UNFIT TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.   I HAVE TO CONFESS, WHEN I WAS PREPARING THAT SPEECH AND GOING THROUGH IT, EVEN I WAS THINKING, HE REALLY SAID THAT? BUT IN FACT, HE DID. HE ATTACKED OUR CLOSEST ALLIES, HAS PRAISED DICTATORS, SAID WE SHOULD PULL OUT OF NATO, THE PREMIER DEFENSE ALLIANCE. HE HAS CASUALLY SUGGESTED HE DOES NOT CARE IF OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING SAUDI ARABIA GET NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HE HAS ADVOCATED A RETURN TO TORTURE. HE SAID HE WOULD ORDER OUR MILITARY TO KILL THE FAMILIES OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS, WHICH IS AN INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIME. NOW, I KNOW FOREIGN POLICY IS NOT ALWAYS A BIG ISSUE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, BUT HERE IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND. JUST IGNORE THAT, WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND IS THIS.   HERE IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND. WHEN YOU ARE IN THE SITUATION ROOM IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THE HARD DECISIONS ARE THE ONES THAT GET TO BE PRESIDENT. IF THEY ARE NOT HARD, SOMEONE ELSE DECIDES IT ALONG THE WAY, AND WHEN WE HAD INTELLIGENCE THAT WE PERHAPS KNEW WHERE BIN LADEN WAS, I WAS PART OF A SMALL GROUP TO ANALYZE THAT INTELLIGENCE AND TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO BE PRESIDENT. IT WAS PERSONAL TO ME BECAUSE I WAS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK ON 9/11 SO I WAS THERE AT GROUND ZERO, 24 HOURS AFTER WE WERE ATTACKED AND I SAID THAT I WOULD DO WHATEVER I COULD TO BRING BIN LADEN TO JUSTICE FOR THE MURDER OF 3000 INNOCENT PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY.   SO WE WENT OVER ALL OF THE INTELLIGENCE AND FINALLY THE PRESIDENT SAID, AFTER DAYS OF THIS, THAT HE WANTED EACH OF US TO GO AROUND THE TABLE AND GET A RECOMMENDATION. THE PEOPLE OF THAT TABLE WERE EXPERIENCED, EXPERTS AND EVERYBODY ARE RESPECTED, BUT EACH PERSON HAD A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TAKE. SOME PEOPLE SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, THE INTELLIGENCE IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH AND WE SHOULD NOT ASK. OTHERS SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS STRONG ENOUGH FOR A MISSILE ATTACK BUT NOT TO SEND IN SPECIAL FORCES. AND A THIRD OPTION WAS, IT IS STRONG ENOUGH AND WE HAVE TO SEND IN SPECIAL FORCES BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE WILL NEVER KNOW WHETHER OR NOT WE GOT HIM. I WAS IN THAT THIRD CATEGORY AND I RECOMMENDED THAT TO THE PRESIDENT, BUT HERE IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND. THE PRESIDENT MAKES THE DECISION. WHEN HE SAID, HE WAS GOING TO RETIRE, TAKE ALL OF HIS NOTES WITH HIM TO GO OFF AND DELIBERATE, IT WAS HIS DECISION. HE CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY AND SAID HE WAS GOING TO ORDER THE SEAL TEAM. IT WAS AS CRISP AND COURAGEOUS A DECISION I HAVE SEEN BECAUSE IT WAS A RISKY ONE. WHEN THE DAY CAME AND WE WILL ALL -- WE WERE ALL CROWDED IN THE SITUATION ROOM WATCHING WHAT WE COULD SEE ON THE MONITORS, SOMETHING HAPPENED. THOSE OF YOU THE SAW THE MOVIE, MAYBE YOU READ ABOUT IT, ONE OF THE HELICOPTERS CLIPPED IT'SS TAIL WHICH MEANT IT WAS DISABLED. AFTER THE SEAL TEAM FOUGHT THEIR WAY AND, KILL THE BODYGUARDS, BIN LADEN'S SON AND HIM, THEY KNEW THEY WOULD HAVE TO BLOW UP THE HELICOPTER BECAUSE WE COULD AFFORD TO LEAVE IT WITH ALL OF THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY THERE. SECONDS WERE PASSING BY. PEOPLE WERE WAKING UP AROUND THERE. THIS IS A MILITARY BASE IN TOWN EQUIVALENT TO WHERE OUR WEST POINT IS. EVERY SECOND COUNTED, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE SEALS TO? THEY TOOK ALL OF THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN TO SAFETY. THEY LED THEM OUT OF THE COMPOUND BEFORE THEY BLEW UP THAT HELICOPTER.   THAT IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT UNDERSTAND. THAT IS HONOR. THAT IS A REPRESENTATION OF THE VALUES OF THE AMERICAN MILITARY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND OUR COUNTRY.   SO THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE NOTCHES FOR AMERICA THAT FOR THE WORLD. THE FINAL POINT I WOULD ASK YOU TO CONSIDER IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO UNIFY OUR COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, ABRAHAM LINCOLN SAID, THE HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF CANNOT STAND AND LIKE SO MANY THINGS, HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT. WHAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IS BEGIN ACTUALLY LISTENING TO EACH OTHER AND RESPECTING EACH OTHER.   UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, I DO NOT THINK I HAVE ALL OF THE ANSWERS. IF YOU WANT TO VOTE FOR SOMEBODY WHO THINKS THEY HAVE ALL OF THE ANSWERS, WELL, YOU HAVE DONALD. WHEN ASKED WHO HIS ADVISERS WERE ON FOREIGN POLICY HE SAID, WELL, I LISTEN TO MYSELF BECAUSE I HAVE A VERY GOOD BRAIN.   ALSO MY OTHER FAVORITE, I CANNOT LET IT GO. HE WAS ASKED ABOUT HIS FOREIGN-POLICY EXPERIENCE AND HE SAID, WELL, I TOOK A MISS UNIVERSE CONTEST TO MOSCOW.   MY POINT IS THIS, WE HAVE TO LISTEN AND LEARN FROM EACH OTHER. NO ONE PERSON HAS ALL OF THE ANSWERS. THAT IS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A CONVERSATION IN AMERICA ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO GET THINGS DONE, MOVE IT FORWARD, LIFT US UP. WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. I WILL GO ANYWHERE ANY TIME TO SEEK COMMON GROUND. I WILL TALK TO ANYBODY. I DID AS FIRST LADY, AS A SENATOR, AS SECRETARY OF STATE AND I WILL CERTAINLY DO THAT AS PRESIDENT.   BUT I CANNOT DO ANY OF THIS WITHOUT YOUR HELP. I NEED YOU TO TURN OUT TOMORROW. GET EVERYBODY YOU CAN TO GO VOTE TOMORROW. MAKE A VERY CLEAR STATEMENT. WE ARE REPUDIATING DONALD TRUMP AND GETTING READY FOR THE FALL ELECTION. WE ARE GOING TO DEFEAT HIM IF YOU WILL VOTE FOR ME, I WILL WORK FOR YOU, I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU AND TOGETHER WE WILL CREATE THE FUTURE AMERICA DESERVES. GOD BLESS YOU ALL.

THANK YOU. HAD, OHIO! WHAT A CROWD. THANK YOU. IT IS -- THANK YOU! [CHEERS  THANK YOU WILL STOP IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE  WITH SO MANY FRIENDS. AND LEADERS LIKE GOVERNOR TED STRICKLAND, THE NEXT SENATOR FROM OHIO F ALL GOES WELL AND MY  FRIEND AND FORMER COLLEAGUE  SENATOR SHERROD BROWN, THERE IS  NO GREATER FIGHTER FOR OHIO OR  JOBS OR FAIRNESS! CONGRESSWOMAN JOYCE BEATTY,  THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE IN  YOUR DISTRICT. CONGRESSWOMAN MARCIA, MY FRIEND FROM CLEVELAND, MARCIE, A GREAT  FIGHTER FOR OHIO.  CONGRESSMAN TIM RYAN. THE HONORABLE BETTY SUTTON. THANK YOU FOR CHAIRING THE OHIO  DEMOCRATIC HARDY. THANK YOU TO THE COUNTY  EXECUTIVE. THANK YOU TO THE MAYOR OF  CINCINNATI. THANK YOU TO THE MAYOR OF  TOLEDO. IT IS WONDERFUL STANDING UP HERE  LOOKING AT THIS GREAT ARRAY OF DEMOCRATS. EARLIER, JOYCE BEATTY AND I VISITED TWO OTHER GREAT  DEMOCRATS. JOHN AND ANDY WHO SEND YOU THERE WERE MOST GREETINGS.   AND TO ALL THE  STATE AND LOCAL LEADERS WHO ARE  POURING THEIR HEARTS INTO BUILDING THE DEMOCRATIC HARDY  ACROSS THE STATE, I THANK YOU. BECAUSE WE NEED TO ELECT  DEMOCRATS UP AND DOWN THE TICKET IN NOVEMBER.  SENATOR CLINTON L -- SECRETARY  IF I AM LUCKY ENOUGH TO  BE THE NOMINEE, I WILL BE YOUR  PARTNER. WE WILL WORK HARD EVERY DAY TO  KEEP THE OHIO DEMOCRATIC ALREADY STRONG AND TO BRING BACK STATE PARTIES ACROSS AMERICA BECAUSE TOGETHER WE NEED TO BUILD A FUTURE WHERE EVERY AMERICAN HAS THE CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL.  NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM,  WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE, OR WHO YOU LOVE!   SECRETARY CLINTON AND THE STAKES  IN THIS ELECTION KEEP GETTING HIGHER. WHILE THE RHETORIC KEEPS SINKING  LOWER. IN A DEMOCRACY LIKE OURS, OF  COURSE WE GOING TO HAVE  DIFFERENCES. BUT WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM DONALD TRUMP IS SOMETHING ELSE  ENTIRELY. LET US JUST TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT  WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. DONALD TRUMP IS RUNNING A  CYNICAL CAMPAIGN OF HATE AND  FEAR FOR ONE REASON. TO GET VOTES.  HE IS ENCOURAGING VIOLENCE AND  CHAOS TO GET VOTES.  HE IS HITTING -- PAINTING AMERICANS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO  GET VOTES.  DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE WANTS TO  ROUND UP MILLIONS OF LATINO IMMIGRANTS AND KICK THEM OUT OF  THE UNITED STATES. A NATION BUILT BY IMMIGRANTS. HE WANTS TO BAN ALL MUSLIMS FROM  THE UNITED STATES.  A COUNTRY FOUNDED ON RELIGIOUS  FREEDOM. HE SUPPORTS TORTURE. ADVOCATES KILLING THE WIVES AND  CHILDREN OF OUR ENEMIES. AND HAVE TO BE TOLD THAT THESE ARE WAR CRIMES IN VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.  OUR OWN LAWS, OUR MOST DEEPLY HELD AND SUPPOSE IN OUR  CONSTITUTION. IT IS, AFTER STOKING EVERY FIRE  HE CAN THINK OF, TRUMP  ENCOURAGES HIS SUPPORTERS TO BEAT UP ANYBODY DISAGREE WITH  THEM. LITERALLY PUNCH THEM IN THE CASE WILL STOP AND THEN OFFERS TO PAY  THEIR LEGAL BILLS. NOW, OUR BEST, AMERICANS HAVE  READ JUST DID DEMAGOGUES AND  FEAR MONGERS.  YOU DO NOT MAKE AMERICA GREAT BY GETTING RID OF EVERYTHING THAT  MADE AMERICA GREAT IN THE FIRST  PLACE WILL STOP   YOU A I KNOW DONALD TRUMP IS NOT WE ARE. OF COURSE, WE CAN CRITICIZE AND PROTEST MR. TRUMP ALL WE WANT. THAT NONE OF THAT MATTERS IF WE DO NOT ALSO SHOW UP AT THE  POLLS. [APPLAUSE WAS BRACKET  IF YOU WANT TO SHUT THEM DOWN, THEN LET'S VOTE HIM DOWN. AND LET US RAISE UP A BETTER  FUTURE FOR OURSELVES AND OUR  CHILDREN. MY CAMPAIGN IS NOT ABOUT HOLDING WALLS, IT IS ABOUT BREAKING DOWN ALL THE BARRIERS HOLDING PEOPLE AND BUILDING LADDERS OF OPPORTUNITY AND AND EMPOWERMENT. IT IS ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE FIND GOOD JOBS THAT PAID FOR THEIR FAMILIES TO LIVE ON AND REBUILD  THE MIDDLE-CLASS. A GOOD JOB IT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON  AND NOT. REPLACING OUTGROWN CLOTHING AND  WORN OUT SHOES. KEEPING YOUR HOME OR NOT.  IT IS ALSO ABOUT THE AND PRIDE, KNOWING THAT YOU ARE DOING YOUR  PART AND GETTING REALLY WORDED OR YOUR HARDWARE. MOST OF ALL A GOOD JOB IS ABOUT  TAKING CARE OF THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE.  WE ALL WANT OUR CHILDREN TO HAVE  BETTER LIVES THAN WE DID BUT  WITHOUT A BETTER JOB, GIVING  YOUR KIDS GOOD CHOICES AND  OPPORTUNITIES TO GET IT IS A LOT HARDER. IF YOU ARE DOING THE SAME JOBS  YOUR PARENTS DID BUT FOR LESS  MONEY AND FEWER BENEFITS, IF YOU  ARE GOING TO EVERY JOB FAIR,  SENDING OUT RESUMES, AND GETTING RETRAINED ITS TILL CANNOT FIND A  JOB THAT PAYS ENOUGH TO RAISE A  FAMILY, IF YOU SAW YOUR PARENTS  MAKE THAT GOOD LIVING, WORKING HARD, WORKING SO HARD EVERY DAY  AND TO NOW YOU'LL CAN ONLY DREAM  OF SUCH A LIFE FOR YOURSELF IT  IS NO WONDER MANY AMERICANS ARE  CONCERNED, FRUSTRATED, EVEN  ANGRY. THAT IS WHY THE TASK OF THIS  ELECTION HAS TO BE WHETHER WE  CAN ACTUALLY CREATE GOOD PAYING  JOBS HERE IN AMERICA. HE KISSED THE GOOD JOBS OF THE FUTURE ARE EITHER GOING TO END  UP IN ASIA OR EUROPE OR HERE. AND I TELL YOU, WE NOT ONLY WANT THEM, WE WILL MAKE SURE THEY AND  UP RIGHT HERE IN OHIO AND THE  REST OF OUR COUNTRY.   ANYONE WHO ONCE TO DO THAT HAS TO HAVE A  CREDIBLE STRATEGY DESIGNED FOR  THE WORLD WOULD LIVE IN NOW. -- THE WORLD WE LIVE IN NOW.  I AM GREAT BOWL THAT LEADERS LIKE SHERROD BROWN HAVE LOOKED AT MY PLANS AND SAID, THIS IS THE KIND OF MANUFACTURING PLANT WE NEED. THAT IS WHAT I AM GOING TO BE  WORKING FOR. AND OVER THE PAST WEEK OR SO WE HAVE HAD SOME GREAT ARGUMENTS AND DEBATES IN OUR CAMPAIGN AND  I APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN SENATOR SANDERS AND I  DEBATING AND DISAGREEING ABOUT  ISSUES IS THAT WE ARE BOTH  PRESENTING IDEAS. THE OTHER SIDE IS PRESENTING INSULTS ARE THAT TAKE US  NOWHERE. THIS CAMPAIGN HAS TO BE ABOUT  THE FUTURE, NOT THE PAST. AND LOOK, I WANT TO BE VERY  CLEAR. I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF  DISCUSSION IN THE LAST WEEK OR  SO ABOUT TRADE. AND, I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE  OPPORTUNITY TONIGHT TO SET THE  RECORD STRAIGHT. TO EVERY WORKER IN OHIO AND  EVERY WORKER ACROSS AMERICA, LET  ME STATE THIS. IF I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL STAND WITH YOU AND I WILL HAVE YOUR BACK AND I WILL STOP DEAD IN ITS TRACK ANY TRADE DEAL THAT HURTS AMERICA AND AMERICAN WORKERS.   NOW, I OPPOSE  THE ONLY MULTILATERAL TRADE DEAL  THAT CAME UP WHEN I WAS IN THE  SENATE. I THOUGHT IT WAS BAD FOR  AMERICAN JOBS. I FOUGHT FOR AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS AGAINST CHINA  CHEATING. AND, WHEN IT COMES IN THE TRANSFER -- THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP, I WAITED TO SEE WHAT WAS ACTUALLY IN IT AND THEN I PROPOSE TO BECAUSE I CONCLUDED I COULD NOT LOOK AMERICAN  WORKERS IN THE EYE AND SAY THIS  DEAL WOULD RAISE WAGES.  THAT IS WHY I SAID WE HAVE TO OPPOSE THE TPP. NOW, I RESPECT THOSE WHO OPPOSE ALL TRADE AGREEMENTS.  EVERY SINGLE ONE.  I RESPECT THAT. THAT IS AN OPINION AND IT IS  CERTAINLY ONE THAT PEOPLE HAVE EVERY REASON TO HOLD. BUT, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, TRADE,  WHEN IT IS DONE RIGHT, CAN HELP THOUSANDS OF OHIO COMPANIES THAT  ARE RIGHT NOW EXPORTING ALIENS  OF DOLLARS WORTH OF PRODUCTS AND CREATING GOOD PAYING AMERICAN  JOBS IN THE PROCESS. AFTER ALL, WE ARE NOT EVEN 5% OF  THE WORLDS POPULATION. SO, IF WE WANT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY TO GROW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SELL TO THE  OTHER 95%. SO, WHILE WE CANNOT SHUT OUR  BORDERS TO TRADE, WE CAN, AND I  WILL DEMAND, THAT WE HAVE FAIR  TRADE AND AS LEVEL A PLAYING  FIELD AS WE CAN CREATE.   YOU SEE, I  THINK WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS NOT JUST OPPOSED TO TRADE, WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS HOW  TO COMPETE AGAINST THE REST OF  THE WORLD AND WIN. WHEN FOR AMERICA AND WIN FOR AMERICANS. RIGHT NOW, THE MOST URGENT TRADE  ISSUES WE HAVE ARE WITH CHINA. THE BIGGEST ROLE-BREAKER OUT  THERE.  AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,  MY FRIENDS, I KNOW A THING OR  TWO ABOUT GOING TILL-2-2 WITH THE CHINESE. I DID IT AS SENATOR, I DID IT AS  SECRETARY OF STATE, AND I WILL  DO IT AS PRESIDENT.  WE NEED TO STOP CHINA -- WE NEED  TO STOP CHINA FROM DUMPING CHEAP  STEEL.  THAT IS NOT A NEW OPINION FOR  ME.  WHEN I WAS A CENTER I WENT IN FRONT OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF  STEELWORKERS IN NEW YORK BECAUSE  I COULD SEE THAT BOTH THE  COMPANIES IN THE STEELWORKERS  WERE PAYING A BIG PRICE. AND, WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN TRADE RULES TO PREVENT BLATANTLY UNFAIR PRACTICES LIKE WEAK RULES  OF ORIGIN THAT PUT OUR CARMAKERS  AT AN UNFAIR DISADVANTAGE. AND, I HAVE ALSO PROPOSED A TRADE PROSECUTOR AND, AS SHARED SAID -- AS SHERROD BROWN SAID, ENOUGH INVESTIGATORS SO WE WILL BE ON THIS IMMEDIATELY AND IT WILL NOT BE UP TO COMPANIES AND  UNIONS AND WORKERS TO BRING TRADE COMPLAINTS. UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SHOULD  BE LEADING THE WAY TO PROTECT  AGAINST UNFAIR TREATMENT!   WE ALSO HAVE  TO TAKE STRONGER ACTION AGAINST  COMPANIES THAT ARE SHUTTING DOWN  AMERICAN JOBS AND SENDING THEM  OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. WE NEED TO GET RESULTS WILL WE  TALK ABOUT THIS.  HERE'S WHAT I WILL DO.  IF COMPANIES SHIP ROBS OVERSEAS,  WE WILL MAKE THEM GET BACK THE  TAX BREAKS THEY HAVE RECEIVED IN  AMERICA THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN FROM CITY, STATE, AND FEDERAL TAXPAYERS AND OF COMPANIES TRY  TO MOVE THEIR HEADQUARTERS TO A  FOREIGN COUNTRY AND SKIP OUT ON  THEIR TAX BILL, WE'RE GOING TO  SLAP A NEW EXIT TAX ON THEM. MAKE THEM THINK TWICE BEFORE  THEY PRETEND TO MOVE THEIR  HEADQUARTERS TO AVOID SHARING -- PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. WE'LL TAKE THAT MONEY AND PUT IT  TO WORK IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT  ARE BEING HURT. WE WILL STAND UP FOR AMERICAN WORKERS AND MAKE SURE NO ONE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US.  NOT CHINA, NOT WALL STREET, NOT  OVERPAID CORPORATE EXECUTIVES.  BUT WE CANNOT STOP THERE. I HAVE LAID OUT A NATIONAL  STRATEGY TO CREATE GOOD PAYING  MANUFACTURING JOBS. AND, I THINK THAT IS THE MOST  IMPORTANT WAY TO JUDGE WHAT  SOMEONE WILL DO FOR MANUFACTURING. I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE WITH A  CANDIDATE -- WITH A PLAN TO  CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING  JOBS. JOBS AND INFRASTRUCTURE,  MANUFACTURING, CLEAN ENERGY,  SMALL BUSINESS. WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN  DO, I KNOW THAT WE CAN HAVE A  RENAISSANCE IN MANUFACTURING. I KNOW WE HAVE GOT MORE WORK THAN WE CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE REPAIRING INFRASTRUCTURE. SO, I AM GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO SAVE AND CREATE JOBS.  AND, BY THE WAY, YOU HEARD SHERROD BROWN MENTION THE AUTO  INDUSTRY.  NOW, LOOK. THERE HAS BEEN DEBATE BACK AND  FORTH ON THAT. OR IS NO DOUBT WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME INTO OFFICE WE WERE  IN THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. THE AUTO INDUSTRY TEETERED ON  THE BRINK OF A GROEP SEE.  AND, YOU REMEMBER THE  REPUBLICANS ALL SAID, LET IT GO. RIGHT? THEY DID NOT WANT TO LIFT A  FINGER EVEN TO HELP WORKERS AND  THEIR OWN STATE. SO, WHAT WERE WE TO DO?  I WAS STILL IN THE SENATE. IN DECEMBER, BOTH SENATOR  SANDERS AND I VOTED TO RESCUE  THE AUTO INDUSTRY. BUT IT FAILED.  WE COULD NOT GET THE REPUBLICANS  TO SUPPORT IT. ONE MONTH LATER, WE FACED ONE OF  THOSE HARD CHOICES THAT FORCE  YOU TO GOVERN IN A REALITY. AND, IT WAS THIS. THERE WAS A BILL THAT MIXED MONEY FOR THE AUTO RESCUE AND  MONEY FOR OTHER REAL ELSE. -- OTHER REAL ELSE. -- OTHER BAIL OUTS. I RESPECT THOSE WHO VOTED AGAINST IT, BUT I VOTED FOR IT. RESIDENT ELECT OBAMA ASKED US TO  VOTE FOR.  I DECIDED IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT  TO SAVE THE AUTO INDUSTRY BEEN OUR ECONOMY. THEY JUST HAD THE BEST YEAR THEY  HAD IN DECADES. FACTORIES, OHIO, SUPPLY COMPANIES ARE DOING SO WELL. SO, MY FRIENDS, AMERICA IS A BIG, COMPLICATED COUNTRY FACING  BIG, COMPLICATED CHALLENGES. WE CANNOT AFFORD A SINGLE ISSUE  STRATEGY FOR A SINGLE ISSUE  PRESIDENT. KNOCKING DOWN BARRIERS, THAT MEANS WE CANNOT JUST TALK ABOUT ECONOMIC INEQUALITY.  WE ALSO HAVE TO TAKE ON RACIAL INEQUALITY. WE HAVE TO FACE UP TO THE REALITY OF SYSTEMIC RACISM. YOU KNOW WHAT IS REAL. AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES FACE DISCRIMINATION. THEY HAVE JUST A FRACTION OF THE  ASSETS AND WEALTH OF WHITE  FAMILIES.  AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES SUFFER GREAT AND IS PERSONALLY.  TOO MANY YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN  PEOPLE DIE AFTER ENCOUNTERS WITH  POLICE. LIKE TAMIR RICE AT 12-YEARS-OLD  SHOT AND KILLED WHILE PLAYING IN  A PARK.  WE HAVE TO PUT AN END TO THE FEARS OF IMMIGRANT FAMILIES WHO ARE LAYING AWAKE AT NIGHT  LISTENING FOR A KNOCK ON THE  DOOR, EVEN AFTER THEY HAVE LIVED  AND WORKED HERE FOR YEARS.  WE HAVE TO STAND UP FOR UNIONS  AND LABOR RIGHTS.   AND I HAVE TO  THANK YOU, OHIO DEMOCRATS,  BECAUSE WHEN THE CHIPS WERE DOWN  AT YOU DID NOT LET GOVERNOR KASICH DROWN OUT THE VOICES OF OHIO'S PUBLIC SERVANTS BY WEAKENING THEIR UNION.   NOW, LET US STAND  UP FOR ALL UNIONS NATIONWIDE  BECAUSE WHEN UNIONS ARE STRONG  FAMILIES ARE STRONG. THE MIDDLE CLASS IS STRONG. AND, AMERICA IS STRONG.   AND DO NOT FORGET,  SUPREME COURT APPOINTMENTS WILL  HELP DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENS TO  SO MANY ISSUES. WE CANNOT LET AMERICA HAVE A  REPUBLICAN CONGRESS. A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT. AND, A REPUBLICAN SUPREME COURT. KNOCKING DOWN BARRIERS MEANS MAKING SURE ALL OF OUR CHILDREN GET THE EDUCATION THEY NEED TO  SUCCEED IN THE 21ST CENTURY ECONOMY. I BELIEVE OUR SCHOOLS DESERVE MORE TLC. TEACHING, LEARNING, AND  COMMUNITY. AND, I HAVE LAID OUT A PLAN SO  ALL CHILDREN GET BENEFITS AND PUT GOOD TEACHERS AND GOOD  SCHOOLS NO MATTER WHAT ZIP CODE  THEY HAPPEN TO LIVE IN. KNOCKING DOWN BARRIERS MEANS FINALLY GUARANTEEING PAID FAMILY  LEAVE AND EQUAL PAY OR WOMEN. -- EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN. IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR OHIO WHEN JOHN KASICH DEFUNDED PLANNED  TERROR TIED HERE. AND, MAKE NO MISTAKE, IF A REPUBLICAN WINS THE WHITE HOUSE  WE WILL SEE THAT HAPPENED  NATIONWIDE. I HAVE SPENT MY CAREER FIGHTING  TO EVEN THE ODDS FOR PEOPLE WHO  HAD THOSE ODDS STACKED AGAINST  THEM. I AM NOT OFFERING PROMISES WE  CAN'T KEEP.  WE ALL NEED TO DO OUR PART, ALL  OF US, TO BUILD THE KIND OF  FUTURE WE ARE FIGHTING FOR.  TO GIVE EVERY AMERICAN THE  CHANCE TO PURSUE HIS OR HER  DREAMS. BECAUSE THEN A HAND ONLY THEN CAN AMERICA LIVE UP TO ITS  POTENTIAL, TOO. NOW, IF YOU NEED A LITTLE  INSPIRATION LET ME SHARE  SOMETHING THAT INSPIRED ME. I WANT YOU TO HEAR ABOUT A YOUNG  WOMAN FROM WORTHINGTON, OHIO. A FEW WEEKS AGO, SHE WROTE TO  TELL ME HOW EXCITED ALL FOUR  GENERATIONS OF THE WOMEN IN HER  FAMILY ARE ABOUT THE PRIMARY ON  TUESDAY. GREAT GRANDMOTHER M,O MOSSY BOAT , IS 94.  SHE DEDICATED HER LIFE TO THE  UNITED STATES ARMY. SHE BELIEVES OUR COUNTRY NEEDS A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF THAT CAN  LEAD.  THE GRANDMOTHER WAS ABLE TO GET  HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE OF THE  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. SHE BELIEVES WE NEED TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE UNDER  PRESIDENT OBAMA AND NOT LET IT GET RIPPED AWAY. SARAH HERSELF HAS TWO LITTLE  CHILDREN. SHE BELIEVES WE NEED TO END THE  EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE AND  KEEP OUR FAMILIES SAFE.   AND THEN THERE IS  THE LITTLE GIRL, WHO JUST  STARTED PRESCHOOL.  SHE IS THE ULTIMATE REASON TO  VOTE. SARAH SAYS OUR HOPE FOR THE NATION IS A COUNTRY THAT CAN REWARD LOVE AND KINDNESS AND  SOON OF HATE.  YOU CAN REACH OUT AND HELP  OTHERS OVER HERE.  THAT OUR KIDS CAN GROW UP UNDERSTANDING THAT NOT ONLY ARE ALL THINGS POSSIBLE BUT THAT IT IS OUR JOB AND RESPONSIBILITY TO  TAKE THESE POSSIBILITIES AND  MAKE THEM AND REALITY. I CANNOT THINK OF A BETTER WAY  OF EXPLAINING WHAT WE STAND FOR  IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. MOSSY, GRETEL, AND SARAH ARE  HERE WITH US TONIGHT.  I HAD A CHANCE TO MEET THEM.  THEY ARE WHO WE ARE VOTING FOR. THEIR FAMILY AND MILLIONS OF  FAMILIES THAT NEVER STOPPED WORKING.  WHO ARE ALWAYS LOOKING TO MAKE  LIFE BETTER FOR THEIR KIDS AND  THEMSELVES. TO MAKE THAT THE REALITY.  I KNOW THAT IF WE ARE DETERMINED  AND COMMITTED, IF WE ARE CONFIDENT AND OPTIMISTIC, WE CAN  DELIVER ON THOSE POSSIBILITIES.  I WANT TO BE A PRESIDENT WHO  GETS UP EVERY SINGLE DAY IN  THINKS ABOUT WHAT I CAN DO TO  HELP THE STRUGGLING AND STRIVING  AMERICAN. WHAT I CAN DO TO HELP OUR  CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. WHAT I CAN DO TO MAKE IT  ABSOLUTELY CLEAR WE ARE GOING TO PRODUCE MORE GOOD JOBS WITH  RISING INCOMES. AND, WE ARE TO BE WHO WE SHOULD  BE. CONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES. WE ARE GOING TO REJECT HATRED  AND FEAR. WE ARE GOING TO DECIDE THAT WE  CAN DO BETTER TO GET THERE. THAT IS MY HOPE FOR OUR COUNTRY. I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN ME IN THAT. I HOPE YOU WILL BE THERE WITH  ME. I HOPE I CAN EARN YOUR VOTE ON THE PRIMARY -- IN THE PRIMARY ON TUESDAY.  I HOPE I WILL BE YOUR DEMOCRATIC  NOMINEE. I HOPE WE WILL FIGHT AGAINST  WHATEVER THE REPUBLICANS PUT AN  HOUR AWAY AND I HOPE WE WILL WIN  TO CONTINUE THE PROGRESS TO WIN THE FUTURE AND MOVE WITH THE HOPE, OPTIMISM, AND CONFIDENCE,  THAT AMERICA'S BEST DAYS ARE'S  DEALT AHEAD OF US. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.   [CHANTING",Ohio Democratic Party Legacy Dinner

THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, SAN DIEGO, FOR THAT  WARM, WARM WELCOME. AND THANKS TO ELLEN FOR  THOSE MOVING WORDS. AND FOR REMINDING US THAT IT IS  NOT ONLY OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN  UNIFORM THAT SERVE OUR FAMILIES. -- THAT SERVE OUR COUNTRY, IT IS  THEIR FAMILIES. I WANT TO THANK CONGRESSMAN SCOTT PETERS FOR BEING HERE. AND ALL OF THE OTHER ELECTEDS  AND SERVICE MEMBERS, ACTIVE-DUTY AND RETIRED. NATIONAL GUARD, RESERVISTS,  VETERANS, MILITARY SPOUSES, FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE ALL WITH  US TODAY. ON MONDAY, WE OBSERVED MEMORIAL DAY. A DAY THAT MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO  SAN DIEGO. HOME OF SO MANY ACTIVE-DUTY AND  FORMER MILITARY AND THEIR  FAMILIES. WE HONOR THE SACRIFICE OF THOSE THAT DIED FOR OUR COUNTRY IN  MANY WAYS. BY LIVING OUR VALUES. BY MAKING THIS A STRONG AND FAIR  NATION. AND BY CARRYING OUT A STRONG AND  PRINCIPLED FOREIGN POLICY. THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO SPEAK  ABOUT TODAY. THE CHALLENGES WE FACE  PROTECTING OUR COUNTRY AND THE CHOICE AT STAKE IN THIS  ELECTION. IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN A FEARFUL  AMERICA THAT IS LESS SECURE AND LESS ENGAGED WITH THE WORLD. AND A STRONG, CONFIDENT AMERICA THAT LEADS TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE AND OUR ECONOMY GROWING. AS SECRETARY OF STATE, SENATOR,  AND FIRST LADY, I HAD THE HONOR  OF REPRESENTING AMERICA ABROAD  AND HELPING SHAPE OUR FOREIGN  POLICY AT HOME. AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT,  THERE IS NOTHING I TAKE MORE SERIOUSLY THAN NATIONAL  SECURITY. I HAVE OFFERED CLEAR STRATEGIES  ON HOW TO DEFEAT ISIS, STRENGTHEN ALLIANCES, AND MAKE  SURE IRAN NEVER GETS A NUCLEAR  WEAPON. AND I AM GOING TO KEEP AMERICA'S SECURITY AT THE HEART OF MY  CAMPAIGN. BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW SO WELL,  AMERICANS ARE NOT JUST ELECTING A PRESIDENT IN NOVEMBER. WE ARE CHOOSING OUR NEXT  COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF TO DECIDE  QUESTIONS OF WAR AND PEACE,  LIFE, AND DEATH. I BELIEVE THE PERSON THE  REPUBLICANS HAVE NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT CANNOT DO THE JOB. DONALD TRUMP'S IDEAS ARE NOT  JUST DIFFERENT. THEY ARE DANGEROUSLY INCOHERENT. THEY ARE NOT EVEN REALLY IDEAS. JUST A SERIES OF BIZARRE RANTS,  PERSONAL FEUDS, AND OUTRIGHT  LIES. HE IS NOT JUST UNPREPARED. HE IS TEMPERAMENTALLY UNFIT TO  HOLD AN OFFICE THAT REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE, STABILITY, AND MN'S  RESPONSIBILITY. THIS IS NOT SOMEONE WHO SHOULD  EVER HAVE THE NEW YEAR CODES  BECAUSE IT IS NOT HARD TO  IMAGINE DONALD TRUMP LEADING US  INTO WAR BECAUSE SOMEONE GOT  UNDER HIS VERY THIN SKIN. WE CANNOT PUT THE SECURITY OF OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN IN DONALD TRUMP'S HANDS. WE CANNOT LET THEM ROLL THE DICE  WITH AMERICA. THIS IS A MAN THAT SAID MORE COUNTRIES SHOULD HAVE NUCLEAR  WEAPONS, INCLUDING SAUDI ARABIA.  THIS IS SOMEONE WHO HAS THREATENED TO ABANDONED OUR ALLIES IN NATO, THE COUNTRIES  THAT WORK WITH US TO ROOT OUT TERRORISTS ABROAD BEFORE THEY STRIKE US AT HOME. HE BELIEVES WE CAN TREAT THE  U.S. ECONOMY LIKE ONE OF HIS NOSE AND DEFAULT ON OUR DEBTS TO  THE REST OF THE WORLD WHICH  WOULD CAUSE AN ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE FAR WORSE THAN  ANYTHING WE EXPERIENCED IN 2008. HE HAS SAID THAT HE WOULD ORDER  OUR MILITARY TO CARRY OUT TORTURE AND THE MURDER OF  CIVILIANS WHO ARE RELATED TO  SUSPECTED TERRORISTS EVEN THOUGH  THOSE ARE WAR CRIMES. HE SAYS HE DOESN'T HAVE TO  LISTEN TO GENERALS OR ADMIRALS,  AMBASSADORS AND OTHER OFFICIALS  BECAUSE HE HAS ""A VERY GOOD BRAIN."" HE ALSO SAID I KNOW MORE ABOUT  ISIS THEN THE GENERALS DO. BELIEVE ME.  IT YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T BELIEVE HIM.  HE SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX INVENTED BY THE CHINESE AND SAID  IT OF WAR LIKE JOHN MCCAIN ARE  NOT HEROES.  EXACTLY. HE PRAISES DICTATORS WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN AND PICK FIGHTS WITH OUR FRIENDS INCLUDING THE  BRITISH PRIME MINISTER, THE  MAYOR OF LONDON, THE GERMAN  CHANCELLOR, THE PRESIDENT OF  MEXICO, AND THE POPE. HE SAYS HE HAS FOREIGN-POLICY  EXPERIENCE BECAUSE HE RAN THE MISS UNIVERSE PAGEANT IN RUSSIA. AND TO TOP IT OFF, HE BELIEVES AMERICA IS WEAK. HE CALLED OUR MILITARY A  DISASTER. HE SAID WE ARE A THIRD WORLD  COUNTRY. AND HE'S BEEN SAYING THINGS LIKE  THAT FOR DECADES.  THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF SOMEONE  WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND AMERICA  OR THE WORLD. AND THEY ARE THE WORDS OF SOMEONE WHO WOULD LEAD US IN THE  WRONG DIRECTION BECAUSE IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE AMERICA IS WEAK  WITH OUR MILITARY, VALUES, CAPABILITIES THAT NO OTHER  COUNTRY COMES CLOSE TO MATCHING, THEN YOU DON'T KNOW AMERICA. AND YOU CERTAINLY DON'T DESERVE  TO LEAD IT. THAT IS WHY EVEN IF I WEREN'T IN  THIS RACE, I WOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING I COULD TO MAKE SURE DONALD TRUMP NEVER BECOMES PRESIDENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE HE WILL TAKE OUR COUNTRY DOWN A  TRULY DANGEROUS PATH. UNLIKE HIM, I HAVE EXPERIENCE  WITH TOUGH CALLS. BROKERED A CEASE-FIRE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THOMAS, NEGOTIATED  WITH RUSSIA, TWISTED ARMS, AND  STOOD UP FOR THE RIGHTS OF  WOMEN, RELIGIOUS MINORITIES AND  THE RIGHTS OF LGBT PEOPLE AROUND  THE WORLD.  AND I HAVE SAT IN THE SITUATION ROOM AND ADVISE THE PRESIDENT ON  SOME OF THE TOUGHEST CHOICES HE  FACED. I AM NOT NEW TO THIS WORK AND I AM PROUD. AND A ROCKSOLID COMMITMENT TO  THE VALUES THAT HAVE ALWAYS MADE  AMERICA GREAT. AND I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART  THAT AMERICA IS AN EXCEPTIONAL  COUNTRY. THAT WE ARE STILL, IN LINCOLN'S WORDS, THE LAST BEST HOPE OF  EARTH. WE ARE NOT A COUNTRY THAT COWERS  BEHIND WALLS. WE LEAD WITH PURPOSE AND WE  PREVAIL. IF AMERICA DOESN'T LEAD, WE  LEAVE A VACUUM. IT WILL EITHER CAUSE CHAOS OR  OTHER COUNTRIES WILL RUSH TO  FILL THE VOID. THEY WILL BE THE ONES MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT LIVES AND JOBS. THE CHOICES THEY MAKE WILL NOT  BE OUR BENEFIT. THAT IS NOT AN OUTCOME WE CAN  LIVE WITH. THERE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS THE  NEXT PRESIDENT MUST DO TO KEEP US SAFE AND THE ECONOMY GROWING. THESE ARE AREAS THAT DONALD  TRUMP AND I PROFOUNDLY DISAGREE  AND THEY ARE ALL CRITICAL TO OUR  FUTURE. FIRST, WE NEED TO BE STRONG AT  HOME. THAT MEANS INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE, EDUCATION, AND  INNOVATION. WE NEED TO REDUCE INEQUALITY -- INCOME INEQUALITY BECAUSE SO  MANY ARE STRUGGLING TO PROVIDE  THE BASICS FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AND WE NEED TO BREAK DOWN THE  BARRIERS THAT HOLD AMERICANS BACK. COMPARE THAT WITH WHAT TRUMP  WANTS TO DO. HIS ECONOMIC PLAN WOULD ADD MORE  THAN 30 TRILLION, THAT'S WITH A T, DOLLARS TO THE NATIONAL DEBT. HE HAS NO IDEAS ON EDUCATION, NO  IDEAS ON INNOVATION. HE HAS A LOT OF IDEAS ABOUT WHO TO BLAME BUT NO CLUE ABOUT WHAT TO DO. NONE OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS  OFFERING WILL MAKE AMERICA  STRONGER AT HOME AND THAT WILL  MAKE US WEAKER IN THE WORLD. WE NEED TO STICK WITH OUR  ALLIES. AMERICA'S NETWORK IS PART OF WHAT MAKES US EXCEPTIONAL AND  OUR ALLIES DELIVER FOR US EVERY  DAY. OUR ARMED FORCES FIGHT TERRORISTS TOGETHER. OUR DIPLOMATS WORK SIDE BY SIDE. ALLIES PROVIDE STAGING AREAS FOR  MILITARY SO WE CAN RESPOND QUICKLY TO EVENTS ON OTHER SIDE  OF THE WORLD. THEY SHARE INTELLIGENCE THAT  HELP US IDENTIFY AND DIFFUSE  POTENTIAL THREATS. TAKE NORTH KOREA, PERHAPS THE  MOST REPRESSIVE REGIME ON THE PLANET RUN BY A SADISTIC DICTATOR WHO WANTS TO DEVELOP  LONG-RANGE MISSILES THAT CAN  CARRY A NUCLEAR WEAPON TO THE  UNITED STATES. WE WORKED CLOSELY WITH OUR ALLIES, JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA, TO RESPOND TO THIS THREAD INCLUDING WHY CREATING A MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM THAT STANDS READY  TO SHOOT DOWN A NORTH KOREAN WARHEAD SHOULD THE LEADERS THE  RECKLESS ENOUGH TO LAUNCH ONE. THE TECHNOLOGY IS OURS. KEY PARTS ARE LOCATED ON  JAPANESE SHIPS. ALL THREE COUNTRIES CONTRIBUTED  TO IT AND ALL THREE OF OUR MILITARIES WILL RUN A JOINT  DRILL TO TEST IT. THAT IS THE POWER OF ALLIES. IT IS ALSO THE LEGACY OF AMERICAN TROOPS THAT FONT AND  DIED TO SECURE THOSE BONDS. THEY KNEW WE WERE SAFER WITH  FRIENDS AND PARTNERS. MOSCOW AND BEIJING ARE DEEPLY ENVIOUS OF OUR ALLIANCES BECAUSE  THEY HAVE NOTHING TO MATCH THEM. THEY WOULD LOVE FOR US TO ELECT  A PRESIDENT THAT WOULD  JEOPARDIZE THAT SOURCE OF  STRENGTH. IF DONALD GETS HIS WAY, THEY  WILL BE CELEBRATING IN THE  KREMLIN. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. THAT'S WHY IT IS NO SMALL PASSING AND WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT LEAVING NATO OR SAYS HE WILL  STAY NEUTRAL ON ISRAEL. IT'S NO SMALL THING WHEN HE CALLS MEXICANS RAPISTS AND  MURDERERS. WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE TWO GOOD  FRIENDS ON BORDERS, WHY WOULD HE  WANT TO MAKE ONE OF THEM AND ENEMY? AND IT IS NO SMALL THING WHEN HE SUGGESTS AMERICA SHOULD WITHDRAW  MILITARY SUPPORT FOR JAPAN AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO GET NUCLEAR WEAPONS. AND HE SAID THIS ABOUT A WAR BETWEEN JAPAN AND NORTH KOREA. IF THEY DO, THEY DO. GOOD LUCK.  ENJOY YOURSELF, FOLKS. I WONDER IF HE EVEN REALIZES HE  IS TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR WAR. OUR FRIENDS NEED TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR FAIR SHARE. A NUMBER OF THEM HAVE INCREASED  THEIR DEFENSE SPENDING. THE REAL DEBATE IS IF WE KEEP THOSE ALLIANCES STRONG OR CUT THEM OFF. WHAT HE SAYS WOULD WEAKEN OUR  COUNTRY. WE NEED TO EMBRACE ALL THE TOOLS  OF AMERICAN POWER, ESPECIALLY DIPLOMACY AND DEVELOPMENT. TO BE ON THE FRONT LINES SOLVING PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY THREATEN US  AT HOME. DIPLOMACY COULD BE THE ONLY WAY TO AVOID A CONFLICT THAT COULD  END UP EXACTING A MUCH GREATER  COST. IT TAKES PATIENCE, PERSISTENCE,  AND AN EYE ON THE LONG GAME. TAKE THE NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN. IRAN WAS RACING TOWARD A NUCLEAR  BOMB. SOME CALLED FOR MILITARY ACTION. IT COULD HAVE IGNITED A BROADER WAR. PRESIDENT OBAMA CHOSE A DIFFERENT PATH AND I GOT TO LEAD  THE EFFORT TO IMPOSE CRIPPLING SANCTIONS. EVENTUALLY, WE REACHED AN  AGREEMENT THAT SHOULD BLOCK  EVERY PATH FOR IRAN TO GET A  NUCLEAR WEAPON. NOW WE MUST ENFORCE THE DEAL VIGOROUSLY. AND OUR APPROACH MUST BE THIS  TRUST AND VERIFY. THE WORLD MUST UNDERSTAND THE UNITED STATES WILL ACT  DECISIVELY IF NECESSARY,  INCLUDING WITH MILITARY ACTION TO STOP IRAN FROM GETTING A NUCLEAR WEAPON. ISRAEL'S SECURITY ARE  NONNEGOTIABLE. WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO  DEFEND ISRAEL. BUT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT  THE WORLD AND THE UNITED STATES,  WE ARE SAFER NOW THAN WE WERE  BEFORE DISAGREEMENT. WE ARE, LISTED WITHOUT FIRING A SINGLE SHOT OR PUTTING A SINGLE  AMERICAN SOLDIER IN HARM'S WAY. DONALD TRUMP SAYS WE SHOULD NOT  HAVE DONE THE DEAL. WE SHOULD HAVE WALKED AWAY. THAT WOULD HAVE MEANT NO MORE GLOBAL SANCTIONS AND IRAN RESUMING THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM  AND THE WORLD BLAMING US. THEN WHAT? MORE? -- WAR? OF COURSE, TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE  ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS. HE DOES NOT KNOW THE FIRST THING  ABOUT IRAN OR ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM.  ASK HIM. IT WILL BECOME VERY CLEAR VERY  QUICKLY. THERE IS NO RISK OF PEOPLE  LOSING THEIR LIVES IF YOU BLOW  UP A GOLF COURSE DEAL. BUT IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT IN  WORLD AFFAIRS. JUST LIKE BEING INTERVIEWED ON  THE SAME EPISODE OF 60 MINUTES  IS NOT THE SAME THING IS  ACTUALLY DEALING WITH VLADIMIR  PUTIN. SO THE STAKES ARE INFINITELY  HIGHER AND MORE COMPLEX IN THE  WORLD OF LUXURY HOTELS.  WE KNOW THE TOOLS DONALD TRUMP  RINGS TO THE TABLE. BRAGGING, MOCKING, COMPOSING NASTY TWEETS. I'M WILLING TO BET HE'S WRITING A FEW RIGHT NOW. BUT THOSE TOOLS WILL NOT DO THE TRICK. RATHER THAN SOLVING GLOBAL  CRISES, HE WILL CREATE NEW ONES. HE HAS NO SENSE OF WHAT IT TAKES TO DEAL WITH MULTIPLE COUNTRIES WITH COMPETING INTERESTS AND  REACHING A SOLUTION EVERYONE CAN  GET BEHIND. IN FACT, HE IS DOWNRIGHT  CONTEMPTUOUS OF THAT WORK. HE'S MORE LIKELY TO END UP  LEADING US INTO CONFLICT. WE NEED TO BE FIRM BUT WISE WITH  RIVALS. COUNTRIES OFTEN WORK AGAINST US. MOSCOW HAS TAKEN AGGRESSIVE  MILITARY ACTION IN UKRAINE. I HAVE GONE TOE TO TOE WITH RUSSIA, CHINA, AND MANY OTHER  LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD. I KNOW WE HAVE TO STAND OUR  GROUND WHEN WE MUST AND FIND  COMMON GROUND WHEN WE CAN. THAT IS HOW I CAN WORK WITH  RUSSIA TO REDUCE STOCKPILES AND  WITH CHINA TO INCREASE PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA. IT'S HOW DIPLOMATS NEGOTIATED A  LANDMARK AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE  CHANGE THAT TRUMP WANTS TO RIP  UP. THE KEY WAS NEVER FORGETTING WHO  WE WERE DEALING WITH. NOT FRIENDS OR ALLIES BUT COUNTRIES THAT SHARE A COMMON INTEREST. HE DOESN'T SEE THE COMPLEXITY. I UNDERSTAND A LOT OF AMERICANS  HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT OUR TRADE  AGREEMENTS. A TRADE WAR IS SOMETHING VERY  DIFFERENT. WE WENT DOWN THAT ROAD IN THE 1930'S AND IT MADE THE GREAT DEPRESSION LONGER AND MORE  PAINFUL. COMBINE THAT WITH HIS COMMENTS  ABOUT DEFAULTING ON OUR DEBT AND  IT IS NOT HARD TO SEE HOW A TRUMP PRESIDENCY COULD LEAD TO A  GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HIS BIZARRE FASCINATION WITH DICTATORS AND STRONG WHO HAVE NO LOVE FOR  AMERICA. HE PRAISED CHINA FOR THE  TIANANMEN SQUARE MASSACRE AND  SAID THAT IT SHOWED STRENGTH. HE SAID YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE HIM  CREDIT FOR TAKING OVER NORTH KOREA, SOMETHING HE DID BY  MURDERING EVERYONE HE SAW AS A  THREAT INCLUDING HIS OWN UNCLE  WHICH DONALD DESCRIBED GLEEFULLY LIKE HE WAS RECAPPING AN ACTION  MOVIE. AND HE SAID IF HE WERE RATING  VLADIMIR PUTIN AS A LEADER, HE  WILL GIVE HIM IN A. I JUST WONDER HOW ANYONE CAN BE SO WRONG ABOUT WHO AMERICA'S  REAL FRIENDS ARE. IF YOU DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHO  YOU ARE DEALING WITH, MEN LIKE  VLADIMIR PUTIN WILL EAT YOUR  LUNCH. WE NEED A REAL PLAN FOR  CONFRONTING TERRORISTS. AS WE SAW SIX MONTHS AGO IN SAN  BERNARDINO, THE THREAT IS REAL  AND URGENT. I HAVE LAID OUT MY PLANS FOR  DEFEATING ISIS. WE NEED TO TAKE OUT THEIR  STRONGHOLDS BY INTENSIFYING THE AIR CAMPAIGN AND STEPPING UP SUPPORT. WE NEED TO KEEP PURSUING DIPLOMACY. THOSE CONFLICTS ARE KEEPING ISIS  ALIVE. WE NEED TO LASH OUT AND ENSURE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ARE  WORKING HAND IN HAND TO  DISMANTLE THE GLOBAL NETWORK  THAT SUPPLIES MONEY, ARMED  PROPAGANDA, AND FIGHTERS TO THE TERRORISTS. AND WE NEED TO WIN THE BATTLE IN  CYBERSPACE. AND OF COURSE, WE NEED TO  STRENGTHEN OUR DEFENSES HERE AT  HOME. THAT, IN A NUTSHELL, IS MY PLAN  FOR DEFEATING ISIS.  WHAT IS TRUMP'S? HE WON'T SAY. HE IS LITERALLY KEEPING IT A  SECRET. HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE WOULD DO. LOOK AT THE FEW THINGS HE HAS  SAID ON THE SUBJECT. MAYBE SYRIA SHOULD BE A FREE  ZONE FOR ISIS. OK. LET THE TERRORIST GROUP HAVE  CONTROL OF A MAJOR COUNTRY? WE SHOULD SEND TENS OF THOUSANDS  OF AMERICAN GROUND TROOPS TO THE  MIDDLE EAST TO FIGHT ISIS.  HE ALSO REFUSED TO RULE OUT  NUCLEAR WEAPONS AGAINST ISIS  WHICH MEANS MASS CIVILIAN  CASUALTIES. IT'S CLEAR HE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. WE CAN BE CERTAIN HE IS CAPABLE OF DOING ANY OR ALL OF THEM. LETTING ISIS RUN WILD, LAUNCHING A NUCLEAR ATTACK, STARTING A  GROUND WAR. HE ARE ALL DISTINCT POSSIBILITIES. DEMONIZING MUSLIMS AND PLAYING  RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF ISIS. HIS PLAN TO BAN MUSLIMS FROM  EVEN COMING TO OUR COUNTRY  DOESN'T JUST TO VIOLATE THE  RELIGIOUS FREEDOM OUR COUNTRY  WAS FOUNDED ON, IT IS A HUGE  PROPAGANDA VICTORY FOR ISIS. AND IT ALIENATES THE VERY  COUNTRIES WE NEED TO HELP US WIN  IN THIS FIGHT. WE CANNOT TAKE THAT RISK.  IT ISN'T REALITY TELEVISION. IT TAKES MORE THAN EMPTY TALK AND A HANDFUL OF SLOGANS.  IT TAKES A REAL PLAN. AND ONE MORE THING. A PRESIDENT HAS A SACRED RESPONSIBILITY OF DEFENDING TROOPS IN BATTLE IF WE  ABSOLUTELY MUST. AND ONLY WITH THE CLEAR AND WELL THOUGHT OUT STRATEGY. OUR TROOPS GIVE THEIR ALL. I FOUGHT FOR BETTER HEALTH CARE. VETERANS WITH MORE SUPPORT FOR  OUR GOLD STAR FAMILIES. WE NEED TO STAY TRUE TO OUR  VALUES. THE WORLD IS LAUGHING AT US. HE DIDN'T JUST START THIS YEAR. WITH NEWSPAPERS IN 1987, AMERICA  LACKED A BACKBONE AND AMERICA WAS, YOU GUESSED IT, LAUGHING AT  US. YOU'VE GOT TO WONDER WHY SOMEBODY WHO FUNDAMENTALLY HAS  SO LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN AMERICA  AND HAS FELT THAT WAY WANTS TO BE OUR PRESIDENT. THERE IS NOT A COUNTRY IN THE  WORLD THAT CAN RIVAL US. IT'S ALSO THAT AMERICANS WORK  HARDER, DREAM BIGGER, AND WE NEVER STOP MAKING OUR COUNTRY  AND THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.  IT MATTERS THAT DONALD TRUMP  SAYS THINGS THAT GO AGAINST OUR  DEEPEST HELD VALUES.  IT MATTERS WHEN HE SAYS HE WILL ORDER OUR MILITARY TO MURDER THE  FAMILIES OF SUSPECTED  TERRORISTS. DURING THE RAID TO KILL OSAMA  BIN LADEN, WHEN EVERY SECOND COUNTED, OUR SEALS TOOK THE TIME TO MOVE THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THE COMPOUND TO SAFETY. DONALD TRUMP MAY NOT GET IT, BUT  THAT IS WHAT HONOR LOOKS LIKE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IT ALSO MATTERS WHEN HE MAKES  FUN OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. CALLS WOMEN. . PROPOSES BANNING AN ENTIRE RELIGION OR PLAYS COY WITH WHITE  SUPREMACISTS. AMERICA STANDS UP TO COUNTRIES THAT TREAT WOMEN LIKE ANIMALS OR  PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT RACES,  RELIGIONS, OR ETHNICITIES AS LESS HUMAN. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MORAL  EXAMPLE WE SET FOR THE WORLD AND  FOR OUR OWN CHILDREN IF OUR  PRESIDENT ENGAGES IN BIGOTRY? AND BY THE WAY, EVERY TIME YOU INSULT AMERICAN MUSLIMS OR MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS, REMEMBER  PLENTY IMMIGRANTS SERVE AND  FIGHT IN OUR ARMED FORCES. DONALD TRUMP COULD LEARN  SOMETHING FROM THEM. IT BRINGS ME TO THE FINAL POINT. THE TEMPERAMENT IT TAKES TO BE  COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. EVERY PRESIDENT FACES HARD  CHOICES EVERY DAY WITH IMPERFECT INFORMATION AND CONFLICTING  IMPERATIVES. THAT IS THE JOB. AN ADVERSARY REACHES OUT FOR THE  FIRST TIME IN YEARS.  WHAT DO YOU DO? MAKING THE RIGHT CALL TAKES A  COOL HEAD AND RESPECT ARE THE  FACTS. IT TAKES A WILLINGNESS TO LISTEN  TO OTHER PEOPLE'S POINTS OF VIEW  WITH A TRULY OPEN MIND. IT ALSO TAKES HUMILITY KNOWING  THAT YOU DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING. IF YOU ARE CONVINCED YOU ARE  ALWAYS RIGHT, YOU WILL NEVER ASK  YOURSELF THE HARD QUESTIONS. I REMEMBER BEING IN THE  SITUATION ROOM WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA DEBATING THE POTENTIAL BIN  LADEN OPERATION. THE PRESIDENT'S ADVISERS WERE  DIVIDED. THE INTELLIGENCE WAS COMPELLING  BUT FAR FROM DEFINITIVE.  AND THE RISKS OF FAILURE WERE  DAUNTING. THE STAKES WERE SIGNIFICANT. MOST OF ALL, THE LIVES OF THOSE  HUNG IN THE BALANCE. IT WAS A DECISION ONLY A  PRESIDENT COULD MAKE. AND WHEN HE DID, IT WAS AS CRISP AND COURAGEOUS A I HAVE EVER  SEEN. IMAGINE DONALD TRUMP SITTING IN THE SITUATION ROOM MAKING LIFE OR DEATH DECISIONS ON BEHALF OF  THE UNITED STATES. IMAGINE HIM DECIDING WHETHER TO  SEND IT YOUR SPOUSES OR CHILDREN  INTO BATTLE. IMAGINE IF HE HAD NOT JUST HIS  TWITTER ACCOUNT AT HIS DISPOSAL  BUT AMERICA'S ENTIRE ARSENAL. DO WE WANT HIM MAKING THOSE  CALLS? SOMEONE QUICK TO ANGER WHO  LASHES OUT AT THE SMALLEST  CRITICISM. DO WE WANT HIS FINGER ANYWHERE NEAR THE BUTTON? I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN THE  RIGHT DECISION. THIS IS A COUNTRY WITH A DEEP RESERVOIR OF COMMON SENSE AND NATIONAL PRIDE. WE ARE ALL COUNTING ON THAT. BECAUSE MAKING DONALD TRUMP OUR  COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WOULD BE A HISTORIC MISTAKE AND IT WOULD UNDO SO MUCH OF THE WORK THAT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE  HAVE DONE.  OVER MANY DECADES, MAKING  AMERICA STRONGER AND MORE  SECURE. IT WOULD SET BACK OUR STANDING  IN THE WORLD MORE THAN ANYTHING  IN RECENT MEMORY. IT WOULD FUEL AND UGLY NARRATIVE ABOUT WHO WE ARE. THAT WE ARE FEARFUL, NOT CONFIDENT, INSTEAD OF SHAPING  OUR OWN DESTINY. THAT IS NOT THE AMERICA I KNOW  AND LOVE. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO  KEEP OUR COUNTRY SECURE AND WE NEED TO DO BETTER BY AMERICAN FAMILIES AND WORKERS. DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU  AMERICA ISN'T GREAT. DONALD TRUMP HAS AMERICA ALL  WRONG. WE ARE A BIG HEARTED AND  FAIR-MINDED COUNTRY. THERE IS NO GOAL WE CAN'T ACHIEVE WHEN WE EACH DO OUR PART  AND COME TOGETHER. EVERY LESSON TEACHES US THAT WE  ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. WE REMEMBER THAT EVERY MEMORIAL  DAY. THIS IS A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO VERY DIFFERENT VISIONS OF  AMERICA. ONE THAT IS ANGRY, AFRAID, AND  BASED ON THE IDEA THAT AMERICA IS FUNDAMENTALLY WEAK.  THE OTHER IS HOPEFUL, GENEROUS, AND CONFIDENT THAT AMERICA IS GREAT JUST LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE  BEEN. SO LET'S RESOLVE THAT WE CAN BE  GREATER STILL. I NEVER LOST MY SENSE OF PRIDE AND WONDER AT SEEING THE BLUE  AND LIGHT PLANE LIT UP ON SOME  RUNWAY WITH THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA EMBLAZONED ON THE SIDES. IT REPRESENTS SOMETHING SPECIAL. I LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND I KNOW YOU DO, TOO.  IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE. I WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO  MAKE SURE WE NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF  HOW STRONG WE REALLY ARE. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.     ",Hillary Clinton National Security Policy Address

WOW. I AM SO, SO EXCITED ABOUT BEING HERE.  I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO BE IN THIS CITY WHERE,  AS THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR JUST  SAID, IS A CITY ALL ABOUT THE FUTURE.  ALL ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE  ECONOMY, THE FUTURE OF OUR SOCIETY, HOW WE ARE GOING TO BE  STRONGER TOGETHER. AND I WANT TO THANK GAVIN  NEWSOM FOR BEING HERE AND FOR  HIS LIFETIME OF SERVICE TO THIS STATE. AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO HAVE SOMEONE  WHO IS A PROGRESSIVE, WHO LIKES  TO GET THINGS DONE, JUST LIKE  ME, STANDING ON THIS STAGE.  I WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, MAYOR!   WANT TO THANK LARRY STONE, THE ASSESSOR HERE IN THE COUNTY, ALL THE ELECTED OFFICIALS. BUT MOSTLY I WANT TO THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU FOR BEING HERE.   NOW, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU RUN FOR  OFFICE AND PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT, YOU ALWAYS COME AND TELL BIG CROWDS  LIKE THIS, THIS IS THE MOST  IMPORTANT ELECTION, DON'T YOU? YOU HEAR THAT. I HAPPEN TO THINK EVERY  ELECTION IS IMPORTANT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION.   BECAUSE WE'VE GOT SOME BIG DECISIONS TO MAKE AS A COUNTRY. AND THERE COULD NOT BE A STARKER DIFFERENCE THAN THERE IS BETWEEN ME AND NOW AS OF TODAY THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, DONALD TRUMP.   YOU KNOW, I'M  PROUD OF THE CAMPAIGN THAT SENATOR SANDERS AND I HAVE RUN. WE HAVE RUN A CAMPAIGN ON ISSUES ABOUT THE FUTURE. WE BOTH WANT UNIVERSAL HEALTH  CARE COVERAGE. WE BOTH WANT TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE WITHIN THE REACH OF EVERY YOUNG PERSON WHO WANTS TO GO TO A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. WE BOTH WANT TO REIN IN AND PREVENT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE GREAT RECESSION WITH THE MISDEEDS OF WALL STREET FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN. WE ARE ON THE SAME PAGE.  SO, WE'RE GOING TO BE COMING TOGETHER AS A UNIFIED DEMOCRATIC PARTY. TO MAKE OUR CASE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. BECAUSE WE, SENATOR SANDERS AND I, OUR SUPPORTERS TOGETHER HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WE DO WITH DONALD TRUMP!    PEOPLE SAY TO ME, YOU TALK ABOUT TRUMP A LOT. AND I DO AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE WHAT HE IS SAYING IS DANGEROUS AND DIVISIVE.  WHAT HE IS SAYING IS HARMFUL TO  OUR FUTURE AND OUR COUNTRY.  OUR PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT OBAMA,  IS --    -- IS IN JAPAN TODAY MEETING WITH OUR CLOSEST ALLIES, AND WHEN HE CAME OUT OF THE MEETING  AND WENT TO THE FORMAL PRESS CONFERENCE THAT ENDS EVENTS  LIKE THAT, HE SAID, HE REPORTED  THAT THE LEADERS OF OUR FRIENDS  ARE, I QUOTE, RATTLED, RATTLED BY WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING.  AND WHAT HE IS PROMOTING.  AND WHAT HE STANDS FOR.  WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THE  BEST WAY TO REASSURE OURSELVES AND THE REST OF THE WORLD IS TO  MAKE SURE THAT DONALD TRUMP, THIS LOOSE CANNON, NEVER GETS  CLOSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE!   YOU KNOW, IT WAS BAD ENOUGH  WHEN HE STARTED HIS CAMPAIGN IN  HIS VERY FIRST HOUR CRITICIZING AND INSULTING IMMIGRANTS. YOU KNOW, HE CALLED IMMIGRANTS RAPISTS, MURDERERS, CRIMINALS. IT WAS DISGRACEFUL. AND THEN HE WENT ON TO INSULT WOMEN, TO INSULT JOHN MCCAIN, A  WAR HERO, TO INSULT, TO MAKE FUN OF A MAN WITH A DISABILITY, TO DENIGRATE MUSLIMS. HONEST TO GOODNESS, THERE'S NOBODY LEFT BY THE TIME HE GETS FINISHED WITH CRITICIZING EVERYBODY HE CAN.  THAT IS NO WAY TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES!    I'M TELLING YOU, I AM SO LOOKING FORWARD TO DEBATING DONALD TRUMP, I CAN'T WAIT!    BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING  TO TALK ABOUT. WHAT IS OUR POSITIVE VISION?  I HAVE IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO  CREATE MORE GOOD JOBS WITH RISING INCOMES, WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE, OUR  ROADS, OUR BRIDGES, OUR  TUNNELS, OUR PORTS, OUR WATER SYSTEMS.   WE ARE GOING TO FINISH THE JOB OF CONNECTING UP AMERICA SO  EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO  AFFORDABLE INTERNET CONNECTION!  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THINGS IN AMERICA AGAIN BY INCENTIVIZING ADVANCED MANUFACTURING.  YOU KNOW, HERE IN CALIFORNIA YOU ARE INVENTING THE FUTURE.  NEW TECHNOLOGIES, NEW RESEARCH EVERY SINGLE YEAR. WELL, LET'S MAKE THOSE PRODUCTS  IN AMERICA AGAIN!  AND LET'S AGREE TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH DONALD  TRUMP CALLS A CHINESE HOAX,  HONESTLY, YOU KNOW, YOU HEARD ALL THE REPUBLICANS WHEN THEY WERE RUNNING.  PART OF THE REASON THE REPUBLICANS HAVE ENDED UP WITH DONALD TRUMP IS BECAUSE THEY COULD NEVER CRITICIZE HIM ABOUT ISSUES BECAUSE THEY BASICALLY AGREE WITH HIM ABOUT ISSUES, RIGHT? SO, WHEN THE REPUBLICANS WERE ASKED, WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, THEY ALWAYS SAID, OH, I DON'T KNOW, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST. WELL, THEY CAN GO TO SAN JOSE STATE AND FIND A SCIENTIST AND FIGURE OUT ALL ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE.   ONE OF THE WAYS WE'RE GOING TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS BY INVESTING IN AND CREATING JOBS IN CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY!   I HAVE SAID -- SET TWO BIG GOALS. I WANT US TO DEPLOY A HALF BILLION MORE SOLAR PANELS BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM. AND ENOUGH CLEAN ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME IN AMERICA BY THE END OF MY SECOND TERM. THAT WILL NOT ONLY PUT THE UNITED STATES IN THE LEAD ON DEALING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT IT WILL ALSO CREATE A NEW ECONOMY BECAUSE THINK ABOUT THIS, SOME COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER, IT'S EITHER GOING TO BE CHINA, GERMANY OR US. I WANT IT TO BE US, DON'T YOU?  AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT MILLIONS OF JOBS IN INFRASTRUCTURE, MANUFACTURING AND CLEAN ENERGY, THESE ARE  JOBS THAT CAN'T BE OUTSOURCED. THESE ARE JOBS THAT HAVE TO BE DONE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS AMERICA. NOW, WHAT DOES DONALD TRUMP PROPOSE? HE PROPOSES TO BUILD A WALL. A WALL. NOW, HONESTLY, WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ABOUT THAT WALL. WE FIGURE IT WOULD COST ABOUT  $25 BILLION. NOW, THINK OF WHAT ELSE WE COULD USE $25 BILLION FOR. WE COULD BUILD 1,500 NEW ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS SO KIDS HAVE  A CHANCE TO GO TO A MODERN,  GOOD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.  WE COULD PAY FOR COLLEGE FOR 300,000 VETERANS IF WE DID THAT.  SO THERE'S A LOT THAT WE WILL  HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WHEN WE FINALLY GET TO STAND ON THAT STAGE TOGETHER.  AND THE OTHER THING ABOUT  TRUMP'S POLICIES IS, HE DOESN'T  GIVE YOU SPECIFICS.  HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT? IT'S A PRETTY MUCH A TOP LINE, TOP OF THE WATER SORT OF PROPOSAL.  AND YET ONE THING WE DO KNOW,  WHEN IT COMES TO TAX POLICIES, HE HAS TWO IDEAS.  ONE, HE WANTS TO HAVE  BILLIONAIRES GET EVEN LOWER TAXES. HIS TAX PLAN IS WRITTEN BY A BILLIONAIRE FOR BILLIONAIRES.  BEST I CAN TELL. AND HE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO SEE HIS TAXES. THOSE ARE HIS TWO PRINCIPLES WHEN IT COMES TO TAXES.  NOW, I DISAGREE WITH THAT. NUMBER ONE, I THINK WE SHOULD  TAX THE WEALTHY. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PAYING THEIR  FAIR SHARE TO SUPPORT AMERICA.  AND NUMBER TWO, MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE RELEASED 33 YEARS OF TAX RETURNS. AND THE ONLY TWO YEARS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS RELEASED, HE HAD TO RELEASE TO GET A CASINO, SO HE HAD TO COME UP WITH HIS INCOME TAX RETURN. THE ONLY TWO YEARS HE'S RELEASED HE PAID ZERO IN FEDERAL INCOME TAX. ZERO. AND YET HE GOES AROUND SAYING HE WANTS TO BUILD UP THE MILITARY, MAKE IT THE STRONGEST IN THE WORLD. WELL, IT IS THE STRONGEST IN THE WORLD. AND I WILL KEEP IT THE STRONGEST IN THE WORLD. BUT HE WON'T PAY A PENNY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SO ANYBODY WHO'S EVER BEEN NOMINATED BY A MAJOR PARTY HAS HAD TO COME UP WITH THEIR TAX RETURNS. AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT  THIS EVERY DAY. BECAUSE EITHER HE PAID NO TAXES  OR HE'S PAID VERY LITTLE. THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT WHICH IT IS IS FOR HIM TO  RELEASE. EITHER HE'S AS WEALTHY AS HE CLAIMS OR MAYBE HE'S NOT, THE  ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT IS FOR HIM  TO RELEASE.  MAYBE HE'S REALLY CHARITABLE,  OR MAYBE HE'S NOT. ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT IS FOR HIM  TO RELEASE.  SO, THE TIME TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS!   THE OTHER THING IS, THE OTHER  THING IS, YOU NEVER HEAR DONALD  TRUMP TALK ABOUT EDUCATION.  HE NEVER SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT IT, AS BEST AS I'VE HEARD. HERE'S WHERE I STAND.  WE NEED EARLY CHILDHOOD  EDUCATION SO EVERY SINGLE CHILD  IS WELL PREPARED TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL.  WE NEED TO BE A PARTNER WITH OUR TEACHERS TO HELP THEM DO THE JOB THAT WE EXPECT THEM TO DO ON BEHALF OF OUR KIDS.  WE NEED TO MAKE COMMUNITY  COLLEGE FREE SO THAT YOU CAN GET THE ADDITIONAL TRAINING, SKILLS, AND EDUCATION TO GET A JOB. WE NEED MORE TECHNICAL EDUCATION THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL  PROGRAMS, COMMUNITY COLLEGE  PROGRAMS, BUSINESS SUPPORT,  UNION SUPPORTED  APPRENTICESHIPS, WE NEED TO  HAVE MORE WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO GET THE SKILLS THAT WILL BE  COMPETITIVE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES.  I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT.  NOBODY WORKS HARDER THAN AMERICANS. NOBODY.  NOBODY IN THE WORLD WORKS  HARDER THAN AMERICANS. AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR EVERY YOUNG PERSON, AND MAYBE NOT SO YOUNG PERSON, TO GET THE SKILLS THAT WILL ENABLE THAT PERSON TO HAVE  A GOOD JOB WITH A RISING INCOME. EDUCATION IS A PART OF THAT.  THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU TO HAVE  DEBT FREE TUITION. YOU WON'T HAVE TO BORROW A PENNY TO GO TO A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. AND WE HAVE A PLAN TO HELP YOU PAY DOWN AND PAY OFF YOUR DEBT SO YOU'RE NOT BURDENED BY YOUR STUDENT DEBT WHICH IS SUCH A PROBLEM. SO I THINK WHAT I'M PROPOSING WILL HELP TO GROW THE ECONOMY. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, IT'S JUST A HISTORIC FACT, THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER WHEN WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE.  AND YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE REPUBLIC.  GO BACK TO THE 1990'S. AFTER EIGHT YEARS, 23 MILLION  NEW JOBS, AND INCOMES WENT UP  FOR EVERYBODY, NOT JUST THOSE  AT THE TOP, MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES, WORKING FAMILIES,  POOR FAMILIES. MORE PEOPLE LIFTED OUT OF  POVERTY THAN ANY TIME IN RECENT HISTORY. WE WERE ON THE RIGHT TRACK.  WE EVEN HAD A BALANCED BUDGET  AND A SURPLUS. WE COULD HAVE PAID DOWN THE  NATIONAL DEBT. SO WHAT HAPPENS? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS.  THE REPUBLICANS CAME BACK AND  SLASHED TAXES ON THE WEALTHY,  TOOK THEIR EYES OFF THE  MORTGAGE AND FINANCE MARKETS,  AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.  THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION. AND IT IS TRUE AS GAVIN WAS SAYING.  THERE'S SOME VIDEO THAT  SURFACED WHERE DONALD TRUMP IS ACTUALLY ROOTING, ROOTING FOR A  HOUSING COLLAPSE.  BECAUSE HE SAYS, WELL, I'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. CON ARTIST.  FIVE MILLION HOMES WERE  LOST.  A LOT OF HOMES RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WHERE I JUST WAS  IN NEVADA. THINK OF THE HEART BREAK.  THINK OF THE SUFFERING AND DISAPPOINTMENT. WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. HE ROOTS FOR HIMSELF, NOT FOR YOU. HE WANTS A GOOD RESULT FOR HIMSELF. HE DOESN'T CARE WHO GETS HURT  IN THE PROCESS.  THAT IS NOT -- THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF PERSON WHO SHOULD BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES OF AMERICA. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. AND YOU KNOW, WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE, HE WANTS TO DO  AWAY WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. I'LL TELL YOU, I WANT TO MAKE  IT BETTER. I WANT TO IMPROVE IT.  I WANT TO GET THE COSTS DOWN.  BEFORE THERE WAS SOMETHING CALLED OBAMACARE, THERE WAS SOMETHING CALLED HILLARYCARE, I  AM COMMITTED TO DO -- TO DOING THIS.   AND WE'RE GOING TO GET PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS DOWN AND THERE'S TWO OTHER ISSUES WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS.  MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION. THERE IS JUST TOO MUCH SUFFERING. PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ARE NOT GETTING THE TREATMENT THEY DESERVE TO GET.  AND THERE STILL IS A STIGMA. WE'VE GOT TO STOP THIS.  PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIABETES SHOULD GET TREATED JUST LIKE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEPRESSION SHOULD GET TREATED. AND WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE, WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE TO MOVE PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED ONTO THE PATH FOR TREATMENT AND RECOVERY, NOT ONTO THE PATH FOR JAIL OR PRISON. THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT DECISION. SO I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO DEBATING JOBS, THE ECONOMY, TAXES, EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE. AND I'M ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO DEBATING WHAT IS ONE OF THE  MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF YOUR DECISION WHEN YOU VOTE.  THAT IS VOTING FOR SOMEONE WHO IS BOTH PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER  IN CHIEF.  LOOK, I UNDERSTAND WHY PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS IN THAT  MEETING AND TRYING TO FIELD ALL  THE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS FROM  LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD.  BECAUSE LOOK AT WHAT TRUMP HAS SAID IN RECENT DAYS. HE'S ATTACKED OUR CLOSEST ALLY,  GREAT BRITAIN. HE HAS PRAISED THE DANGEROUS DICTATOR OF NORTH KOREA. NOW THIS IS A LITTLE FUNNY, THOUGH.  HE PRAISED KIM JONG UNAND THE  NORTH KOREAN -- KIM JONG UN, AND THE NORTH KOREAN AMBASSADOR  CAME OUT YESTERDAY AND SAID  THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK TO DONALD TRUMP.   I DON'T ATTRIBUTE A LOT OF GOOD  SENSE TO THAT REGIME BUT THAT'S  PROBABLY THE RIGHT DECISION.  TRUMP IS EVEN -- HAS EVEN  SUGGESTED THAT IT'S FINE WITH  HIM IF MORE COUNTRIES GET  NUCLEAR WEAPONS, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE.  FOR 70-PLUS YEARS, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, WE HAVE BEEN  TRYING TO KEEP NUCLEAR WEAPONS OUT OF MORE COUNTRIES' HANDS AND CERTAINLY OUT OF MORE  TERRORISTS' HANDS. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS RISKS WE FACE. YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS LIKE, YOU KNOW, IT'S A WALK IN THE PARK.  HE'S EVEN SAID HE'D USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AGAINST ISIS, WHICH IS NOT EVEN A STATE. HE WANTS TO RETURN TO TORTURE, HE WANTS TO PULL OUT OF NATO HE, WANTS TO BAN ALL MUSLIMS. I MEAN, REALLY. I COULD SEE WHY PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID HIS COUNTERPARTS WERE RATTLED. THEY'RE WATCHING THIS. WHEN YOU MAKE THESE ABSURD, OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENT, THAT'S NOT JUST HEARD IN THE BIG HALL WHERE YOU TALK.  THAT'S HEARD AROUND THE WORLD. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO COUNT ON  THE UNITED STATES ARE -- OUR STEADINESS, OUR STRENGTH, OUR  STABILITY, THEY LOOK TO WHO IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. THEY LOOK TO WHO IS PRESIDENT. A LOT OF PLACES, IT IS THE BEACON THAT KEEPS THEM GOING,  TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS AMERICA DOING. WHAT IS THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT SAYING.  YOU THINK ABOUT THE RECENT PRESIDENTS WE'VE HAD.  WE MAY HAVE DISAGREED AND HAD  REALLY SERIOUS DIFFERENCES, RIGHT? THAT'S PART OF THE AMERICAN D.N.A. BUT I REMEMBER AFTER 9/11, GEORGE W. BUSH WENT TO AN  FLORIDA STATEISLAMIC COMMUNITY CENTER.  REMEMBER THAT? AND BASICALLY SAID, WE ARE GOING TO GO AFTER THOSE WHO  ATTACKED US, BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ATTACKING EACH OTHER. AND PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS WORKED SO HARD TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE EVERYWHERE.  AND YOU KNOW, IT MATTERS WHO IS  SITTING IN THAT SITUATION ROOM.  I SPENT A LOT OF HOURS THERE. I SPENT A LOT OF HOURS --    I'LL JUST GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE. IT'S A FAMOUS EXAMPLE. IT'S WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT WOULD GO AFTER LANE BASED ON THE EVIDENCE, THE INTELLIGENCE -- AFTER BIN LADEN  BASED ON THE EVIDENCE, THE INTELLIGENCE THAT WE HAD, AND I  WAS PART OF THE SMALL GROUP ASSESSING THIS INTELLIGENCE. AND WE WORKED SO HARD BECAUSE I PERSONALLY HAVING BEEN A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK ON 9/11, HAVING GONE TO GROUND ZERO 24 HOURS AFTER WE WERE ATTACKED, I WANTED TO DO ANYTHING I COULD TO BRING LANE TO JUSTICE.  -- TO BRING BIN LAUD TON JUSTICE. WE HAD TO EVALUATE THIS INTELLIGENCE, WITH THIS -- WAS THIS FUNNY LOOKING BIG BUILDING  A PLACE WHERE THE MOST WANTED  TERRORIST IN THE WORLD COULD BE  HIDING OUT?  WE ALL WENT THROUGH IT OVER AND  OVER AGAIN.  IT CAME DOWN TO THREE CHOICES. DON'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO ACT ON.  IT'S OK BUT WE DON'T WANT TO RISK SPECIAL FORCES TO SO LET'S  USE A MISSILE TO TAKE THIS PLACE OUT. OR, IT'S THE BEST CHANCE WE'VE HAD TO GET HIM SO LET'S SEND IN  A SEAL TEAM. AND THEN THE PRESIDENT WENT  AROUND THE ROOM, AROUND THE  TABLE, AND ASKED EVERYBODY WHAT  WE RECOMMENDED.  AND PEOPLE WHO I DEEPLY  RESPECT, WE WERE NOT ALL IN AGREEMENT. SOME PEOPLE SAID NO. SHOULDN'T DO IT. SOME PEOPLE SAID IT'S NOT WORTH  THE RISK OF A SPECIAL FORCES TEAM GOING IN, BUT IF WE THINK IT'S GOOD ENOUGH, TAKE THE MISSILE STRIKE.  I WAS AMONG THOSE WHO SAID NO, WE HAVE TO FIND OUT. IF WE DO A MISSILE STRIKE, WE'LL NEVER FIND OUT.  WE'LL NEVER KNOW.  SO WE ALL GAVE OUR ADVICE. BUT THEN THAT MOMENT COMES.  THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT. WHERE THE PRESIDENT GETS UP AND SAYS HE'S GOING TO GO THINK  ABOUT THIS.  BECAUSE ULTIMATELY, YOU CAN  HAVE ALL THE ADVISOR, ALL THE  PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERTS. BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS TO MAKE THE DECISION. AND YOU KNOW HE CAME BACK, AND HE SAID, YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH THE SALE TEAM AND WE -- THE SEAL TEAM, AND WE ALL HELD OUR BREATH THAT DAY WHEN THE ATTACK OCCURRED. WE WERE ALL JUST UNDER THE MOST  INTENSE STRESS.  THERE WERE A LOT OF -- THERE WAS A LOT OF PLANNING. PEOPLE HAD DONE EVERYTHING THEY COULD. THE MILITARY WAS SUPERB, THINKING THROUGH EVERY POSSIBLE  CONTINGENCY, BUT THINGS  HAPPEN.  ONE OF THOSE HELICOPTERS CLIPPED THE BARBED WIRE ON TOP OF THE WALL AND WENT DOWN. BUT EVERYTHING HAD BEEN THOUGHT THROUGH. SO BIN LADEN WAS FOUND, HE WAS KILLED, HIS BODY WAS BROUGHT ACROSS THE BORDER AND HE WAS IDENTIFIED.  AND --   NO PRESIDENT WANTS TO SEEK OUT THOSE KINDS OF SITUATIONS, BUT EVERY PRESIDENT FACES THOSE  HARD CHOICES.  WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN BE STEADY AND STRONG AND I PROMISE  YOU I WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM AND I WILL PROTECT OUR COUNTRY AND HELP TO LEAD THE WORLD.  NOW, FINALLY, LET ME SAY THIS.  THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES  THAT TRUMP HAS STAKED OUT. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHERE I STAND IN COMPARISON. I WILL DEFEND A WOMAN'S RIGHT  TO MAKE HER OWN HEALTH CARE DECISIONS.   AND I WILL DEFEND PLANNED  PARENTHOOD AGAINST THE PARTISAN ATTACKS. I WILL DEFEND MARRIAGE EQUALITY  AND WORK TO END DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY. I WILL DEFEND VOTING RIGHTS AND APPOINT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES THAT WILL OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED. I WILL DEFEND LABOR UNIONS AND THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY. I WILL FIGHT FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP.  AND I WILL STAND UP TO THE GUN LOBBY AND WORK TO GET COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY REFORM. NOW, I CAN'T DO ANY OF THIS  WITHOUT YOUR HELP. I WANT TO UNIFY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND I WANT TO UNIFY THE  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  I WILL GO ANYWHERE, TO MEET  WITH ANYONE TO FIND COMMON GROUND.  I WILL ALSO STAND MY GROUND.  BUT WE'VE GOT TO BRING THIS  COUNTRY TOGETHER.  WE DO NOT NEED TO BE DIVIDED. AS LINCOLN SAID A HOUSE DIVIDED  AGAINST ITSELF CANNOT STAND. WE CANNOT STAND THIS KIND OF HATE TALK AND RHETORIC AND DEMAGOGUERY. SO HERE IS WHAT I'M ASKING YOU. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN A BALLOT SENT TO YOUR HOUSE, FILL  IT IN AND SEND IT IN. YOU CAN STILL GET A BALLOT ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH MAY 31 IF YOU WANT TO VOTE LIKE THAT.  AND PLEASE DO. IF YOU THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE  TROUBLE GETTING TO THE POLLS ON  JUNE 7.  AND THEN ON JUNE 7, PLEASE, COME OUT AND VOTE AND BRING EVERYBODY YOU CAN WHO KNOWS WE'VE GOT TO START RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA MAKING THE FUTURE THAT WE WANT TO SEE FOR OUR COUNTRY, FOR OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN.

DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGNED IN KENTUCKY AT A CAMPAIGN IN LOUISVILLE SHE TOLD KENTUCKY THEY MUST WIN IN NOVEMBER. THIS IS ABOUT 30 MINUTES.   MRS. CLINTON: HELLO, LOUISVILLE! IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU. I WANT TO THANK YOUR ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SECRETARY OF STATE, MY FRIEND ALISON LUNDERGREN GRIMES. THANK YOU, ALLISON. I WANT TO ALSO THANK MAYOR GREG FISHER, WHO IS HERE SOMEWHERE. THANK YOU MAYOR! BUT MOSTLY I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE WITH US ON THIS RAINY AFTERNOON. WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE PRIMARY NEXT TUESDAY.   YOU KNOW, THESE ELECTIONS ARE ALWAYS IMPORTANT. THAT IS HOW WE GOVERN OURSELVES. I BELIEVE THAT. BUT BOY DO I THINK THIS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HAS ABOUT THE HIGHEST STAKES WE HAVE SEEN IN A REALLY LONG TIME. YOU COULD NOT IMAGINE A MORE DIFFERENT VISION FOR OUR COUNTRY THAN THE ONE BETWEEN OUR SIDE OF DEMOCRATS FOR PROGRESS, FOR PROSPERITY, FOR FAIRNESS AND OPPORTUNITY THEN THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AND --    THAT IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT WE HAVE A BIG VOTE ON NEXT TUESDAY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY TO NOVEMBER TO WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION! YOU KNOW, THE WAY I SEE THIS, WE HAVE GOT TO BREAK DOWN ALL OF THE BARRIERS THAT STAND IN THE WAY OF ANY AMERICAN GETTING AHEAD AND STAYING AHEAD AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS NOW FOR ABOUT A YEAR AS I HAVE CRISSCROSSED THE COUNTRY TALKING TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. BECAUSE YES, WE HAVE TO KNOCK DOWN THE ECONOMIC BARRIERS BUT THERE ARE OTHER BARRIERS THAT PREVENT PEOPLE FROM FULFILLING THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL AND I WANT YOU WITH ME TO BE ABSOLUTELY ON THE FRONT OF LINES OF MAKING SURE THAT THE AMERICAN DREAM IS WITHIN REACH OF EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY.   NUMBER ONE, WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE MORE GOOD JOBS WITH RISING INCOME AND I WILL TELL YOU IT IS A HISTORICAL FACT THAT THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER WHEN WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE. I KNOW OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS HATE IT WHEN I SAY THAT. BUT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT THE RECORD OF THE LAST TWO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS TO GET ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU NEED. AS I VAGUELY REMEMBER, I KNOW IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO, BUT AS I VAGUELY REMEMBER, WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS PRESIDENT WE ENDED UP WITH 23 MILLION NEW JOBS. AND INCOMES THAT ROSE FOR EVERYBODY. THAT IS AN IMPORTANT FACT BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT INCOME JUST TO RISE FOR SOME. WE WANT THEM TO RISE FOR EVERYBODY, NOT JUST PEOPLE AT THE TOP. AND WHEN BILL WAS PRESIDENT, THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. MORE PEOPLE LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY. MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME OF 17%. -- GOING UP 17%. MEDIAN AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILY INCOME UP 33%. EVERYBODY DID BETTER. THAT IS THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN AMERICA. THAT IS HOW I WAS RAISED. YOU DO YOUR PART, YOU WORK HARD, YOU GET AHEAD. YOUR KIDS WILL HAVE A BETTER LIFE THAN YOU DID. THAT IS WHAT I WANT PEOPLE TO BELIEVE AND THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE HAPPENS. SO YOU MIGHT ASK YOURSELF, OK. IF THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 1990'S, WHY DID IT FALL APART? THERE IS KIND OF AN EASY ANSWER FOR THAT. WE HAD A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT. AND I WILL TELL YOU, THIS IS SERIOUS BECAUSE I THINK WE HAD A BALANCED BUDGET SURPLUS. WE HAD NEW JOBS. RISING INCOME. AND NOW WE CAN LOOK BACK AND SEE THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD A RAISE FOR MOST AMERICANS IN ABOUT 16 YEARS. FAMILY INCOME IS ABOUT $4000 LESS THAN IT WAS WHEN MY HUSBAND LEFT OFFICE. THERE WAS A RECENT SURVEY DONE OF BOTH WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND THEY SAID, WHEN WAS THE BEST OR YOU CAN -- BEST IN YEAR YOU CAN REMEMBER? AND THEY SAID, 2000. WHY WAS THAT? BECAUSE WE WERE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. BUT THE REPUBLICANS CAME BACK WITH THEIR FAILED POSITION. TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS. AND THEN OF COURSE THEY TOOK THEIR EYES OFF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE MORTGAGE MARKETS AND WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. THIS IS NOT ANCIENT HISTORY. AND I REMIND US OF IT BECAUSE THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO RUN THE SAME CAMPAIGN. THEY ARE GOING TO RUN THE SAME ECONOMIC POLICIES. YOU CAN ALREADY SEE IT. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. WE WERE LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS ELECTED AND I WILL TELL YOU, I DO NOT THINK HE GETS THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR MAKING SURE WE DID NOT FALL INTO A GREAT DEPRESSION.   AND, YOU KNOW WHAT THE REPUBLICANS ALL SAY, THEY SAID IT IN THEIR DEBATES, YOU'LL HEAR FROM THEIR PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE, THEY WILL SAY, WHILE THIS IS THE SLOWEST RECOVERY IN HISTORY. NOW MY FRIENDS, THAT TAKES A LOT OF NERVE. WE WOULD NOT HAVE NEEDED A RECOVERY OF THE REPUBLICANS HAD NOT DRIVEN US OFF THE CLIFF IN THE FIRST PLACE.   SO HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO DO. I HAVE A PROGRAM TO CREATE MORE GOOD JOBS WITH RISING INCOMES. REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE ARE GOING TO INVEST IN MORE INFRASTRUCTURE. ROADS, BRIDGES, TUNNELS, PORTS, AIRPORTS. I THINK IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT A BRIDGE YOU HAVE GOT RIGHT HERE SHOULD BE FIXED. THESE ARE GOOD JOBS. THESE PAY GOOD MONEY. BUT THEY ALSO MAKE US MORE COMPETITIVE. WHY SHOULD WE ALLOW ALL OF THESE INVESTMENTS THAT OUR PARENTS, OUR GRANDPARENTS, OUR GREAT-GRANDPARENTS MADE, GO TO WASTE? IT MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. LET'S PUT AMERICA TO WORK. THESE ARE JOBS YOU CANNOT EXPORT. THEY HAVE GOT TO BE DONE RIGHT HERE IN KENTUCKY. AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO BRING ADVANCED MANUFACTURING. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SAY TO ME, WE CANNOT DO THAT. I DO NOT BUY THAT. I BELIEVE WE CAN MAKE IT AN AMERICA AGAIN. WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A PLAN. WE HAVE GOT TO INVEST IN TAX INCENTIVES FOR COUNTRIES  W3  THAT --  W3  FOR  W3  COMPANIES  W3  THAT  W3  WILL  W3  ACTUALLY  W3  PRODUCE  W3  MANUFACTURING  W3  JOBS  W3  HERE  W3  INSTEAD  W3  OF  W3  SHIPPING  W3  THOSE  W3  JOBS  W3 	OVERSEAS.    W3  MRS.  W3  CLINTON:  W3  BUT  W3  THERE  W3  ARE  W3  A  W3  LOT  W3  OF  W3  THINGS  W3  WE  W3  HAVE  W3  GOT  W3  TO  W3  INVENT  W3  AND  W3  BUILD  W3 AND  W3 WE  W3  SHOULD  W3  DO  W3  IT  W3  HERE  W3  IN  W3  AMERICA.

W3 MY  W3 DAD  W3 WAS  W3 A  W3 SMALL  W3 BUSINESSMAN  W3 AND  W3 I  W3 LOVE  W3 SMALL  W3 BUSINESSES  W3 BECAUSE  W3 YOU  W3 NEVER  W3 KNOW  W3 WHAT  W3 CAN  W3 BE  W3 MADE  W3 FROM  W3 A  W3 SMALL  W3 BUSINESS  W3 AND  W3 I  W3 WANT  W3 TO  W3 DO  W3 MORE  W3 TO  W3 HELP  W3 YOU  W3 GET  W3 AHEAD  W3 IF  W3 YOU  W3 HAVE  W3 A  W3 SMALL  W3 BUSINESS.  W3 AND  W3 I  W3 DO  W3 BELIEVE  W3 WE  W3 SHOULD  W3 RAISE  W3 THE  W3 FEDERAL  W3 MINIMUM  W3 WAGE.  W3 NOW,  W3 I  W3 GOT  W3 TO  W3 TELL  W3 YOU  W3 IT  W3 IS  W3 REALLY  W3 PAINFUL  W3 WHEN  W3 YOU  W3 LOOK  W3 AT  W3 PEOPLE  W3 WHO  W3 ARE  W3 WORKING  W3 HARD  W3 FULL-TIME  W3 AND  W3 THEY  W3 ARE  W3 STILL  W3 IN  W3 POVERTY.  W3 I  W3 MEAN,  W3 YOU  W3 SHOULD  W3 FEEL  W3 LIKE  W3 YOU  W3 HAVE  W3 GOT  W3 A  W3 LADDER  W3 OF  W3 OPPORTUNITY  W3 UP  W3 IF  W3 YOU'RE  W3 DOING  W3 WHAT  W3 WE  W3 WANT  W3 YOU  W3 AND  W3 EXPECT  W3 YOU  W3 TO  W3 DO.  W3 TWO  W3 THIRDS  W3 OF  W3 MINIMUM  W3 WAGE  W3 WORKERS  W3 ARE  W3 WOMEN.     W3 A  W3 LOT  W3 OF  W3 THEM  W3 SINGLE-PARENT  W3 SUPPORTING  W3 THEIR  W3 CHILDREN.  W3 I  W3 WANT  W3 TO  W3 RAISE  W3 THE  W3 FEDERAL  W3 MINIMUM  W3 WAGE.  W3 IF  W3 STATES  W3 WANT  W3 TO  W3 GO  W3 ABOVE  W3 IT,  W3 THAT  W3 IS  W3 THEIR  W3 BUSINESS.  W3 BUT  W3 WE  W3 HAVE  W3 GOT  W3 TO  W3 GET  W3 THE  W3 FLOOR  W3 UP  W3 SO  W3 THAT  W3 PEOPLE  W3 HAVE  W3 A  W3 CHANCE  W3 TO  W3 MAKE  W3 IT  W3 IN  W3 AMERICA  W3 BY  W3 THE  W3 DEBT  W3 OF  W3 THEIR  W3 HARD  W3 WORK.  W3 AND  W3 I  W3 TELL  W3 YOU,  W3 IT  W3 IS  W3 WAY  W3 PAST  W3 TIME  W3 TO  W3 GUARANTEE  W3 EQUAL  W3 PAY  W3 FOR  W3 WOMEN'S  W3 WORK.    W3 MRS.  W3 CLINTON:  W3 THIS  W3 IS  W3 NOT  W3 JUST  W3 A  W3 WOMEN'S  W3 ISSUE,  W3 THIS  W3 IS  W3 A  W3 FAMILY  W3 ISSUE.  W3 IF  W3 YOU  W3 HAVE  W3 A  W3 MOTHER,  W3 A  W3 WIFE,  W3 A  W3 DAUGHTER,  W3 A  W3 SISTER  W3 WHO  W3 IS  W3 SHORTCHANGED,  W3 YOU  W3 ARE  W3 BEING  W3 SHORTCHANGED.  W3 AND  W3 IT  W3 IS  W3 NOT  W3 ONLY  W3 THE  W3 FAMILY  W3 INCOME  W3 BEING  W3 SHORTCHANGED,  W3 THE  W3 WOMAN  W3 WHO  W3 IS  W3 GETTING  W3 LESS  W3 THAN  W3 WHAT  W3 HER  W3 PAY  W3 SHOULD  W3 BE  W3 IS  W3 GETTING  W3 SHORTCHANGED  W3 IN  W3 RETIREMENT.  W3 GETTING  W3 SHORTCHANGED  W3 AND  W3 SOCIAL  W3 SECURITY.  W3 IT  W3 IS  W3 NOT  W3 JUST  W3 A  W3 ONE  W3 DAY,  W3 ONE  W3 WEEK,  W3 ONE  W3 PAY,  W3 ONE  W3 YEAR  W3 PHENOMENON.  W3 AND  W3 I  W3 DO  W3 NOT  W3 KNOW  W3 ABOUT  W3 YOU  W3 BUT  W3 I  W3 CAN  W3 TELL  W3 YOU --    WELL, I COULD TELL YOU THAT AS A WOMAN WHO HAS SHOPPED MOST OF HER LIFE, I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN A DISCOUNT WHEN I GOT TO THE CASHIER. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANYONE SAY, YOU ARE A WOMAN SO YOU ONLY HAVE TO PAY $.78 ON THE DOLLAR. OR AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN, YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY $.68. OR LATINA WOMAN, $.58. THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED YET STOP -- THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED YET. BUT WE HAVE TO BE FAIR AND PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD NEED TO BE REWARDED. THAT IS HOW WE BUILD THIS COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE IN HARD WORK AND OPPORTUNITY. I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE, I STARTED OUT IN LEXINGTON TODAY AND --    -- AND I WAS TALKING TO SOME YOUNG PARENTS, MOMS AND DADS. I HAD A CONVERSATION LIKE THAT IN VIRGINIA YESTERDAY. WE ARE MAKING IT SO DIFFICULT FOR YOUNG FAMILIES. THE STRESSES ON YOUNG FAMILIES TODAY SEEM TO BE MUCH GREATER IN LOTS OF WAYS BECAUSE BETWEEN THE FACT THAT YOU ARE NOT GETTING RAISES LIKE PEOPLE USED TO EXPECT AND YOU ARE NOT GETTING EQUAL PAY FOR YOUR WORK AND CHILDCARE CAN COST AS MUCH AS SENDING A CHILD TO A UNIVERSITY AND YOU GOT ALL KINDS OF CHALLENGES IF YOU HAVE A NEW BABY OR A SICK SPOUSE OR A SICK PARENT, YOU CANNOT GET TIME OFF. WE ARE REALLY MAKING IT HARD AND I THINK IT IS TIME TO BRING FAMILY POLICY INTO THE 21ST CENTURY. IT IS NOT THE WAY IT USED TO BE. WE HAVE GOT TO SUPPORT THESE YOUNG PARENTS. I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS WORK MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE. FIRST JOB I HAD OUT OF LAW SCHOOL WAS WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. AND I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE GIVE PEOPLE HOPE. THAT WE GIVE PEOPLE A REAL SENSE THAT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND THAT THEY DO NOT FEEL LIKE GAME IS RIGGED AGAINST THEM AND THE DECK IS STACKED. SO I'M GOING TO KEEP ADVOCATING FOR GOOD JOBS, RISING INCOME, INTO GOOD WORK-FAMILY BALANCE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN DEAL LIKE THEY ARE BEING THERE TO THEIR FAMILY WHILE THEY DO THEIR WORK IN THEIR WORKPLACE. EVERY TIME I ADVOCATE FOR THIS, YOU KNOW, THE REPUBLICANS ALL SAY -- THERE SHE GOES. PLAYING THE WOMEN'S CARD. AND I ALWAYS SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT -- IF TALKING ABOUT EQUAL PAY AND WOMEN'S HEALTH AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE IS PLAYING THE WOMEN'S CARD, THEN DEAL ME IN!  MRS. CLINTON:  YOU ARE A GREAT CROWD TODAY.   OK, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE? WE HAVE GOT TO DO MORE ON EDUCATION AND WE HAVE TO START AT THE BEGINNING AND GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH. WE NEED EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SO EVERY KID IS PREPARED AND WE NEED TO WORK WITH OUR TEACHERS. LIKE THE ONE WHO IS OUT HERE EARLIER TODAY INTRODUCING ALLISON. WE NEED TO BE SUPPORTING OUR TEACHERS NOT SCAPEGOATING OUR TEACHERS. GIVING THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOBS. AND I HAVE A PLAN FOR DEBT-FREE COLLEGE. IF YOU GO TO A PUBLIC COLLEGE. AND THE REASON WE CAN AFFORD TO DO THIS IS BECAUSE WE CAN INVEST IN THE EDUCATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE FROM MIDDLE-CLASS WORKING POOR FAMILIES. NOT THE WEALTHY. I DO NOT BELIEVE IN FREE COLLEGE FOR THE WEALTHY. I DO NOT SUPPORT THAT. MY OPPONENT, SENATOR SANDERS, DOES. WE JUST HAVE A DIFFERENCE. BUT HE ALSO REQUIRES THAT ONE THIRD OF THE COST FOR FREE COLLEGE BE PAID BY THE STATE. I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I DO NOT THINK YOUR NEW GOVERNOR IS VERY FRIENDLY TO HIGHER EDUCATION.   --  SENATOR -- SO MY PLAN AVOIDS THAT, AND WE FUND IT DIRECTLY. ANOTHER THING WE ARE GOING TO DO IS PAY DOWN STUDENT DEBT BY LETTING YOU REFINANCE YOUR STUDENT DEBT LIKE A MORTGAGE OR A CAR PAYMENT. I AM EXCITED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH STUDENT DEBT OUT THERE AND IT IS HOLDING PEOPLE BACK AND HOLDING THEM DOWN. $1.2 TRILLION IN STUDENT DEBT. LET'S GET THE STUDENT INTEREST RATE DOWN. LET'S GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE TO PAY BACK AS A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME. LET US PUT A DATE CERTAIN WHEN IT ENDS AND LET'S KEEP THAT GOVERNMENT FROM MAKING MONEY BY LENDING MONEY TO STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES.   NOW, I ALSO WILL TELL YOU I WILL DEFEND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND I AM SADDENED TO BUY WHAT I HEAR MAY OUT OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN KENTUCKY.   I AM ESPECIALLY SADDENED BECAUSE I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THIS, BUT KENTUCKY UNDER GOVERNOR BASHEAR WAS WIDELY PRAISED FOR RUNNING THE BEST AFFORDABLE CARE TRANSITION IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY. YOUR STATE EXCHANGE CALLED ""CONNECT"" WAS BIGGER,RICHER. YOU GUYS DID IT RIGHT AND IT IS WORKING. YOU HAD THE SECOND-BIGGEST DROP IN THE UNINSURED AND THE COUNTRY, NEARLY 9% IT IS DOWN TO. AND I WAS VISITING THE FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS HERE IN LOUISVILLE AND TALKING TO DOCTORS AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PATIENTS AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, IT BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES. PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING HEALTH CARE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS. PEOPLE DEALING WITH PROBLEMS THAT THEY HAD TO IGNORE. PEOPLE FEEL HEALTHIER, MORE PRODUCTIVE, LIKE THEY CAN PUT IN A GOOD DAY'S WORK BECAUSE THEY NOW HAVE THE TREATMEANT THEY DESERVE AND NEED TO HAVE. AND IT IS SO DISTRESSING TO ME WHEN ANYBODY IN PUBLIC LIFE WHO HAS ALL THE HEALTH CARE HE OR SHE NEEDS WANTS TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM POOR PEOPLE, WORKING POOR PEOPLE, SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE, AND OTHERS WHO DO NOT HAVE THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED.   I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT. I REALLY DO BELIEVE WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. HOW DOES IT HELP ME OR HELP OUR ECONOMY IF YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THIS STATE WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED? THAT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE A PRODUCTIVE OUTCOME AT ALL. SO I AM HOPING MAYBE YOU'RE GOVERNOR WILL COME OUT WITH A PLAN THAT DOES NOT STRIP AWAY THE HEALTH INSURANCE THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF KENTUCKIANS NOW HAVE. I SURE HOPE THAT IS THE CASE BECAUSE THAT IS THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE SHOULD BE STRIVING TO BE. WHERE WE DO TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER.   AND THERE ARE TWO ISSUES, I WANT TO GET THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DOWN AND I THINK WE CAN DO IT NOW. AND I WANT TO DO MORE ON MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION.  MRS. CLINTON:  BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES, WE ARE JUST NOT DOING ENOUGH. THERE IS STILL TOO MUCH STIGMA ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH, RIGHT? IF YOU HAVE DIABETES, YOU TELL YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS YOU HAVE DIAGNOSED WITH THAT, RIGHT? IF YOU HAVE DEPRESSION, YOU'RE NOT SURE YOU WANT THEM TO KNOW. AND YOU MAY NOT EVEN GO GET THE HELP YOU NEED BECAUSE YOU ARE EMBARRASSED. IT IS TIME TO END THE STIGMA. WE ARE LEARNING SO MUCH ABOUT THE BODY, ABOUT OUR GENOMES, ABOUT HOW WE WORK. AND WE ARE ALL ONE BODY. WHETHER IT IS MENTAL HEALTH OR PHYSICAL HEALTH, NEED TO DO MORE TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING.   AND I KNOW KENTUCKY IS FACING A BIG OPIOID CRISIS. AND WE HAVE GOT TO DO MORE BECAUSE WE ARE LOSING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE A YEAR TO OVERDOSES AND I WAS VERY PLEASED TO SEE FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS TODAY TO LEARN THEY ARE STARTING OPIOID TREATMENT BUT WE NEED THAT EVERYWHERE BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED HELP AND THEY NEED TO BE SAVED FROM OVERDOSES. A LOT OF THEM DO NOT KNOW THEY ARE OVERDOSING. MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE LOST CHILDREN OF DEAR FRIENDS OF OURS. ADULT CHILDREN. WHO HAD NO INTENTION TO DIE, BUT THEY TOOK A PILL AFTER THEY HAD A BEER OR TWO. AND THEY NEVER WOKE UP. THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST HEARTBREAKING STORY I HEAR AS I TRAVEL ACROSS AMERICA AND AS YOUR PRESIDENT I ASSURE YOU WE ARE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SAVE LIVES. DIVERT PEOPLE FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. GIVE THEM TREATMENT. HELP THEM INTO RECOVERY AND LET THEM GET ON A BETTER TRACK. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO REFORM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND AND THE ERA OF MASS INCARCERATION WITH MORE DIVERSIONS AND MORE SECOND CHANCE PROGRAMS. I THINK IT IS ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES AND I WANT US TO LEAD THE WAY AT THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVELS SUPPORTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. YOU KNOW, THERE IS A LOT OF GREAT WORK FOR US TO DO IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW AND I THINK EVERYBODY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE TO MEET THE TEST OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE TELLING YOU ABOUT HOW THEY ARE GOING TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF AMERICANS. WHAT ARE THE POSITIVE RESULTS THAT WE ARE SEEKING? I ALSO THINK THEY SHOULD LEVEL WITH YOU ABOUT WHERE THEY STAND ON ALL OF THE HOT BUTTON ISSUES. THE ISSUES ABOUT RIGHTS. BECAUSE THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US. I WILL DEFEND A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN HEALTH CARE DECISIONS.   AND I WILL DEFEND MARRIAGE EQUALITY. AND I WILL DEFEND VOTING RIGHTS. AND I WILL WORK TO END CITIZENS UNITED AND I WILL WORK TO RID OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM OF UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY. I TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT IN THIS CAMPAIGN. I TAKE IT PERSONALLY THAT CITIZENS UNITED CASE WAS ANOTHER RIGHT WING ATTACK ON ME. THE RIGHT WING NEVER GIVES UP ON ATTACKING ME, HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT? HONEST TO GOODNESS, I THINK THEY ARE REALLY GOING TO THROW AND EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE KITCHEN SINK THIS TIME. BUT I HAVE A LITTLE MESSAGE FOR THEM. THEY HAVE DONE IT FOR 25 YEARS AND I AM STILL STANDING.     IT IS ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU GO TO VOTE ON TUESDAY TO REMEMBER YOUR VOTING NOT JUST FOR PRESIDENT BUT FOR A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. AND THE HIGHEST OBLIGATION OF A PRESIDENT IS TO PROTECT AMERICA. I TAKE THAT AS A SOLEMN OBLIGATION AND IT IS WHY I HAVE BEEN SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE RECKLESS TALK COMING FROM DONALD TRUMP. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, IT IS A LONG LIST NOW THAT HE JUST SORT OF THROWS THINGS OUT AND PEOPLE SAY, MAYBE HE DOES NOT REALLY MEAN IT. WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING FOR AND SERVING AS PRESIDENT, YOU HAD BETTER MEAN WHAT YOU SAY. SO WHEN HE CASUALLY SAYS HE DOES NOT CARE IF MORE COUNTRIES GET NUCLEAR WEAPONS, I SHUDDER. THE LAST THING WE NEED ARE MORE COUNTRIES WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS, I AM TRYING TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THAT IS WHY NEGOTIATED A TREATY WITH RUSSIA TO DO JUST THAT. WE DO NOT NEED MORE COUNTRIES, WE NEED FEWER COUNTRIES WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS. WHEN HE SAYS HE WANTS TO WITHDRAW FROM NATO, THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MILITARY ALLIANCE IN HISTORY, I SAY -- WHAT ARE WE GOING TO SUBSTITUTE FOR IT AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO WORK WITH OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES AGAINST ALL OF THE THREATS WE FACE? AND WHEN HE SAYS, LET THE IRANIANS OR RUSSIANS GO AFTER ISIS, WELL, HELLO, THE LAST THING WE NEED IS IRAN TAKING OVER SYRIA, TAKING OVER LEBANON, AND THREATENING ISRAEL AND EUROPE AND EVERYBODY ELSE. SO I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU, IF I AM SO FORTUNATE TO BE THE NOMINEE I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO DEBATING DONALD TRUMP COME THE FALL.   AND YOU KNOW, FINALLY, WE HAVE GOT TO UNIFY AMERICA. I MEAN, A HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF, AS ABRAHAM LINCOLN SAID, CANNOT STAND. WE CANNOT BE SCAPEGOATING, FINGER-POINTING, BLAMING, AND DEMEANING AND DEGRADING AND INSULTING OUR FELLOW AMERICANS. DO WE HAVE DISAGREEMENTS? YES. THAT IS IN OUR DNA. THAT IS HEALTHY. THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS AND WE HAVE A GOOD BACK AND FORTH ABOUT HOW WE ACHIEVE THEM. YOU DO NOT DO THAT BY DENIGRATING PEOPLE. DEMEANING PEOPLE. THAT IS NOT WHAT WE ARE. AND IT IS TIME WE SAID ""ENOUGH."" WE ARE WILLING TO HAVE GOOD POLITICAL DEBATES BUT ENOUGH WITH THE HATE RHETORIC AND THE INSULTS.   LET'S LOOK FOR WAYS THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. LET'S RECOGNIZE WHAT DID MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT. BECAUSE YOU SEE, I THINK WE ARE GREAT. BUT I THINK WE CAN BE GREATER IF WE DO WHAT WE MUST DO. AND SO MANY OF THE TARGETS THAT DONALD TRUMP AND SO MANY OF THE OTHER REPUBLICANS AIM AT, IT IS PART OF HOW WE BECAME GREAT. THIS EFFORT TO UNDERMINE WORKER RIGHTS AND UNION RIGHTS IS UNDERMINING THE MIDDLE CLASS. UNDERMINING THE CORE OF WHO WE ARE AND HOW OUR ECONOMY OPERATES AND HOW WE CAN GET STRONGER AND MORE PROSPEROUS. ATTACKING IMMIGRANTS? WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS, RIGHT! ATTACKING MUSLIMS? WELL, MUSLIMS HAVE TO BE ON THE FRONTLINES TO PROTECT US AGAINST TERRORISTS. THEY HAVE GOT TO TELL US WHAT THEY HEAR AND WHAT THEY SEE. THAT IS WHAT WE LEARNED IN NEW YORK AFTER 9/11. I HAVE LIVED THIS. AND ONE OF THE WAYS WE PICKED UP INFORMATION WAS BY MAKING SURE THAT AMERICAN MUSLIMS UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY WERE WELCOME TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND TO CALL THE POLICE AND TO REPORT WHAT THEY SAW AND WHAT THEY HEARD. IT HELPED TO KEEP US SAFE AND IT WILL AGAIN. THAT IS WHY WE CANNOT BE DIVIDING OURSELVES. WE NEED TO BE UNITED AGAINST TERRORISM.   AND DEMEANING AND DENIGRATING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES? THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. INSULTING WOMEN? I DON'T CARE WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT ME BUT I DO RESENT WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE. OTHER SUCCESSFUL WOMEN. WOMEN WHO HAVE WORKED HARD. WOMEN WHO HAVE DONE THEIR PART. WE ARE, AFTER ALL, 51% OF THE COUNTRY.   I HAVE NEVER SEEN US HAVE SUCH A DIVISIVE CAMPAIGN AND I AM GOING TO DO MY BEST TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE ISSUES ARE. WHAT I SEE AS OUR FUTURE. THE KIND OF POSITIVE VISION I HAVE FOR AMERICA. I AM GOING TO BUILD ON THE GOOD WORK THAT HAS GONE BEFORE. I AM GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. I WILL GO ANYWHERE, ANYTIME, MEET WITH ANYONE TO FIND COMMON GROUND. ABSOLUTELY.   THAT IS WHAT I DID AS FIRST LADY, THAT IS WHAT I DID AS A SENATOR, THAT IS WHAT I DID AS SECRETARY OF STATE.   I AM ALL ABOUT GETTING RESULTS FOR AMERICA. THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS, ARE PEOPLE GOING TO BE BETTER OFF WHEN I AND THEY HUNG WHEN I STARTED? -- ARE PEOPLE GOING TO BE BETTER OFF WHEN I END THAN WHEN I STARTED? ARE MORE FAMILIES GOING TO HAVE BETTER JOBS WITH RISING INCOMES? ARE MORE KIDS GOING TO HAVE BETTER EDUCATIONS AND BETTER HEALTH CARE RESTAURANT ARE WE GOING TO COME TOGETHER AS A NATION AND THAT OF FALLING APART? I THINK THAT IS OUR BIG CHALLENGE OF THE 21ST CENTURY BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU, THERE THERE IS NO OTHER COUNTRY, NONE. I WENT TO 112 COUNTRIES AS YOUR SECRETARY OF STATE FOR YOU. THERE IS NO OTHER COUNTRY THAT HOLDS A CANDLE TO US WHEN WE ARE GOOD, NOBODY IS BETTER. I WANT US TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND GET TO WORK. AND I FEEL ESPECIALLY STRONGLY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I HAVE A GRANDDAUGHTER NOW AND THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE GRANDCHILDREN, YOU KNOW. YOU ARE JUST OBSESSED WITH THEM. IT IS REALLY KIND OF WEIRD. YOU JUST SIT THERE AND STARE AT THEM. AND YOU DO IT BECAUSE YOU ARE SO OVERWHELMED BY LOVE AND YOU SEE YOUR CHILD OR YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER, WHO IS NOW A PARENT. BUT IT IS ALSO BECAUSE YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE AND AND YOU ARE SAYING TO YOURSELF, I DON'T WANT ANYTHING EVER TO GO WRONG FOR THIS PRECIOUS CHILD. I DO NOT WANT HER TO EVER FACE HARD TIMES. ALTHOUGH THEY COME IN EVERYONE'S LIFE. BUT YOU SEE, IT IS NOT ENOUGH THAT MY GRANDCHILD HAS OPPORTUNITIES. I WANT EVERY CHILD AND EVERY GRANDCHILD HERE IN THIS CITY, THIS STATE, I WANT EVERY CHILD TO HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO GROW UP AND FULFILL HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. THAT IS WHAT I WILL WORK ON EVERY SINGLE DAY AND THIS CAMPAIGN AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE. PLEASE COME OUT AND VOTE ON TUESDAY. THANK YOU!

I HAVE MET WITH COAL FAMILIES WHO WANT TO BE BANK, AS THEY SHOULD BE, FOR THE WORK THAT THEY AND THEIR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS DID TO BUILD THIS COUNTRY. WORKERS DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW CHINA GETS AWAY WITH UNDERCUTTING OUR JOB AND BUSINESSES. I MET WITH RAILROADERS WHO WATCHED AS THE DECLINE OF COAL AND STEEL IN THIS REGION HAS LED TO CARDS IN RAIL SERVICE WHICH COSTS JOBS NOW AND WILL CUT THE REGION OFF FROM MORE JOBS LATER. TO EVERYONE WHO TOOK THE TIME TO TELL ME ABOUT THEIR LIVES, BOTH THE GOOD AND BAD, I AM REALLY GRATEFUL AND THANK YOU. I WILL NOT FORGET THAT GENEROSITY. THANKS TO YOU I HAVE LEARNED A LOT WHICH IS WHAT I CAME HERE TO DO. WE STARTED IN KENTUCKY WHERE I MET WITH DOZENS OF STEEL WORKERS WHO WERE LAID OFF WHEN THE FACTORY WHERE THEY WORKED FOR DECADES WAS IDLED. AND THEN WE DROVE TO WEST VIRGINIA, A TOWN DEEP IN THE COAL FIELD WHERE THE COMMUNITY IS WORKING HARD TO BUILD A MORE DIVERSE ECONOMY AFTER LOSING HUNDREDS OF JOBS. TODSAYAY, WE HAD A CONVERSATION IN CHARLESTON, WEST VIRGINIA THAT WAS BOTH SORROWFUL AND INSPIRING, WITH PEOPLE IN RECOVERY FOR ADDICTION AND THE DOCTORS, THE COUNSELORS, THE POLICE OFFICERS, RECOVERING ADDICTS AND OTHERS WHO ARE HELPING THEM GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. I'M ENDING MY TRIP HERE IN ATHENS BECAUSE SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE JACKIE O.'S ARE WHAT MAKE THIS SUCH A DYNAMIC COMMUNITY AND WE NEED MORE OF THAT.  IT SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE SAID, BUT I WILL SAY IT, APPALACHIA IS A VITAL PART OF THE UNITED STATES.  ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY AND PEOPLE ACROSS THIS REASON ARE VITAL TO AMERICA'S FUTURE AND I KNOW THAT TOO OFTEN PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY ARE NOT TREATED THAT WAY. YOU SHOULD BE. IT IS HOME TO SOME OF THE MOST RESILIENT, HARD-WORKING PEOPLE ANYWHERE ON THIS PLANET. YOU DESERVE EVERY CHANCE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD IN AMERICA. OUR COUNTRY SUCCEEDS ONLY WHEN WORKING PEOPLE EVERYWHERE CAN SUCCEED, NOT JUST IN BIG CITIES, BUT IN THE HILLS OF EASTERN KENTUCKY, RIGHT HERE IN SOUTHERN OHIO, DEEP IN THE COAL FIELDS OF WEST VIRGINIA, THE SMALL TOWNS THAT DOT THIS PART OF AMERICA. WE NEED TO BREAK DOWN ALL OF THE BARRIERS HOLDING PEOPLE BACK. NOT JUST HERE, BUT ACROSS AMERICA. SO EVERYONE CAN SHARE IN THE PROMISE OF OUR COUNTRY. FAMILIES HERE LIKE FAMILIES EVERYWHERE WANT THE SAME THING. GOOD JOBS OF THE PAY ENOUGH TO PROVIDE A MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE, GOOD SCHOOLS FOR KIDS AND OPPORTUNITIES WHEN THEY GRADUATE. SAFE AND WELCOMING COMMUNITIES TO GROW UP IN AN GROW OLD IN. SOMETHING LESS TANGIBLE, BUT JUST AS ESSENTIAL, FAITH IN THE FUTURE AND CONFIDENCE THAT YOUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS WILL HAVE ALL THE CHOICES AND OPPORTUNITIES THEY DESERVE. THAT SHOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH TO ASK, ESPECIALLY FOR A PLACE THAT HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR AMERICA. FOR GENERATIONS, APPALACHIAN COAL BUT THE LIGHTS ON IN PEOPLE'S HOMES AND SCHOOLS, KEPT ASSEMBLY LINES ROLLING IN FACTORIES. STEEL GLANCE HELPED BUILD OUR SKYSCRAPERS AND WIN WORLD WAR II. APPELLATION CHEMICAL PLANTS MAKE THE PRODUCTS OF THAT SHAPE MODERN LIFE. THESE WERE TOUGH JOBS, BUT THEY PROVIDED A TICKET TO THE CLASS. IT WAS NOT AN EASY RIDE. MORE THAN 100,000 -- LET ME REPEAT THAT -- MORE THAN 100,000 MINERS DIED ON THE JOB IN THE 20TH CENTURY IN AMERICA. MORE THAN TWICE THAT MANY SUCCUMBED TO BLACK LUNG DISEASE. THE UNITED MINE WORKERS PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE IN PLACES LIKE HARLAN COUNTY AND BLAIR MOUNTAIN TO SECURE THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE, BARGAIN, AND PROTECT THE WELL-BEING OF MINERS ON THE JOB AND IN RETIREMENT. THEIR VICTORIES HELPED STRENGTHEN THE LABOR MOVEMENT NATIONWIDE. COUNTLESS WORKERS, NOT JUST THOSE IN UNIONS, BUT COUNTLESS WORKERS HAVE BENEFITED IN ALL KINDS OF INDUSTRIES. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THE WORKERS OF APPALACHIA MADE AMERICA MORE PROSPEROUS AND SECURE. THAT LEGACY SHOULD BE HONORED, NOT ONLY AS A RICH CHAPTER IN OUR HISTORY, BUT AS A DEBT. WE ALWAYS MUST STRIVE TO REPAY. I KNOW THAT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS REGION, THESE WORDS MAY SOUND NICE, BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO BELIEVE THEM. YOU HAVE HAD A LOT OF POLITICIANS MAKE A LOT OF PROMISES TO YOU OVER THE YEARS THAT THEY COULD NOT KEEP. I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT, BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU THIS -- IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF SERVING AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY EVERY DAY WITH A YOU VOTE FOR ME OR NOT. I WILL BE YOUR PARTNER.   I WILL BE YOUR PARTNER, AND I WILL NOT, FOR ONE MINUTE, GIVE UP ON APPALACHIA. NOT YOUR CHILDREN OR YOUR COMMUNITIES. SOME OF YOU MAY BE WONDERING, HOW CAN I SAY ALL THIS? HERE IN OHIO, A FEW WEEKS AGO DURING THE PRIMARY, IT SOUNDED LIKE I SAID SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY ABOUT COAL MINER JOBS. TO PUT IT PLAINLY, I MISSPOKE.  THE ENERGY MARKET IS CHANGING HERE IN AMERICA AND AROUND THE WORLD, BUT COAL IS STILL PART OF OUR ENERGY SUPPLY. ALTHOUGH IT PRODUCES FAR LESS OF OUR ELECTRICITY THAN IT ONCE DID. EVEN CHINA IS STARTING TO BURN LESS COAL, THAT IS GOOD FOR THE PLANET, BUT IT HAS HURT AMERICAN COAL EXPORTS FROM THIS REGION. AND NO MATTER WHAT SOME POLITICIANS TELL YOU, THESE TRENDS ARE HERE TO STAY. YOU'VE GOT SOLAR PANELS, DON'T YOU? ON TOP OF THIS BREWERY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO GO BACK TO AN ENERGY SYSTEM THAT LOOKS LIKE IT DID IN THE 20TH CENTURY. WE KNOW WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND FUTURES BY COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE AND ACCELERATING THE TRANSITION TO A CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY.   BUT THAT IS STILL A TRANSITION. ANYONE WHO PRETENDS WE CAN FLIP A SWITCH AND BE IN THE CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE TOMORROW IS NOT BEING HONEST WITH YOU, EITHER. WE NEED TO TRY EVERYTHING WE CAN TO CUT CARBON POLLUTION. THAT INCLUDES SUPPORTING CUTTING EDGE WORK BEING DONE RIGHT HERE IN APPALACHIA, IN INSTITUTIONS, WORKING ON CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION TECHNOLOGY. THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT TO TAKE ANY POSSIBLE SOLUTION OFF THE TABLE. I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO GO AROUND THE COUNTRY TALKING ABOUT THE CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY, WHICH I HAVE DONE FOR MORE THAN A YEAR, THEN WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO COME TO THIS REGION OF OUR COUNTRY AND LOOK PEOPLE IN THE EYE AND TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS FOR YOUR LIVES AND LIVELIHOOD. THE IMPACT ON APPALACHIA IS COMPOUNDED BY OTHER ECONOMIC CHALLENGES. THE CHINESE ARE DUMPING CHEAP STEEL IN OUR MARKETS, TRYING TO FIX THEIR PROBLEMS ON THE BACKS OF AMERICAN WORKERS. A LOT OF FAMILIES STILL HAVE NOT RECOVERED FROM THE GREAT RECESSION, WHICH WIPED OUT JOBS, HOMES, AND SAVINGS. YESTERDAY I MET A MAN NAMED BEAU IN WEST VIRGINIA. HE WAS A MAINTENANCE PLANNER. HE LOST HIS JOB LAST FALL. HE SHOWED ME A PICTURE OF HIS THREE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE CHILDREN, A SON AND TWO DAUGHTERS, AND SAID HE WAS TRYING TO KEEP ON A BRAVE FACE FOR THEM SO THEY WOULD NOT KNOW HOW WORRIED HE AND HIS WIFE ARE. WEST VIRGINIANS ARE PROUD PEOPLE, BEAU SAID. WE TAKE PRIDE IN OUR FAITH IN GOD, WE TAKE PRIDE IN OUR FAMILY, WE TAKE PRIDE IN OUR JOBS. WE TAKE PRIDE IN THE FACTS THAT WE ARE HARD WORKERS. SO WHY, HE ASKED, ARE THERE NOT MORE PROGRAMS IN PLACE ALREADY TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE HIM? WHY ISN'T THERE MORE HELP TO TURN TO? HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET NEW JOBS THERE, NOT YEARS FROM NOW BUT RIGHT NOW? I WILL BET EVERYBODY IN HERE KNOWS SOMEBODY IN THE SAME BOAT. AND BEAU WAS CLEAR, HE IS A REPUBLICAN, HE IS NOT VOTING FOR ME. BUT I REALLY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THAT. WE NEED TO DO BETTER FOR BEAU AND HIS FAMILY AND FAMILIES LIKE HIS ACROSS APPALACHIA AND AMERICA, AND THAT MEANS --   THAT MEANS COMING TOGETHER, MAKING A REAL PLAN TO INVEST IN THE FOUNDATIONS OF A STRONG MIDDLE CLASS, NAMELY, GOOD JOBS AND QUALITY EDUCATION FOR OUR KIDS. AND A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR AMERICAN WORKERS. THAT IS WHAT MY PLAN FOR REVITALIZING COMMUNITIES HERE WILL DO. FIRST, WE HAVE TO HONOR OUR OBLIGATIONS TO MINERS PAST AND PRESENT AND STAND WITH THE STEEL WORKERS WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVELIHOODS RIGHT NOW.   FOR MONTHS, I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THE COAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE TRIED TO SHIRK THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO WORKERS AND RETIREES. POWER PLANT WORKERS, MINERS, AND RAILROAD EMPLOYEES EARNED THE BENEFITS AND THE RESPECT OF ALL AMERICANS.   AND AMONG THE 100,000 MINERS WHO HAVE DIED IN THE LAST CENTURY, WE HAVE LOST MINERS IN THIS CENTURY TOO WHO ARE JOINED WITH THEM IN SACRIFICE. THE 29 GREAT MEN WHO PERISHED AT THE UPPER BIG BRANCH MINE. THE OWNER OF THAT MINE, DON BLANKENSHIP, HAD NEGLECTED WORKER SAFETY FOR YEARS. BECAUSE OF WEAK LAWS, WHEN HE WAS FINALLY CAUGHT, FINALLY CHARGED AND FINALLY CONVICTED, HE ONLY RECEIVED A ONE-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE. ONE YEAR FOR 29 DEATHS. THAT IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN THOSE LAWS AND HOLD EXECUTIVES WHO NEGLECT WORKERS' HEALTH AND SAFETY TO ACCOUNT. THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT TWO BILLS IN FRONT OF CONGRESS RIGHT NOW, THE MINERS PROTECTION ACT AND THE MINE SAFETY PROTECTION ACT. THEY ARE CRITICAL.   THEY ARE CRITICAL TO KEEPING FAITH WITH COAL COMMITTEES AND KEEPING SAFETY ON THE JOB. I HOPE THE CONGRESS WILL PASS THEM AND THE PRESIDENT WILL SIGN THEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BY THE WAY, I HEARD MR. BLANKENSHIP WAS OUTSIDE MY EVENT YESTERDAY, PROTESTING ME.   WELL, IF DONALD TRUMP WANTS THE SUPPORT OF SOMEONE LIKE THAT, HE CAN HAVE IT.   AT A TIME WHEN CHINESE CHEATING IS KILLING AMERICAN STEEL JOBS, I WILL NOT LEAVE OUR STEELWORKERS TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES. AS PRESIDENT I WILL MAKE SURE WE STEP UP AND INITIATE CASES AGAINST CHINA BEFORE JOBS ARE LOST, NOT AFTER. AND I INTEND TO APPOINT A SPECIAL TRADE PROSECUTOR AND PUSH FOR STRONGER RULE OF ORIGIN STANDARDS SO CHINESE STEEL DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR TO AMERICAN MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE, AS PART OF FOREIGN CARS.   AND I OPPOSE ANY EFFORT TO GRANT SO-CALLED MARKET ECONOMY STATUS TO CHINA BECAUSE IT WOULD WEAKEN OUR ABILITIES TO STOP CHINA FROM DUMPING CHEAP STEEL ON THE GLOBAL MARKET. IT IS ILLEGAL AND IT IS HURTING AMERICAN WORKERS AND WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE IT STOP. I AM SO PROUD TO BE STANDING UP HERE WITH YOUR SENATOR BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS AND TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN.   SECOND, WE NEED TO INVEST IN CREATING MORE GOOD PAYING JOBS HERE IN APPALACHIA. WE KNOW THIS REGION IS RICH IN ASSETS FAR BEYOND COAL. WE ALSO KNOW ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLANS DESIGNED IN WASHINGTON WITHOUT LOCAL INPUT WILL NOT DELIVER RESULTS FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. THAT IS WHY I WANT TO SUPPORT LOCALLY DRIVEN PRIORITIES, NOT SUPPLANT THEM. MY PLAN WILL CREATE A NEW COAL COMMUNITY CHALLENGE FUND TO SUPPORT INVESTMENTS BY APPALACHIAN'S FOR APPALACHIAN'S. WHEN I WAS IN MINGO COUNTY YESTERDAY IN WILLIAMSON, I HEARD FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHO TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY ARE TRYING TO GENERATE MORE SMALL BUSINESS TO CREATE MORE JOBS. THEY STARTED AN INCUBATOR TO HELP LOCAL ENTREPRENEURS GET NEW VENTURES OFF THE GROUND. THEY KNEW THAT THEY NEEDED BETTER HOUSING SO THEY PUT PEOPLE TO WORK, REFURBISHING HOMES AND BUSINESSES. THEY REALIZED MANY OTHER NEIGHBORS WERE STRUGGLING WITH OPIATE ADDICTION AND OTHER CHRONIC HEALTH ISSUES LIKE DIABETES, SO THEY OPENED A NONPROFIT HEALTH CLINIC. MEANWHILE, THE COUNTY THERE IS STEPPING UP BY REPURPOSING THEIR ABANDONED MINE LANDS FOR NEW INDUSTRIAL PARK LANDS THAT WILL BRING IN THE POTENTIAL FOR BIG EMPLOYERS. THIS IS THE KIND OF LOCALLY DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT THAT I THINK CAN REALLY WORK. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO MORE TO SUPPORT IT. ACROSS THE RIVER FROM WILLIAMSON IN KENTUCKY, I LEARNED ABOUT A COMPANY CALLED BIT SOURCE THAT TRAINS FORMER MINERS TO BE COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS AND MATCHES THEM TO JOBS IN EASTERN KENTUCKY. SILICON VALLEY TECH COMPANIES ARE LEARNING ABOUT THESE MINERS' TECHNICAL CHOPS AND HIRING THEM. THIS IS NOT A SILVER BULLET BY ANY MEANS, BUT IT IS HELPING, AND WE NEED TO GROW THAT KIND OF CREATIVE, ENTREPRENEURIAL APPROACH. MIX HARD-WORKING PEOPLE WITH SKILLS THAT ARE NEEDED TO CREATE THOSE JOBS AND ATTRACT INVESTMENTS. WITH MORE ACCESS TO FAST RELIABLE BROADBAND, WE COULD DO EVEN MORE IN THIS REGION.   I TELL YOU, IT -- EIGHT YEARS AGO, I SPENT A LOT TIME DRIVING THE ROAD TO WEST VIRGINIA. I SPENT A LOT TIME YESTERDAY AND TODAY DRIVING THE ROADS OF WEST VIRGINIA. AND YOU ARE DISCONNECTED, YOU ARE DISCONNECTED. WEST VIRGINIA DESERVES JUST AS MUCH BROADBAND ACCESS AS ANY PLACE ELSE IN AMERICA AND SO DOES SOUTHERN OHIO AND EASTERN KENTUCKY AND ALL THE REST OF THE REGION.   THAT IS ONE OF MY GOALS. JUST LIKE WE HAD TO FINISH ELECTRIFYING THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. UTILITIES GO WHERE THE BUSINESS IS, THEY DO NOT WANT TO CLIMB MOUNTAINS AND GET THE RIVERS TO GET TO 10 PEOPLE, YOU TO GO TO CITIES AND SUBURBS WHERE IT IS EASY. THEY WANT TO GO TO A GREAT UNIVERSITY LIKE THIS ONE WHERE THERE IS A LOT OF USERS. WE HAVE TO FINISH THE JOB OF CONNECTING UP AMERICA.   AND I AM CONVINCED, WHEN WE DO WE WILL SEE A WHOLE BUNCH OF NEW SMALL BUSINESSES AND CREATIVE IDEAS BE PUT INTO ACTION. AND I WANT TO SUPPORT WHAT I LEARNED YESTERDAY, LET'S REPURPOSE ABANDONED MINE LANDS AND POWER PLANTS TO SUPPORT NEW JOBS LIKE THE INDUSTRIAL PARK IN HOLDEN, WHICH MAKES WOOD PRODUCTS ON THE SITE OF A FORMER COAL MINE. AND LET'S EXPAND THE NEW MARKETS TAX CREDIT, SOMETHING MY HUSBAND STARTED IN THE 1990'S, TO STEER INVESTMENT AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE TO APPALACHIA. HAVING A GOOD JOB IS ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN GETTING A PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY AND A SENSE OF PURPOSE. I DO NOT WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO HAVE TO LEAVE HOME TO FIND THOSE THINGS. I WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO STATE RIGHT HERE IN THIS REGION, BE NEAR THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND EARN A GOOD LIVING. BE ABLE TO GIVE THEIR KIDS A GREAT LIFE. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO LEAVE HOME WHEN WE ARE IN SUCH A CONNECTED WORLD NOW. LET'S CONNECT OURSELVES UP, LET'S GET CREATIVE. I KNOW WE CAN CREATE A REALLY BRIGHT FUTURE. AND THE THIRD PART OF OUR PLAN FOR REVITALIZING APPALACHIAN COMMUNITIES IS INVESTING IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING. MORE THAN EVER, SOME FORM OF ADVANCED EDUCATION. IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY, IT COULD BE APPRENTICESHIP, COMMUNITY COLLEGES, BUT IT MAKES A REAL DIFFERENCE. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE AND GIVE ALL YOUNG PEOPLE --   -- THE CHANCE TO GRADUATE DEBT FREE.   WE WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO PAY OFF EXISTING STUDENT DEBT AND IF YOU ARE AN ENTREPRENEUR, WE WILL LET YOU DEFER YOUR STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS AND PAY NO INTEREST FOR UP TO THREE YEARS WHILE YOU GET YOUR BUSINESS OFF THE GROUND BECAUSE I WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES.   I WANT TO SEE YOUNG PEOPLE BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF INCUBATORS LIKE ACENET HERE IN SOUTHEAST OHIO.   IT SUPPORTS UP TO 30 STARTUPS EVERY YEAR. IF WE MULTIPLY THAT, THINK OF WHAT WE WILL CREATE TOGETHER. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO DO NOT GO TO COLLEGE GET THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING THEY NEED TO GET A GOOD JOB. THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS OF DOING THAT, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF JOBS OUT THERE. THE LAST NUMBER I SAW WAS 1.2 MILLION JOBS WITH PEOPLE FOR SKILLS IN TRADES. WELDERS, MACHINISTS AND THE LIKE. THOSE JOBS ARE NOT ALL IN THE SAME PLACE, OBVIOUSLY, THEY ARE SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY, BUT THE MORE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THOSE SKILLS, THEY CAN START THEIR OWN BUSINESSES TOO. SO WE HAVE GOT TO LOOK HARDER AT HOW WE GIVE EVERY YOUNG PERSON THE CHANCE TO CHART HIS OR HER OWN FUTURE. THAT BEGINS EARLIER WITH GOOD SCHOOLS AND GOOD TEACHERS NO MATTER WHAT ZIP CODE YOUR CHILD LIVES IN AND THAT IS --  THAT IS A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE FOR A LOT OF COMMUNITIES IN THE REGION BECAUSE WHEN MINES CLOSE, POWER PLANTS SHUT DOWN, MILLS GO IDLE, SCHOOL DISTRICTS LOSE TAX REVENUE. LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN WATERFORD, OHIO. AFTER A NEARBY POWER PLANT SHUT DOWN, THE SCHOOL DISTRICT LOST MORE THAN $1 MILLION OUT OF A $7 MILLION ANNUAL BUDGET. THEY HAD TO LAY OFF DOZENS OF TEACHERS AND THAT IS JUST NO WAY TO GIVE OUR KIDS THE EDUCATION THAT THEY NEED. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR WAYS THAT WE COULD HELP. BACK IN THE 1990'S, WHEN THE TIMBER INDUSTRY WAS IN DECLINE IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, WE STARTED A FEDERAL PROGRAM TO KEEP LOCAL SCHOOLS OPEN AS THEY FACED DECLINING TAX REVENUES. LET'S MAKE A SIMILAR COMMITMENT TO APPALACHIAN COMMUNITIES BY MAKING SURE THAT AS COAL AND STEEL AND OTHER FACTORIES HAVE PROBLEMS, IT IS NOT TAKEN OUT ON STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. AND WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT RETRAINING PROGRAMS AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE ACTUALLY DELIVERING RESULTS FOR WORKERS. THE LAST THING ANYONE NEEDS IS MORE RETRAINING PROGRAMS FOR JOBS THAT DO NOT EXIST. WE HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF THOSE. LET'S LEARN FROM PROGRAMS THAT REALLY WORK. YESTERDAY IN WILLIAMSON, I MET A YOUNG MAN NAMED BRENDAN. HIS DAD WAS A MINER, AND HE ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WOULD BE. THEN HIS DAD LOST A JOB AND THE -- THAT GOT BRANDON THINKING ABOUT HIS FUTURE. WHEN HE WAS STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL HE LEARNED ABOUT A TRAINING PROGRAM WHERE WORKERS SPENT 33 HOURS A WEEK ON THE JOB, GETTING PAID, SIX HOURS IN THE CLASSROOM, LEARNING SKILLS LIKE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. WHEN BRANDON IS DONE, HE WILL HAVE CONCRETE SKILLS, A TWO-YEAR DEGREE, MONEY IN THE BANK, AND HE WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD THE KIND OF LIKE HE HAS WANTED RIGHT IN HIS HOMETOWN. FOURTH AND FINALLY WE HAVE TO INVEST IN FAMILIES. RAISING A FAMILY IS HARD WORK ANYWHERE, AND I THINK IT IS HARDER TODAY THAN IT WAS NOT SO LONG AGO. I TALKED TO A LOT OF YOUNG PARENTS. I AM REALLY ZEROING IN ON THIS AS A NEW GRANDMOTHER. I PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THE STRUGGLES THAT YOUNG PARENTS ARE FACING, NO MATTER WHAT LEVEL OF INCOME AND EDUCATION, THERE ARE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES. AND I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO BE MORE HELPFUL. WE MAKE IT JUST ABOUT AS HARD TO BALANCE FAMILY AND WORK AS WE CAN IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT IS WHY WE NEED PAID FAMILY LEAVE THAT SUPPORTS FAMILIES TAKING CARE OF THEIR LOVED ONES.   AND WHY WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TO GET THE COST DOWN, GET MORE COMPETITION.   AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT SPECIFIC PROBLEMS LIKE TOO MANY MINERS WITH BLACK LUNG DISEASE HAVE BEEN DENIED THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED BECAUSE COAL COMPANY FUNDED LAWYERS AND DOCTORS WITHHELD EVIDENCE OR WILLFULLY MISDIAGNOSED THEM. I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WAY BACK IN ARKANSAS, WHEN BILL AND I WERE THERE TEACHING AT THE LAW SCHOOL, HE TOOK ON A BUNCH OF BLACK LUNG DISEASE CASES, ABOUT A HUNDRED OF THEM IF I RECALL. HE AND I TRAVELED TO MEET WITH THE MINERS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO SEE WHAT COULD BE DONE TO HELP THEM. UNFORTUNATELY, THE PROBLEM NEVER STOPPED. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIS REGION LOSES TOO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE. THEY GO TO COLLEGE, THEY GO FOR WORK, AND THEY DO NOT COME BACK. THEY DO NOT SEE A WAY TO MAKE A LIVING. OTHERS STAY AND IT IS A REAL STRUGGLE. FOR MANY PEOPLE THESE PROBLEMS ARE TOO BIG TO BEAR. SO WE HAVE DRUG ABUSE, ALCOHOL ABUSE, AND SUICIDE ALL ON THE RISE ACROSS APPALACHIA. SHOCKINGLY FOR SOME, ESPECIALLY MIDDLE-AGED WHITE WOMEN, LIFE EXPECTANCY IS ACTUALLY ON THE DECLINE. APART FROM TIMES OF WAR, THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE IN THE UNITED STATES. MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS WHEN WE SAW THE STATISTICS. PEOPLE ARE DYING FROM OPIOID ABUSE, FROM HEROIN. THEY ARE DYING FROM SUICIDE. BUT I THOUGHT BILL PUT HIS FINGER ON IT. HE SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE REALLY DYING OF? THEY ARE DYING OF A BROKEN HEART. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT SHOULD CONCERN EVERY AMERICAN. WE NEED TO MAKE A NATIONAL EFFORT, WE CANNOT GO ON LIKE THIS. WE HAVE GOT TO COMMIT TO TREATING SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.   WE SHOULD BRING THE SAME URGENCY AND RESOURCES TO BEAR AS WE DO FOR HEART DISEASE OR CANCER. ADDICTION IS NOT A MORAL FAILING, IT IS A DISEASE.   AND MENTAL HEALTH IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS PHYSICAL HEALTH.   THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE GOT TO COMMIT OURSELVES TO DOING. THESE ARE ALL COMPLICATED PROBLEMS. THEY ALL INTERSECT AND THERE ARE NO EASY SOLUTIONS. BUT WE CANNOT JUST IGNORE THEM AND WE CANNOT DENY THEM. WE NEED A FULL-COURT PRESS, GOVERNMENT, BUSINESS, UNIVERSITIES, COMMUNITY GROUPS, ADVOCATES, PEOPLE PULLING TOGETHER, LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO DO. THE IDEAS I'M PUTTING OUT TODAY ARE JUST A START. I'M GOING TO TAKE EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD THESE LAST TWO DAYS, IT -- ADD IT TO EVERYTHING ELSE I HAVE HEARD OVER A LIFETIME, AND WORK WITH LEADERS TO COME UP WITH PLANS. IT IS TRULY NOT WORTH RUNNING FOR AND A SERVING AS PRESIDENT IF YOU DO NOT HELP STRUGGLING AND STRIVING AMERICANS GET HELP.   AND OF COURSE, WHAT IS THE OTHER SIDE OFFERING? UNFORTUNATELY IT IS THE SAME OLD TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS THAT HAS FAILED US BEFORE. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, BUT HIS TAX PLAN WOULD GIVE $3.2 TRILLION TO MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES. THE PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY WHO NEED IT THE LEAST. YOU KNOW WHAT WE COULD DO WITH THAT KIND OF MONEY. WE COULD MAKE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE SOLID FOR THE NEXT 75 YEARS, FOR EXAMPLE.   WE COULD REPAIR, REPLACE AND EXPAND OUR ENTIRE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE. I JUST DON'T GET IT.   THE OTHER SIDE WANTS TO GIVE THAT MONEY TO THE RICH. WHAT A WASTE. AND THEY DO NOT EVEN BOTHER TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS TO MOST OF THE PROBLEMS PEOPLE TALK TO ME ABOUT. THEY SAY THINGS LIKE LET'S GET OUT OF THE EPA. LET'S GET RID OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. CLOSING THE EPA IS NOT THE ANSWER TO REBUILDING A REGION AS WE TRANSITION TO CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY. CLOSING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL NOT STOP THE CHINESE FROM DUMPING STEEL OR REVERSE THE DECLINE IN JOBS. IT WILL NOT FIX THE ROADS OR KEEP THE SCHOOLS OPEN. WE HAVE GOT TO STAY FOCUSED ON WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER AND WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS, MY FRIENDS. I AM ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH EVERYBODY. PART OF THE JOB OF BEING THE PRESIDENT IS TO BE THE CONVENER IN CHIEF. BRING PEOPLE TO THE WHITE HOUSE, SIT AROUND THE TABLE, TALK AND LISTEN TO EACH OTHER.   MAYBE HAVE A CAN OF JACKIE O'S BEER TO GET THINGS GOING.   WE DO NOT HAVE TIME TO WASTE. PEOPLE ARE DISCOURAGED, PEOPLE ARE DISHEARTENED, PEOPLE FEEL LIKE OUR GOVERNMENT, POLITICS, AND ECONOMY HAVE FAILED THEM. LET'S MAKE THE WEALTHY PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE INSTEAD OF GIVING THEM MORE TAX BREAKS. LET'S INVEST IN APPALACHIA, GIVE THE FAMILIES HERE THE OPPORTUNITIES YOU DESERVE. I WANT TO CLOSE WITH A LETTER I RECENTLY RECEIVED FROM ANOTHER YOUNG MAN IN WEST VIRGINIA, ALSO BY THE NAME OF BRANDON. APPARENTLY, THERE WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN IT WAS A POPULAR NAME. HIS DAD IS ALSO A RETIRED MINER. HERE IS WHAT HE WROTE. THE COAL INDUSTRY HAS ALWAYS BEEN UP AND DOWN. WE ALWAYS MADE IT THROUGH TOUGH TIMES BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE AROUND US. WE KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE A COMMUNITY HERE IN WEST VIRGINIA. WE COME TOGETHER WHEN SOMEONE NEEDS HELP. IT IS NOT JUST HIS STORY, NOT JUST WEST VIRGINIA, IT IS AN AMERICAN STORY. AT OUR BEST, WE PULL TOGETHER. WE LIFT EACH OTHER UP. I THINK IT REALLY DOES TAKE A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD, TO HEAL A COMMUNITY, TO RESTORE PEOPLE'S FAITH IN THEMSELVES AND OUR COUNTRY AND OUR FUTURE. WE CANNOT ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE DIVIDED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. TO BE SET AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. TO HAVE SCAPEGOATING AND SHAMING AND BLAMING AND INSULTING INSTEAD OF AN HONEST, CANDID CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TOGETHER.   LET'S COMMIT OURSELVES TO MAKE SURE ALL OF OUR FAMILIES CAN LIVE LIVES OF DIGNITY, SECURITY AND OPPORTUNITY, AND WE TREAT EACH OTHER WITH RESPECT EVEN WHEN YOU DISAGREE. BECAUSE WE ARE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO AGREE.   AND BUILD A FUTURE THAT I SEE. A FUTURE OF CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM, TO BREAK DOWN ALL THE BARRIERS THAT ARE HOLDING PEOPLE BACK. I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS. PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE TIME, WELL, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO RESPOND TO ALL THESE ATTACKS? ALL THESE NAMES YOU ARE CALLED? I SAID, REALLY? NOT LIKE I HAVEN'T BEEN DEALING WITH THAT FOR 25 YEARS. REALLY?   BECAUSE IT IS NOT ABOUT ME. IT IS ABOUT US. I'M GOING TO STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR YOU. I'M GOING TO BE ON THE FRONT LINES FOR THIS COUNTRY THAT I LOVE THAT HAS GIVEN ME AND MY HUSBAND SO MUCH. I WANT TO MAKE SURE I CAN LOOK IN THE EYES OF MY ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE 19 MONTH OLD GRANDCHILD AND SAY HONESTLY, YOU ARE GOING TO BE GIVEN EVERY OPPORTUNITY. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS GREAT ABOUT THIS COUNTRY, CHARLOTTE? EVERY CHILD WILL BE GIVEN EVERY OPPORTUNITY. WE WILL BUILD A FUTURE THAT WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT TALENT AND HARD WORK OF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR CHILDREN. HELP ME, ATHENS. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.

SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER AND USE UP ALL HER SAVINGS AND OR SICK TIME. SOON, SHE WAS FACING FORECLOSURE AND THE PROSPECT OF LOSING THE HOME SHE LOVES FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS. HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID TO ME. MY DAUGHTER AND I LIVE IN FEAR OF THE DAY THAT WE MIGHT COME HOME AND HAVE A LOCK ON THE DOOR . WE ARE IN PAIN, WE ARE HURTING, WE WERE AND ARE THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY, THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR A HANDOUT. WE JUST WANT TO BE TREATED FAIRLY. SHE IS SPEAKING FOR SO MANY PEOPLE ACROSS OUR COUNTRY, WHO FEEL BEATEN DOWN, LEFT OUT, AND LEFT BEHIND. PEOPLE THAT WORK HARD AND DONE THEIR PART BUT JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET AHEAD, AND FIND IT TOUGH TO GET BY. UNDERNEATH ALL THESE WORRIES TOGETHER, WE WILL COME TOGETHER AND WE ARE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS.  AND YOU KNOW, I AM AWARE THAT TOO MANY PEOPLE FEEL AT THE MERCY OF FORCES TOO BIG FOR ANYONE TO CONTROL. THEY WORRY THAT THOSE OF US IN POLITICS PUT OUR OWN INTERESTS AHEAD OF THE NATIONAL INTEREST. THE FAITH THAT WE CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER, GIVE OUR KIDS A BETTER FUTURE THAT WE HAD IS AT THE HEART OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. IT IS ONE OF MANY REASONS THAT BEING AMERICAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN SUCH A BLESSING. OUR CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT RESTORING PEOPLE'S CONFIDENCE IN OUR ABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS TOGETHER BY DELIVERING RESULTS THAT HELP PEOPLE FOLLOW THEIR OWN DREAMS. THAT'S WHY WE ARE SETTING BOLD, PROGRESSIVE GOALS BACKED UP BY REAL PLANS THAT WILL IMPROVE -- AFTER ALL, THAT IS HOW PROGRESS GETS MADE. WE HAVE TO BE BOTH DREAMERS AND DOERS.  AS A GREAT DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT ONCE SAID, THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH AMERICA THAT CAN'T BE CURED BY WHAT IS RIGHT WITH AMERICA.  I BELIEVE WE CAN CREATE MORE GOOD JOBS AND RISING INCOMES, JOBS THAT PROVIDE THE GUINEA AND PRIDE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS LIFE. WE CAN WHEN YOU ARE DEMOCRACY BY OVERTURNING CITIZENS UNITED.  WE CAN LIFT UP PEOPLE IN PLACES WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT FROM OUR INNER CITIES TO APPALACHIA, IN EVERY MANUFACTURING TOWN. EVERY COMMUNITY SCARRED BY SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ADDICTION. EVERY ROAD WHERE A CHILD GOES TO BED HUNGRY. THAT'S WHAT WE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IN. THAT'S WHAT WE KNOW IS POSSIBLE.  WE WILL BUILD ON A STRONG, PROGRESSIVE TWO EDITION FROM FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT TO BARACK OBAMA.  I APPLAUD SENATOR SANDERS AND HIS MILLIONS OF SUPPORTERS FOR CHALLENGING US TO GET UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY OUT OF OUR SIX -- POLITICS. CLOSE THE GAP OF ANY QUALITY, AND I KNOW TOGETHER WE WOULD GET THAT DONE.  BECAUSE WHETHER YOU SUPPORT SENATOR SANDERS OR YOU SUPPORT ME, THERE IS MUCH MORE THAT UNITES US THAN DIVIDES US.  WE ALL AGREED THAT WAGES ARE TOO LOW AND INEQUALITY IS TOO HIGH, THAT WALL STREET CAN NEVER AGAIN BE ABLE TO THREATEN MAIN STREET. WE SHOULD EXPAND SOCIAL SECURITY, NOT PRIVATIZE IT. WE DEMOCRATS AGREE THAT COLLEGE SHOULD BE AFFORDABLE TO ALL, AND STUDENT DEBT SHOULDN'T HOLD ANYONE BACK.  WE DEMOCRATS AGREE THAT EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN SHOULD AND MUST HAVE QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE.  WE AGREE THAT OUR NEXT PRESIDENT MUST KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE, KEEP OUR TROOPS OUT OF ANOTHER COSTLY GROUND WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  WE DEMOCRATS AGREE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN URGENT THREAT.  AND IT REQUIRES AN AGGRESSIVE RESPONSE, THAT CAN MAKE AMERICA THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF THE 21ST CENTURY. WE DEMOCRATS AGREE ON DEFENDING ALL OF OUR RIGHTS, CIVIL RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS, WORKERS RIGHTS AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS, LGBT RIGHTS AND RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.  IN THIS ELECTION, WE WILL STAND TOGETHER AND WORK HARD TO PREVAIL AGAINST CANDIDATES ON THE OTHER SIDE, WHO WOULD THREATEN ALL THOSE RIGHTS AND PIT AMERICANS AGAINST EACH OTHER. THEY WOULD MAKE IT HARDER TO VOTE, NOT EASIER. THEY WOULD DENY WOMEN THE RIGHT TO MAKE OUR OWN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE DECISIONS. THEY WOULD ROUND UP MILLIONS OF HARD-WORKING IMMIGRANTS AND IMPORT THEM. THEY WOULD DEMONIZE AND DISCRIMINATE AGAINST HARD-WORKING, TERROR HATING MUSLIM AMERICANS, WHOM WE NEED IN THE FIGHT AGAINST RADICALIZATION. AND THE CANDIDATES IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DENIED CLIMATE CHANGE EVEN EXISTS.  NOW THE OTHER DAY, MR. TRUMP ACCUSED ME OF PLAYING THE WOMAN CARD. , IF FIGHTING FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND EQUAL PAY IS PLAYING THE WOMAN CARD, THEN DEAL ME IN.  SO MY FRIENDS, IF YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT, AN INDEPENDENT, YOU KNOW THEIR APPROACH IS NOT GOING TO BUILD AN AMERICA WHERE WE INCREASE OPPORTUNITY OR DECREASE INEQUALITY. INSTEAD OF LETTING THEM TAKE US BACKWARDS, WE WANT AMERICA TO BE IN THE FUTURE BUSINESS.  THAT'S WHY WANT YOU TO KEEP IMAGINING AND TOMORROW WHERE INSTEAD OF BUILDING WALLS, WE ARE BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS. WE ARE MAKING IT MORE LIKELY THAT AMERICANS WILL BE PART OF A PROSPEROUS, DECENT SOCIETY. WE ARE IMAGINING A TOMORROW WHERE EVERY PARENT CAN FIND A GOOD JOB, AND EVERY GRANDPARENT CAN ENJOY A RETIREMENT. WE ARE IMAGINING THAT TOMORROW WHERE NO CHILD GROWS UP IN THE SHADOW OF DISCRIMINATION OR UNDER THE SPECTER OF DEPORTATION, AND WHERE EVERY CHILD HAS A GOOD TEACHER AND A GOOD SCHOOL, NO MATTER WHAT AREA THAT CHILD LIVES IN.  IMAGINE A TOMORROW WHERE ANY YOUNG PERSON CAN GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE DEBT-FREE.  WE ARE GOING TO IMAGINE A TOMORROW WHERE HARD WORK IS HONORED, FAMILIES ARE SUPPORTED, STREETS ARE SAFE AND COMMUNITIES ARE STRONG AND WHERE LOVE, TRUST .  THAT IS THE FUTURE I WANT. I WANT THAT FUTURE FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTERS AND FOR ALL OF OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. THINK OF THIS. OUR NATION WAS BORN RIGHT HERE IN PHILADELPHIA.  OUR DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND CONSTITUTION WERE ASSIGNED JUST A FEW BLOCKS AWAY. EVER SINCE, EVEN THROUGH DARK AND DIFFICULT CHAPTERS OF OUR HISTORY, THE IDEA OF AMERICA HAS SHOWN THROUGH. AT OUR BEST, WE ARE A -- AS ROBERT KENNEDY SAID, GREAT COUNTRY, AND UNSELFISH COUNTRY AND A COMPASSIONATE COUNTRY.  BUT, AMERICA'S GREATNESS MUST BE EARNED BY EVERY GENERATION. PLEASE, JOIN US, GO TO HILLARY CLINTON.COM CHECK JOIN, VOLUNTEER, CONTRIBUTE, LET'S GO FORWARD, LET'S WIN THE NOMINATION AND IN JULY WE RETURN . THANK YOU SO MUCH.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU, SENATOR BOB CASEY.   >> WOW. IT IS SO GREAT TO BE BACK IN NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA TO BE HERE IN DUNMORE.  I STOPPED IN SCRANTON ON MY WAY HERE. I ALWAYS FEEL SO MUCH AT HOME. I STOPPED AT CASA BELLA RESTAURANT. BUT I WAS RUNNING LATE SO MY PLAN TO ACTUALLY EAT DINNER WAS KIND OF ABBREVIATED, BUT I SAID HELLO TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE, AND I MET PEOPLE WHO SAID THINGS TO ME LIKE, I KNEW YOUR COUSINS. I KNEW YOUR UNCLES. I HAD ONE MAN SAY, DIDN'T WE SLED DOWN COURT STREET ONE WINTER? I SAID, COULD HAVE BEEN. COULD HAVE BEEN. I WAS THERE. MET ANOTHER WOMAN WHO LIVED NEXT DOOR TO MY GRANDPARENTS ON DIAMOND AVENUE. AND IT JUST BRINGS BACK A FLOOD OF THE BEST MEMORIES, AND THE BEST PEOPLE. AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HAPPY AND PROUD I AM TO BE BACK HERE WITH ALL OF YOU. WANT TO THANK NOT ONLY THE SENATOR, WANT TO THANK THE CONGRESSMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MATT CARTWRIGHT. THE MAYORS, THE MAYOR OF DONE MODER, THE MAYOR OF SCRANTON WHO ARE HERE, THE DEMOCRATIC COUNTY CHAIR, AND THE DEMOCRATIC CHAIR OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON. I WANT TO THANK SANDY AND EVERYBODY WHO HAS HELPED TO MAKE THIS EVENING JUST SUCH A HAPPY OCCASION. I HAVE MY TWO BROTHERS HERE. THEY LOVE COMING BACK, AND OF COURSE, THEY GO EVERY SUMMER LAKE LINOLA TO THE COTTAGE MY GRANDFATHER BUILT. SO THIS PLACE HAS A LOT OF NOT JUST MEMORIES BUT SPECIAL MEANING TO ME, AND THE THING I WANT YOU TO KNOW MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, IS I WILL WORK MY HEART OUT FOR THE PEOPLE HERE IN NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA.  I WILL BE A GOOD PARTNER BECAUSE WE HAVE WORK TO DO. WE HAVE WORK TO DO TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH GOOD JOBS, WITH RISING INCOMES FOR PEOPLE WILLING TO WORK TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. AND WE'RE GOING TO LOOK FOR THOSE NEW JOBS IN INFRASTRUCTURE, OR ROADS, BRIMS, PORTS, AIRPORTS, RAIL SYSTEM, ALL NEED WORK.   >> AND I AGREE WITH CONGRESSMAN CARTWRIGHT, WE NEED PASSENGER RAIL SERVICE FROM NORTHEAST PENNSYLVANIA. SO, WHAT I THINK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE, I THINK ABOUT GOOD JOBS, JOBS THAT CAN'T BE EXPORTED, JOBS THAT PUT PEOPLE IN THIS AREA TO WORK, THAT PAY A GOOD WAGE, SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET AHEAD. AND WE'RE GOING TO ALSO LOOK TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO IN ADVANCE MANUFACTURING, BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE CAN STILL MAKE IT IN AMERICA AND WE'RE GOING TO FIND WAYS TO DO THAT.  AND WE NEED MORE CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY JOBS THAT WILL PUT PEOPLE TO WORK RIGHT HERE, AND WE NEED TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES, SMALL BUSINESSES CREATE MOST OF THE JOBS. AND WE'RE NOT CREATING ENOUGH SMALL BUSINESSES. WE HAVE TOO MANY OBSTACLES IN THE WAY. MY IDEA ABOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IS, LET'S KNOCK DOWN THE BARRIERS. THE BARRIERS THAT STAND IN THE WAY OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO START BUSINESSES, THAT WILL EMPLOY MORE PEOPLE, AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK HARD TO RAISE THE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE. BECAUSE --   -- BUS YOU HAVE 150,000 PENNSYLVANIANS WORKING FOR .25  -- $7.25 AN HOUR. THOUSANDS MORE WORKING ON WHAT IS CALLED THE TIPPED WAGE. OKAY. SOME OF YOU KNOW ABOUT IT BUT A LOT OF YOU DON'T. IT'S KIND OF A SECRET BUT HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. IF YOU'RE IN CERTAIN JOBS, LIKE WAITRESSING, BARTENDING, HAIR SALONS, THOSE KIND OF JOBS, YOU CAN BE PAID AS LITTLE IN OUR COUNTRY AS $2.13 AN HOUR. BECAUSE THE IDEA IS YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY FROM TIPS. I TELL YOU WHAT. THAT IS JUST A DISGRACE. SO, IF PEOPLE ARE WORKING FULL-TIME, THEY SHOULD NOT STILL BE IN POVERTY AT THE END OF THE YEAR.   >> AND TWO-THIRDS OF ALL MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS ARE WOMEN, AND MANY OF THEM ARE SINGLE MOMS TAKING CARE OF THEIR KIDS.  SO I AM GOING TO FIGHT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, AND I'M ALSO GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO GUARANTEE EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN'S WORK. YOU KNOW WHY? I'LL TELL YOU. THIS IS NOT JUST A WOMEN'S ISSUE. IF YOU HAVE A MOTHER, WIFE, A SISTER, OR A DAUGHTER, WHO ARE WORKING, AND THEY NORTH BEING PAID WHAT THEY SHOULD BE PAID COMPARED TO OTHERS, THEN YOU'RE GETTING SHORT CHANGED. YOUR FAMILY IS. THE ECONOMY IS. I DID AN EVENT THIS MORNING IN PHILADELPHIA WITH A WOMAN NAMED LILLY LEDBETTER. SOME OF YOU KNOW THAT SHE WORKED AS A SUPERVISOR IN A FACTORY IN ALABAMA FOR 40 YEARS. SHE HAD A SUPERVISOR JOB. SHE WAS THE ONLY WOMAN WITH THE SUPERVISOR JOB. AND SHE DID NOT KNOW FOR YEARS THAT SHE MADE 40 PERCENT LESS THAN THE MEN DO IN THE SAME JOB. AND AS SHE RIGHTLY SAID, SHE AND HER HUSBAND WERE WORKING HARD. AND WHEN SHE AND I WERE TALKING SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GO TO THE STORE YOU DON'T GET A WOMEN'S DISCOUNT BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET PAID THE SAME. AND NOW SHE IS RETIRED. HER SOCIAL SECURITY WON'T BE THE SAME BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT PAID THE SAME. HER 401 WILL NOT BE THE SAME. SO THIS HAS A LOT OF IMPLICATIONS FOR EVERYBODY, AND IT'S TIME WE SAID, LOOK, IN AMERICA, IF YOU DO THE JOB YOU GET THE EQUAL PAY. MEN AND WOMEN ALIKE. AND --   -- WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO RAISE EVERYBODY'S PAY BECAUSE NOBODY'S GETTING A RAISE.   >> AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GO WHERE THE MONEY IS, WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING THINGS LIKE PASSENGER RAIL. THE MONEY IS AT THE TOP. I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE RUNNING IN EITHER PARTY WHO HAS PLEDGED I WILL NOT RAISE MIDDLE CLASS TAXES BECAUSE THE MIDDLE CLASS NEEDS A RAISE, NOT A TAX INCREASE.  THAT'S WHY I'VE LAID OUT ALL THESE PLANS ABOUT HOW WE'LL CREATE JOBS, HOW WE'LL END THE LOOPHOLES, GET RID OF THE DEDUCTIONS THAT GIVE PEOPLE AT THE TOP A CHANCE TO GO A LOT FURTHER THAN ANYBODY ELSE, AND IT IS A FACT THAT THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER WHEN WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE.  BECAUSE EVERYTHING I'VE JUST SAID, THE LEADING REPUBLICANS DON'T AGREE WITH. DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY SAYS --   >> HE ACTUALLY SAYS WAGES ARE TOO HIGH IN AMERICA. I MEAN, HONESTLY, DON'T KNOW WHO HE TALKED. TO OUT TO GET OUT OF THE TOWERS AND COME DOWN AND TALK WITH PEOPLE, AND LISTEN TO THEM.   >> MY HUSBAND WAS HERE A WEEK OR SO AGO, AND IT WASN'T ANCIENT HISTORY. SOME OF US CAN REMEMBER. WE HAD EIGHT YEARS WITH 23 MILLION NEW JOBS.   >> AND DURING THOSE EIGHT YEARS, INCOMES WENT UP FOR EVERYBODY, NOT JUST PEOPLE AT THE TOP. MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES, WORKING FAMILIES, POOR FAMILIES, THERE WERE ENOUGH JOBS AND THE INCOMES WERE GOING UP. SO THE MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME WENT UP 17% IN THOSE EIGHT YEARS.  NOW, IT WILL SURPRISE YOU TO HEAR -- WON'T SURPRISE YOU TO HEAR ME SAY I THINK THERE ARE SOME LESSONS WE CAN LEARN FROM THAT. AND THERE'S ANOTHER LESSON WE CAN LEARN, WHY DIDN'T IT CONTINUE? BECAUSE WE GOT A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT. AND THEY WENT BACK TO TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS, AND PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT TRUMP AND CRUZ ARE SAYING. THEY WANT TO GO BACK TO TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS ON STEROIDS. WE HAVE BEEN DOWN THAT ROAD. IT DID NOT WORK. WE HAD A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHO SLASHED TAXES FOR THE WEALTHY. I WAS VOTING AGAINST IT IN THE SENATE. SPEAKING OUT AGAINST IT IN THE SENATE. THEY TOOK THEIR EYE OFF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE MORTGAGE MARKETS, AND WE HAD THE GREAT RECESSION. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVEN'T EVEN RECOVERED FROM THAT. SO, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, WHY WOULD WE GO BACK TO THE FAILED POLICIES THAT DROPPED US INTO THE DITCH THAT THE REPUBLICANS DUG FOR OUR COUNTRY? AND I KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS. WE WERE LOSING 8,000 JOBS A MONTH WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS ELECTED. NATIONAL MILLION AMERICANS LOST THEIR JOBS. MULTIPLY THAT BY FAMILY MEMBERS. FIVE MILLION HOMES LOST. MULTIPLY THAT BY FAMILY MEMBERS. $13 TRILLION IN FAMILY WEALTH WIPED OUT. I DON'T THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA GETS THE CREDIT EHE DESERVES FOR DIGGING US OUT OF THE DITCH SOUTH AND US BACK ON SOLID GROUND. SO, WE ARE PACK CREATING JOBS. WE ARE BACK WITH A LOWER UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. BUT WE DON'T YET HAVE THE KIND OF ENERGY THAT IS PRODUCING THE RESULTS THAT I WANT TO SEE FOR THE MESH PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY WE'VE GOT TO BUILT ON WHAT HAS BEEN DONE, DON'T GET TALKED INTO SOME SORT OF DETOUR. I LOVE IT. THE REPUBLICANS -- AND I DIDDLEYSEN TO THEM DURING THE LAST -- I DIDDLEYSEN TO THEM DURING THE LAST YEAR. DID IT SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY THEY SAY THINGS LIKE IT'S THE LOWEST RECOVERY IN HISTORY. THAT TAKES A LOT OF NERVE. WE WOULDN'T HAVE NEED A RECOVERY IF THEY HADN'T WRECKED THE ECONOMY IN THE FIRST PLACE! SO I GOT TO TELL YOU, DON'T KNOW WHO THEY'LL END UP NOMINATING BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD, I'M FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE THE NOMINEE TO ACTUALLY HAVING A DEBATE ABOUT ECONOMICS. I A DEBATE ABOUT MORE GOOD JOBS, A DEBATE ABOUT RISING INCOMES. I'M ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO DEBATING ABOUT EDUCATION, AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO INVEST IN EDUCATION. EVERY CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY DESERVES A GOOD TEACHER AND A GOOD SCHOOL, REGARDLESS OF TO THE ZIP CODE THAT CHILD LIVES IN.  AND WE NEED TO DO MORE FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SO MORE KIDS ARE PREPARED WHEN THEY ACTUALLY GET TO SCHOOL TO LEARN. AND I WANT TO BE A GOOD PARTNER WITH OUR TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS, AND I APPRECIATE THEM BEING HERE WITH THEIR BLUE T-SHIRTS ON. THANK YOU! AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE. AND I'VE LAID OUT A PLAN ABOUT HOW WE'LL DO IT. HOW IT WILL WORK. AND I KNOW THAT WE CAN. ACTUALLY MAKE IT HAPPEN. BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING THAT NOW IS STOPPING A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE FROM STARTING COLLEGE, AND COMPLETING COLLEGE. AND MY PLAN HAS DEBT-FREE TUITION BUT ALSO SAYS TO COLLEGES, PUBLIC COLLEGES, UNIVERSITIES, YOU GOT TO GET YOUR COSTS UNDER CONTROL. YOU GOT TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT WHAT YOU ARE CHARGING YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES, AND MY OPPONENTS' PLAN RELIES ON REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS TO PAY A THIRD OF THE COST. SOMEHOW I DON'T THINK A LOT OF THESE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ARE GOING TO DO THAT. SO I DON'T WANT TO MAKE PROMISES I CAN'T KEEP. I'VE PUT FORTH A PLAN I CAN DELIVER. DEBT-FREE TUITION. AND THEN WE'VE GOT TO TACKLE THE DEBT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ALREADY HAVE. HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE STUDENT DEBT? HOW MANY HAVE EVER HAD STUDENT DEBT? YOU KNOW, I MEET YOUNG PEOPLE WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF STUDENT DEBT, AND REALLY HIGH INTEREST RATES. RIGHT? AND I GOT TO TELL YOU, IT MAKES NO SENSE. TOOK OUT LOANS WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE AND LAW SCHOOL, BUT I DIDN'T HAVE A TEN,  , 12, 14% INTEREST RATE AND I IMMEDIATE YOUNG PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO DO. SO WE'RE GOING TO LET YOU REFINANCE YOUR STUDENT DEBT. IF YOU CAN REFINANCE AN MORTGAGE OR CAR PAYMENT YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO REFINANCE YOUR STUDENT DEBT AND IF YOU PAY YOUR STUDENT DEBT PAYMENTS EVERY MONTH, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A CUTOFF TIME AFTER 20 YEARS YOU'RE DONE BECAUSE IT SHOULD NOT KEEP GOING FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT HEALTH CARE IS AFFORDABLE, AND THAT YOU HAVE CHOICES. I'M GOING TO DEFEND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BECAUSE IT TOOK SO LONG FOR US TO GET TO THIS POINT.   >> YOU KNOW, BEFORE THERE WAS SOMETHING CALLED OBAMACARE THERE WAS SOMETHING CALLED HILLARYCARE. AND WE WORKED REALLY, REALLY HARD, BUT I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU I GOT BEAT BY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE DRUG COMPANIES. THEY JUST KNOCKED ME DOWN. I LOVE IT WHEN SOME PEOPLE RUNNING FOR THIS OFFICE TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE ON THE SPECIAL INTERESTS. I'VE DONE IT. AND I KNOW YOU GOT TO BE PREPARED, YOU GOT BE READY, AND YOU GOT TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO BEAT THEM BACK. SO WHEN WE WEREN'T SUCCESSFUL, I GOT UP OFF THE FLOOR AND I SAID, OKAY, WHAT CAN I DO NOW? AND I WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TO CREATE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM, WHICH INSURES EIGHT MILLION KIDS. AND I KNOW HOW MUCH THAT MEANT TO THOSE FAMILIES, AND I MEET YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COME UP AND THANK ME BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE RELIABLE HEALTH CARE BEFORE THAT PROGRAM. THAT'S WHY I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN WE PASSED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN TO AS MANY PLACES AS I HAVE IN OUR COUNTRY, AND MET SO MANY PEOPLE WHO DID NOT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE, THEY MADE TOO MUCH MONEY TO QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID, THEY DIDN'T WORK FOR PEOPLE WHO OFFERED INSURANCE, THEY COULDN'T AFFORD THE INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE MARKET. THAT'S WHY 20 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED UP SO FAR. BUT WE HAVE TO GET THE COSTS DOWN. THE COPAYS AND THE DEDUCTIBLES AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. AND I HAVE A VERY CLEAR IDEA ABOUT HOW WE'LL DO THAT. NOW THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO REPEAL IT. THEY NEVER TELL YOU WHAT THEY'LL REPLACE IT WITH BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE WON'T LIKE IT. BECAUSE IT'S JUST GOING TO TWO BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS. IF YOU HAVE PREEXISTING CONDITION YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK. IF YOU'RE 0 WOMANNOR COSTS ARE MORE THAN A MAN. IF YOU'RE A YOUNG PERSON, MAY NOT HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO STAY ON YOUR FAMILY'S POLICY UNTIL YOUR 26. LIFETIME LIMITS WILL COME BACK. SO A LOT OF WHAT WE CHANGED TO ACTUALLY GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE TO GET THE INSURANCE, TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES, WOULD BE WIPED OUT. AND MY OPPONENTS WANTS TO START ALL OVER AGAIN, AND I CAN TELL YOU WE DO NOT NEED ANOTHER BIG CONTENTIOUS DEBATE ABOUT HEALTH CARE. WE NEED TO MAKE WHAT WE'VE GOT WORK REALLY WELL. AND IMPROVE IT, AND GET THE COSTS OUT OF UPWARD SPIRAL. WANT TO MENTION WHO OTHER THINGS BECAUSE YOU DON'T HEAR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TALK BELOW THESE TWO THINGS AND I AM REALLY DETERMINED WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THOSE. NUMBER ONE, WE NEED MORE TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS.  I WAS TALKING TO CONGRESSMAN TARGET WRITHE BEFORE I CAME OUT  -- CARTWRIGHT BEFORE I CAME OUT AND TALKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR OFFICE. I SAID THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO PERSONAL. I MEET PEOPLE FOR A MINUTE, SOMETIMED TALK TO THEM FOR 30 MINUTES, BUT PEOPLE WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT IS ON THEIR MINDS BECAUSE THEY'RE HOPING THAT YOU OR SOMEBODY CAN HELP AND THE TWO THINGS I HEAR THE MOST ABOUT, YES, OF COURSE, ECONOMICS, KNOCKING DOWN THE BARRIERS, BUT MENTAL HEALTH IN ADDICTION. AND SO WHEN I SHAKE A HAND OF A MOTHER OR FATHER OR SISTER OR BROTHER OR CHILD AND THEY SAY, PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT MOMENT HEALTH. I KNOW IT'S -- MENTAL HEALTH. NOW IT'S PERMANENT. MAYBE IT AFFECTS SOMEBODY THEY KNOW OR RELATED TO, AND I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAVE LED TO SOMEBODY SAYING, PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE HEROIN AND OPIODE EPIDEMIC.   >> I HAD A YOUNG MAN COME UP AND INTRODUCE HIMSELF AND SAY HE WAS GOING TO VOTE FOR ME. ASKED WHY? HE SAID I'LL TELL YOU. I PLAYED FOOTBALL IN HIGH SCHOOL. I GOT REALLY HURT MY SENIOR YEAR. I HAD TO HAVE SURGERY. I GOT OUT OF THE SURGERY I WAS IN TERRIBLE PAIN. AND THE DOCTOR PRESCRIBED OPIODES. HE SAID I'M NOT EMBARRASSED TO TELL YOU ISSUE GOT HOOKED. AND I COULDN'T SHAKE IT. COULDN'T KEEP GETTING THE PRESCRIPTION FILLED, SO I TURNED HEROIN, HE SAID. HE SAID I'M SO FORTUNATE TO BE STANDING HERE BECAUSE ABOUT A YEAR AGO, I LOST A REALLY GOOD FRIEND WHO OVERDOSED. WE WERE IN A CAR, WE WERE DOING HEROIN, HE DIED. HE SAID THAT JUST SAID TO ME, I CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS. SO I WENT TO GET HELP BUT HE SAID IT TOOK ME TWO MONTHS TO GET HELP. BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE READY TO GET HELP THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PLACES TO GO TO GET HELP. AND WE ARE LOSING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS OF ALL AGE, BUT PARTICULARLY YOUNG AMERICANS, UNDER 40, AND WE HAVE GOT TO ADDRESS THIS. SO I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN WITHIN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO REMOVE THE SIGMA ON -- THE STIGMA ON MENTAL HEALTH AND TACKLE THE HEROIN AND OPEN OPIODE EPIDEMIC. THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPORTANT ISSUES AND CONCERN WES HAVE TO ADDRESS IN THIS CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY IN OUR CITIES. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE MORE OF A DIVERSIFIED ECONOMY IN OUR RURAL AREAS. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE REVITALIZE OUR CITIES, LIKE SCRANTON AND OTHER PLACES TO BE MAGNETS TO ATTRACT MORE BUSINESS. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT THE SAFETY NET THAT EXISTS. SO I WILL NEVER LET THE REPUBLICANS PRIVATIZE SOCIAL SECURITY OR MEDICARE. AND I WILL NEVER LET THEM PRIVATIZE THE VA. WE HAVE TO IMPROVE IT AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES OUR VETERANS DESERVE TO HAVE SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THE KOCH BROTHERS AND THE REPUBLICANS DISMANTLE THE VA. WE ALSO HAVE TO BE COMMITTED TO DO MORE, TO TRY TO FIND WAYS WHERE WE ARE TALKING WITH CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM ABOUT THE FUTURE. AND I THINK THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S RIGHTS. WE HAVE TO PROTECT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN HEALTH CARE DECISIONS.  WE HAVE TO DEFEND MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND END DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY. WE HAVE TO DEFEND VOTING RIGHTS AND END CITIZENS UNITED, WHICH IS CORRUPTING OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM. WE HAVE TO BE FOCUSED ON PROTECTING WORKERS' RIGHTS AND THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN IN A UNION. NOW, WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE THE AMERICAN LABOR MOVEMENT HAPPENED TO CREATE -- HELPED TO CREATE THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS. I WAS MEETING WITH SOME CARPENTERS AND STEAM FITTERS AND ELECTRICIANS IN PITTSBURGH EARLIER TODAY, AND THEY WERE TELLING ME ABOUT THE KIND OF PRESSURE THAT THEY'RE UNDER BY FORCES IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND OTHERS WHO ARE THEIR ALLIES TO REALLY ERODE THE RIGHT TO BARGAIN, AND I WILL TELL YOU THIS, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE A MEMBER OF A UNION TO WANT THEIR TO BE UNIONS DOING THAT BECAUSE THAT RAISES THE BASE FOR EVERYBODY.  AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE I WILL TAKE ON. I WILL TAKE ON THE FIGHT FOR COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY MEASURES.  AND I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THIS, BASE LEARN HOW TO SHOOT A GUN BEHIND OUR COTTAGE. AND I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT GUN OWNERSHIP AND PARTICULARLY HUNTING, IS HERE IN NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA, AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE CAN'T IGNORE THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND WE CAN'T IGNORE THE 33,000 PEOPLE A YEAR WHO DIE FROM GUN VIOLENCE, AND I THINK WE ARE SMART ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT. AND THE GUN LOBBY DOESN'T WANT US TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT. THEY JUST WANT TO KEEP EVERYBODY ALL UPSET AND AGITATED. WELL, AT SOME POINT THEY HAVE TO ANSWER FOR THAT. RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS ACTUALLY SUPPORT WHAT I AM PROPOSING. COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS, CLOSING THE GUNSHOW LOOPHOLE, CLOSING THE ONLINE LOOPHOLE. CLOSING THE HALLS OF CHARLSTON LOOPHOLE, END THE SPECIAL PROTECTION THAT CONGRESS VOTE FOR AND GAVE TO GUNMAKERS AND SELLERS, WHICH MEANS THEY DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE ANYTHING. IT'S THE ONLY INDUSTRY IN OUR COUNTRY GIVEN THAT. SO YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT THAT COULD BE DONE TO MAKE GUNS LESS ACCESSIBLE TO KIDS. OF THOSE 33,000, WAY TOO MANY OR KID FINKED LOADED GUNS. PLAYING WITH GUNS. BEING ABLE TO PULL THAT TRIGGER. I MEAN, SAFETY LOCKS AND OTHER KINDS OF TECHNOLOGY WOULD SAVE A LOT OF CHILDREN'S LIVES. WITHOUT INFRINGING ON ONE'S SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS. SO I'M WELL AWARE I'M WALKING BEE THE BUZZ SAW HERE BUT I CAN -- WALKING INTO THE BUZZ SAW HERE. I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHEN YOU HAVE MET AS MANY VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE NOW AS I HAVE -- BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN VISITING WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LOVED ONES FOR 25 YEARS NOW. YOU EITHER BECOME TOTALLY INSENSITIVE BECAUSE IT IS TOO PAINFUL, OR YOU SAY TO YOURSELF, HEY, COME ON, WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS. I WAS IN PHILADELPHIA THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY, WITH MOTHERS WHO HAD LOST THEIR CHILDREN. I WAS IN HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT, YESTERDAY, ON A PANEL WITH A MOTHER FROM HARTFORD WHOSE BRIGHT, REALLY PROMPT MISSING 20-YEAR-OLD -- PROMISING 20-YEAR-OLD SON WAS CAUGHT IN SOME KIND OF CRAZY GANG CROSS-FIRE, JUST MINDING HIS OWN BUSINESS. I WAS THERE WITH THE DAUGHTER OF THE PRINCIPAL OF SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, WHO WENT WHEN SHE HEARD THE GUNSHOTS TO SEE WHAT SHE COULD DO TO STOP IT AND WAS MURDERED. AND I WAS THERE WITH THE MOTHER OF ONE OF THE LITTLE GIRLS WHO WAS MURDERED AT SANDY HOOK. AND WHEN YOU MEET THOSE PEOPLE, AS I HAVE, WHEN YOU HEAR THEIR STORIES, CAN YOU IMAGINE SENDING OFF YOUR SIX OR SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TO GO TO SCHOOL, MAYBE WITH A LITTLE BACKPACK, AND THEN GETTING A CALL THAT A MAN WHO WAS CLEARLY DISTURBED, AND SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAD ACCESS TO MILITARY ASSAULT WEAPONS, HAD WALKED IN THERE AND MURDERED 20 CHILDREN AND SIX ADULTS. AND THERE ARE A LOTS OF STORIES LIKE THAT. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS A VOTING ISSUE. AND RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS HAVE TO STAND UP AND SAY THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY GUNS, MY HUNTING, MY SPORTS SHOOTING, MY COLLECTING.  SO I WANT TO DO THIS AND I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A PLEDGE TO YOU THAT I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE. TO DEFEAT TERRORISTS AND ANYBODY WHOLES THREATENS OUR COUNTRY -- ELSE WHO THREATENS OUR COUNTRY OR AMERICANS ANYWHERE, AND HERE'S ANOTHER AREA WHERE TRUMP AND CRUZ ARE NOT JUST SAYING THINGS THAT ARE OFFENSIVE, WHICH THEY ARE. THEY'RE SAYING THINGS WHICH ARE DANGEROUS. AND I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THIS. I WENT TO 112 DONE TROPHIES YOUR BEHALF AS SECRETARY OF STATE --   -- AND I KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEFEAT ISIS UNLESS WE HAVE A COALITION THAT INCLUDES MUSLIM MAJORITY NATIONS. THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. AND WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHO BASICALLY SAYS WE DON'T WANT ANY MUSLIMS IN OUR COUNTRY, THAT SENDS A MESSAGE AND IT SENDS A MESSAGE WHICH MAKE THIS JOB OF BUILDING THAT COALITION A LOT HARDER. AND WHEN YOU HAVE TED CRUZ SAYING, HEY, WE NEED SPECIAL POLICE PATROLS IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE MUSLIMS LIVE, HOW THAT WOULD IF WORK, NOBODY CAN EXPLAIN BUT ENVELOPES THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. AND THE NYPD WHICH I WORKED WITH CLOSE LIVE AFTER 9/11 DURING BASE I WAS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK ON 9/11 -- THEY WERE JUST SHAKING THEIR HEADS HEARING WHAT CRUZ WAS SAYING, AND THE CHIEF OF THE DEPARTMENT SAID THAT'S AN IDEA THAT DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE. WHAT WILL WE DO WITH THE 1,000 MUSLIM AMERICAN POLICE OFFICERS WE HAVE ON THE NYPD, AND THE COMMISSIONER, BILL BRATTON 0, HAS HAS MUCH EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA AS ANYBODY SAYS TED CRUZ DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL HE IS TALKING ABOUT.   >> SO, LOOK, I KNOW SOME OF THESE LINES GET BIG APPLAUSE RESPONSES IN THESE RALLIES THAT TRUMP HAS, BUT STOP AND THINK. IS THAT SMART? DOES THAT WORK? DOES IT HELP US? DOES IT PROTECT US? AND THE ANSWER IS NO. AND THEN HE WENT EVEN FURTHER AND BASICALLY SAID HE DIDN'T CARE IF MORE COUNTRIES GOT NUCLEAR WEAPONS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE, SOMETHING THAT BOB CASEY WORKS ON, TO PREVENT MORE COUNTRIES FROM GETTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND HAVING A FREE-FOR-ALL THAT BROUGHT MORE NUCLEAR WEAPONS INTO THE WORLD. SO I'M TELLING YOU, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO DEBATING THEM ON THE ECONOMY AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO DEBATING THEM ON NATIONAL SECURITY BECAUSE WE'RE ELECTING A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, AS WELL AS A PRESIDENT.  SO LET ME JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THIS. I THINK ONE OF THE JOBS OF THE NEXT PRESIDENT HAS TO TAKE ON IS UNIFYING OUR COUNTRY. WE'VE GOT TOO MUCH DIVISION. IT'S FINE TO HAVE A BACK AND FORTH IN A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. THAT GOES WITH THE TERRITORY. BUT WHEN THE POLITICS ARE OVER, WHEN THE CAME PANS ARE DONE, WHEN THE ELECTS HAVE BEEN HELD, WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER. DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM IS NOT ENOUGH. WE NEED SOLUTIONS THAT ARE GOING BRING PEOPLE TO THE TABLE, AND ACTUALLY ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES, AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THIS ABOUT ME. IN EVERY JOB I'VE EVER HAD I HAVE WORKED HARD TO FIND COMMON GROUND. DID IT AS FIRST LADY, AS A SENATOR, AS SECRETARY OF STATE. WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE, FINDING WAYS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. I TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE. A LOT OF REPUBLICANS HAVE NICE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT ME WHEN I'M ACTUALLY WORKING ON THE JOB. AND I WON'T PROBABLY BE PUBLICIZING ALL THOSE NICE THINGS AS WE GOOD FORWARD. NOW, WHEN I AM ACTUALLY RUNG FOR A JOB, MY GOSH, THEY'RE AFTER ME FROM SUN UP TO WAY PAST SUNDOWN, I GET THAT. AND THEY CALL ME NAMES AND ALL THE REST OF IT. I DON'T MIND, BECAUSE WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT I DO WHAT I TELL YOU I WILL DO. THAT I WANT YOU TO HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT I WILL DO. THAT WE WILL WORK TOGETHER ACROSS EVERY LINE THAT DIVIDES US. THAT WE WILL CREATE A FUTURE THAT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN CAN HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THAT SHOULD BE THE BIRTHRIGHT OF ANY AMERICANS. I AM SO GRATEFUL I WAS BORN IN THE COUNTRY. I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT I HAD PARENTS WHO UNDERSTOOD HARD WORK. I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT I HAVE A CHANCE TO TRY TO DO THE SAME FOR MY GRANDCHILD AND I WANT TO BE THE CHAMPION FOR ALL OF AMERICA BUT PARTICULARLY FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN, THEY DESERVE NO LESS. LET'S GO OUT AND PLEASE VOTE ON TUESDAY IN THE PRIMARY! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!

YOU KNOW, TODAY YOU PROVED ONCE AGAIN THERE IS NO PLACE LIKE HOME.   YOU KNOW, IN THIS CAMPAIGN, WE HAVE WON IN EVERY REGION OF THE COUNTRY.   FROM THE NORTH TO THE SOUTH, TO THE EAST TO THE WEST, BUT THIS ONE IS PERSONAL.   NEW YORKERS, YOU ALWAYS -- YOU HAVE ALWAYS HAD MY BACK. AND I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO HAVE YOURS. TODAY, TOGETHER, WE DID IT AGAIN, AND I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL. I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO CAME OUT AND VOTED, AND TO ALL OF YOU ACROSS NEW YORK WHO HAVE KNOWN ME AND WORKED WITH ME FOR SO LONG. [CHEERS AND  IT IS HUMBLING THAT YOU TRUST ME WITH THE AWESOME RESPONSIBILITIES THAT AWAIT OUR NEXT PRESIDENT.   AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED SENATOR SANDERS, I BELIEVE THERE IS MUCH MORE THAT UNITES US THAN DIVIDES US.   YOU KNOW, WE STARTED THIS RACE NOT FAR FROM HERE ON ROOSEVELT ISLAND. PLEDGING TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESSIVE TRADITION THAT HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR AMERICA, FROM FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT TO BARACK OBAMA.   AND TONIGHT, A LITTLE LESS THAN A YEAR LATER, THE RACE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION IS IN THE HOME STRETCH AND VICTORY IS IN SIGHT!    I WANT TO SAY TO ALL OF MY SUPPORTERS AND ALL OF THE VOTERS, YOU HAVE CARRIED US EVERY STEP OF THE WAY WITH PASSION AND DETERMINATION THAT SOME CRITICS TRIED TO DISMISS. BECAUSE OF YOU, THIS CAMPAIGN IS THE ONLY ONE, DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, TO WIN MORE THAN 10 MILLION VOTES.   BUT I AM GOING FORWARD BECAUSE MORE VOICES REMAIN TO BE HEARD. AND TOMORROW, IT IS ON TO CONNECTICUT, DELAWARE, MARYLAND, PENNSYLVANIA, RHODE ISLAND, AND BEYOND. WE NEED YOU TO KEEP VOLUNTEERING. I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN THE 1.1 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY CONTRIBUTED AT HILLARYCLINTON.COM. AND BY THE WAY, MOST WITH LESS THAN $100. BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO. UNDER THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF NEW YORK, WE HAVE SEEN IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO DIAGNOSE PROBLEMS. YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN HOW YOU WOULD ACTUALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEMS.   THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TOGETHER FOR OUR KIDS, FOR EACH OTHER, FOR OUR COUNTRY. SO I WANT YOU WITH ME TO IMAGINE A TOMORROW WHERE NO BARRIERS HOLD YOU BACK AND ALL OF OUR PEOPLE CAN SHARE IN THE PROMISE OF AMERICA. IMAGINE A TOMORROW WHERE EVERY PARENT CAN FIND A GOOD JOB AND EVERY GRANDPARENT CAN ENJOY A SECURE RETIREMENT.   WHERE NO CHILD GROWS UP IN THE SHADOW OF DISCRIMINATION OR UNDER THE SPECTRE OF DEPORTATION.   WHERE HARD WORK IS HONORED, FAMILIES ARE SUPPORTED, AND COMMUNITIES ARE STRONG. A TOMORROW WHERE WE TRUST AND RESPECT EACH OTHER, DESPITE OUR DIFFERENCES. [CHEERS AND  BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO MAKE POSITIVE DIFFERENCES IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. THAT IS WHAT THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT, ACTUALLY HELPING PEOPLE AND EACH OTHER. [CHEERS AND  NOW, WE ALL KNOW --   WE ALL KNOW TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL HURTING. I SEE IT EVERYWHERE I GO. THE GREAT RECESSION WIPED OUT JOBS, HOMES, AND SAVINGS. AND A LOT OF AMERICANS HAVE NOT YET RECOVERED. BUT I STILL BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART THAT, AS ANOTHER GREAT DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT ONCE SAID, ""THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH AMERICA THAT CANNOT BE CURED BY WHAT IS RIGHT WITH AMERICA.""   THAT IS, AFTER ALL, WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE. IT IS WHO WE ARE. AMERICA IS A PROBLEM-SOLVING NATION. IN THIS CAMPAIGN, WE ARE SETTING BOLD, PROGRESSIVE GOALS BACKED UP BY REAL PLANS THAT WILL IMPROVE LIVES, CREATING MORE GOOD JOBS THAT PROVIDE DIGNITY AND PRIDE AND A MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. RAISING WAGES AND REDUCING INEQUALITIES. MAKING SURE ALL OUR KIDS GET A GOOD EDUCATION NO MATTER WHAT ZIP CODE THEY LIVE IN! [CHEERS AND  BUILDING LADDERS OF OPPORTUNITY AND EMPOWERMENT, SO ALL OF OUR PEOPLE CAN GO AS FAR AS THEIR HARD WORK AND TALENT WILL TAKE THEM. LET'S REVITALIZE PLACES THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT AND LEFT BEHIND, FROM INNER CITIES TO COAL COUNTRY TO INDIAN COUNTRY. AND LET'S PUT AMERICANS TO WORK REBUILDING OUR CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING OUR FAILING WATER SYSTEMS LIKE THE ONE IN FLINT, MICHIGAN.   THERE ARE MANY PLACES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY WHERE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ARE AT RISK FROM THE WATER THEY DRINK AND THE AIR THEY BREATHE. LET'S COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND MAKE AMERICA THE CLEAN-ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF THE 21ST CENTURY. LET'S TAKE ON THE CHALLENGE OF SYSTEMIC RACISM, INVEST IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.   AND FINALLY PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM.   AND ONCE AND FOR ALL, LET'S GUARANTEE EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN!   AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP OUR FAMILIES SAFE AND OUR COUNTRY STRONG. AND WE ARE GOING TO DEFEND OUR RIGHTS. CIVIL RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS, WORKERS RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHTS, LGBT RIGHTS, AND RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.   THOSE ARE, AFTER ALL, NEW YORK VALUES. AND THEY ARE AMERICAN VALUES. [CHEERS AND  AND JUST AS WE DID IN THIS PRIMARY CAMPAIGN, WE NEED TO STAND UP FOR THEM THROUGH THE GENERAL ELECTION AND EVERY DAY AFTER THAT.   YOU KNOW, IT IS BECOMING CLEARER THAT THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTIONS OF OUR LIFETIMES. DONALD TRUMP AND TED CRUZ --   ARE PUSHING A VISION FOR AMERICA THAT IS DIVISIVE, AND FRANKLY DANGEROUS. RETURNING TO TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS, OPPOSING ANY INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE, RESTRICTING A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN HEALTH CARE DECISIONS. PROMISING TO ROUND UP MILLIONS OF IMMIGRANTS, THREATENING TO BAN ALL MUSLIMS FROM ENTERING THE COUNTRY.   CLINTON: PLANNING TO TREAT AMERICAN MUSLIMS LIKE CRIMINALS. THESE THINGS GO AGAINST EVERYTHING AMERICA STANDS FOR. AND WE HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT VISION. IT IS ABOUT LIFTING EACH OTHER UP, NOT TEARING EACH OTHER DOWN.   SO INSTEAD OF BUILDING WALLS, WE ARE GOING TO BREAK DOWN BARRIERS. AND IN THIS CAMPAIGN, I HAVE SEEN AGAIN OUR REMARKABLE DIVERSITY AND DETERMINATION. THIS IS A STATE AND A COUNTRY OF BIGHEARTED, OPEN-MINDED, STRAIGHT TALKING, HARD-WORKING PEOPLE. [CHEERS AND  YOU KNOW, LIKE JOHN, THE FIREFIGHTER FROM THE SOUTH BRONX THAT I MET SHORTLY AFTER 9/11 AS HE SEARCHED FOR SURVIVORS AT GROUND ZERO. AND LIKE SO MANY OTHERS, JOHN GOT SICK FROM BREATHING THE TOXIC AIR. WHEN WE MET AGAIN LAST WEEK, HE GAVE ME A REPLICA OF HIS FDNY BADGE AND THANKED ME FOR HELPING OUR FIRST RESPONDERS GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED. WE HAVE TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR JOHN AND ALL OF OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND OUR POLICE OFFICERS OUR , EMERGENCY RESPONDERS, AND THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO DID SO MUCH FOR US.   OR MAXINE, A 27-YEAR-OLD SINGLE MOM FROM STATEN ISLAND, WHO IS HERE TONIGHT. SHE SHARED WITH ME HOW SHE WORKED HER WAY OUT OF POVERTY, GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE, THANKS IN PART TO THE HELP SHE GOT FOR HER CHILD FROM THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM THAT WE STARTED IN THE 1990'S!   OR MIKEY, WHO SPENT -- IS MIKEY HERE? I WILL TELL YOU, MIKEY SPENT SIX MONTHS IN RIKERS FOR A LOW-LEVEL DRUG OFFENSE. AND HE FOUND OUT HOW HARD IT IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE THEIR TIME TO FIND JOBS WHEN THEY MAKE IT OUT. MIKEY MANAGED TO START HIS OWN ICE CREAM SHOP. I TOOK A LOT OF YOU THERE YESTERDAY. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. AS YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN, I COULD NOT STOP MYSELF FROM EATING IT AS SOON AS I GOT IT. BY THE WAY, HE MADE A CONCOCTION FOR ME CALLED ""VICTORY.""   MIKEY IS ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WHY WE HAVE TO REFORM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.   CLINTON: AND BAN THE BOX SO OTHERS HAVE A FAIR CHANCE TO SUCCEED. NEW YORKERS AND AMERICANS SPEAK EVERY LANGUAGE, FOLLOW EVERY FAITH, HAIL FROM EVERY CONTINENT. OUR DIVERSITY IS ONE OF OUR GREATEST STRENGTHS IN THE 21ST CENTURY, NOT A WEAKNESS. AS ROBERT KENNEDY, WHOSE SENATE SEAT I WAS HONORED TO HOLD, ONCE SAID, ""WE ARE A GREAT COUNTRY, AN UNSELFISH COUNTRY, AND A COMPASSIONATE COUNTRY."" AND NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE TELLS YOU OR WHAT YOU MIGHT HEAR FROM OTHERS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, THAT IS STILL TRUE TODAY.   AMERICA IS GREAT. AND WE CAN DO GREAT THINGS IF WE DO THEM TOGETHER.   SO, PLEASE JOIN US. TEXT TO JOIN, GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM. BE PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN. I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE GET THE CAMPAIGN'S RESOURCES FROM PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU WHO GO IN AND CHIP IN $5, $25. I AM GRATEFUL TO EVERY ONE OF YOU. AND TO THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAVE WORKED YOUR HEARTS OUT --   TO THE COMMUNITY LEADERS, MEMBERS OF THE STATE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, COUNTY EXECUTIVES, MAYORS OF CITIES LARGE AND SMALL, AND TO THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK, AND OUR BOROUGH PRESIDENT, AND OUR CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS. AND TO OUR GOVERNOR, OUR SENATORS, OUR CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATES. AND ALL MY FRIENDS ACROSS THIS WONDERFUL STATE OF HOURS, THANK YOU. WE ARE GOING TO GO UP AGAINST SOME POWERFUL FORCES THAT WILL DO, SAY, AND SPEND WHATEVER IT TAKES TO STOP US, BUT REMEMBER, IT IS NOT WHETHER YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN, IT IS WHETHER YOU GET BACK UP.   CLINTON: AND FINALLY, LET ME SAY THIS. THERE IS A REMARKABLE YOUNG WOMAN HERE TONIGHT. HER NAME IS ERICA. SHE LIVES THE TRUTH OF WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING EVERY DAY. ERICA'S MOTHER WAS THE PRINCIPLE OF SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. AND SHE DIED TRYING TO PROTECT HER CHILDREN, HER STUDENTS. ERICA WAS DEVASTATED, AS ANY FAMILY MEMBER IS. AND SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE LIFE WITHOUT HER MOM. BUT THEN, SHE GOT THINKING. SHE GOT BACK UP. SHE HAD NEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN POLITICS BEFORE. SHE HAS MADE IT HER MISSION TO ADVOCATE FOR COMMONSENSE GUN SAFETY REFORM.   LIKE THE MOTHERS OF ERIC GARDNER -- ERIC GARNER AND TRAYVON MARTIN, ERICA HAS TURNED HER MOURNING INTO A MOVEMENT, AND IT IS NOT EASY. AS SHE SAID THE OTHER DAY, WHAT IF EVERYONE WHO FACED TOUGH ODDS SAID, IT IS HARD SO I'M GOING TO WALK AWAY? THAT IS NOT THE TYPE OF WORLD THAT I WANT TO LIVE IN. ERICA, IT IS NOT THE TYPE OF WORLD WE WANT TO LIVE IN, AND WE REFUSE TO LIVE IN THAT.   SO MY FRIENDS, THAT IS THE SPIRIT THAT MAKES THIS COUNTRY GREAT. NEW YORKERS PULLED TOGETHER AND REBUILD OUR CITY AFTER THE WORST TERRORIST ATTACK IN OUR HISTORY, AND HOW AMERICANS WORKED OUR WAY BACK FROM THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS IN OUR LIFETIME. WE ARE GOING TO BREAK DOWN ALL THE BARRIERS HOLDING US BACK. THE MOTTO OF THIS STATE IS EXCELSIOR OR, EVER UPWARD. LET'S WIN THIS ELECTION AND ALL RISE TOGETHER. THANK YOU SO MUCH.   >>  LET'S HEAR IT FOR NEW YORK WHERE DREAMS ARE MADE OF, THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T DO COUNT ON NEW YORK THESE LIGHTS WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BRAND-NEW, THE LIGHTS WILL INSPIRE YOU LET'S HEAR IT FOR NEW YORK I REMEMBER WHEN DREAMS ARE MADE OF, THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T DO COUNT ON NEW YORK THESE STREETS WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BRAND-NEW, THE LIGHTS WILL INSPIRE YOU LET'S HEAR IT FOR NEW YORK REMEMBER WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF , THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T DO COUNT ON NEW YORK THE STREETS WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BRAND-NEW, THE LIGHTS WILL INSPIRE YOU LET'S HEAR IT FOR NEW YORK, NEW YORK, NEW YORK    REMEMBER WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T DO  COUNT ON NEW YORK THESE STREETS WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BRAND-NEW, THESE LIGHTS WILL INSPIRE YOU LET'S HEAR IT FOR NEW YORK REMEMBER WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T DO COUNT ON NEW YORK THESE STREETS WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BRAND-NEW, THESE LIGHTS WILL INSPIRE YOU LET'S HEAR IT FOR NEW YORK REMEMBER WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T DO COUNT ON NEW YORK THE STREETS WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BRAND-NEW, THESE LIGHTS WILL INSPIRE YOU LET'S HEAR IT FOR NEW YORK REMEMBER WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T DO COUNT ON NEW YORK THE STREETS WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BRAND-NEW, THESE LIGHTS WILL INSPIRE YOU LET'S HEAR IT FOR NEW YORK, NEW YORK, NEW YORK   [CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE,",Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton New York Primary Night Speech

SOME BEHIND ME, SOME AROUND ME. I WANT TO THANK MARY FOR INTRODUCING ME BUT MORE THAN THAT I WANT TO THANK HER FOR BEING A STRONG VOICE ON BEHALF OF WORKING WOMEN AND ESPECIALLY WOMEN WHO HAVE THE PROTECTION OF A UNION TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE TREATED RIGHT. AND, I AM ALWAYS HAPPY TO BE ANYWHERE WITH CECILE RICHARDS. WHO HAS BEEN AT A FIERCE, EFFECTIVE FIGHTER FOR ALL OF US. WOMEN AND MEN. BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU, WHEN THE OPPOSITION ORGANIZES TO GO AFTER ONE OF US, THEY ARE REALLY GOING AFTER ALL OF US. THEY HAVE GONE AFTER IT TO UNDERMINE THE AMERICAN LABOR MOVEMENT. THEY HAVE GONE AFTER PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND THE WORK IT HAS DONE. AND AT THE VERY BASIC CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS GRANTED TO WOMEN UNDER ROE. V. WADE TO MAKE THE MOST PERSONAL DECISION ABOUT HEALTH CARE CHOICES. AND I CANNOT THANK ENOUGH MY FRIEND, ANOTHER WOMAN OF COURAGE , FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN GABBY FURRED FOR BEING HERE. -- GABBY GIFFORD FOR BEING HERE. >> CHANTING ""BGABBY."" MRS. CLINTON: SHE AND HER WONDERFUL HUSBAND, MARK KELLY, HAVE BEEN ON A MISSION. A MISSION TO BRING ABOUT COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY REFORM. AND TO GATHER WE ARE GOING TO ACCOMPLISH THAT MISSION. AND FINALLY, I WANT TO THANK HIM TO REALLY SALUTE MY FRIEND AND SENATE TOUR FROM NEW YORK, KIERSTEN GILLIBRAND, WHO HAS TAKEN ON SOME VERY DIFFICULT ISSUES IN THE SENATE FOR ALL OF US. FOR ALL OF US, BUT PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN. SHE HAS BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES DAY AFTER DAY MAKING CHANGE. SHE KNOWS YOU DO NOT GET UP AND MAKE HIS SPEECH AND HAVE EVERYTHING CHANGE. SHE KNOWS YOU HAVE GOT TO WORK EVERY SINGLE HOUR OF EVERY SINGLE DAY. LIKE ME, SHE IS A PROGRESSIVE WHO LIKES TO GET THINGS DONE FOR THE PEOPLE SHE REPRESENTS. NOW, IT IS VERY EXCITING TO BE WITH ALL OF YOU ON THE EVENING OF THE NEW YORK PRIMARY. I AM SO GREAT ALL FOR THE CHANCE I HAD TO REPRESENT THIS STATE FOR EIGHT YEARS. THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK TOOK A CHANCE ON ME IN 2000. YOU SENT ME TO THE SENATE. WE WORKED TOGETHER. WE DEALT WITH THE HORROR OF 9/11 TOGETHER. WE WORKED TOGETHER ON INNER-CITY AREAS AND UPSTATE RURAL AREAS AND IT WAS THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE TO REPRESENT YOU IN THE SENATE AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT NEW YORK HAD MY BACK AND I ALWAYS TRIED TO HAVE YOUR BACK AND I WILL AGAIN IF I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ELECTED YOUR PRESIDENT.   >> CROWD CHANTING ""HILLARY"" MRS. CLINTON: I AM FOCUSED ON THE ISSUES THAT REALLY MATTER TO EVERYBODY. TO SOME IT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT -- MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THEM THEY ARE INTERLOCKING. THEY'RE LOOKING AT WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO PRODUCE POSITIVE RESULTS IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO DEFEND THE RIGHTS WE ALREADY HAVE AGAINST A CONCERTED ASSAULT ON EVERY ONE OF THEM. THEY ARE ABOUT TO WHETHER WE WILL BE UNITED AS A COUNTRY OR CONTINUE TO BE DIVIDED BY THOSE WHO GAIN FROM THAT DIVISION. SO LET ME JUST SPEND A COUPLE MINUTES TALKING ABOUT HOW CONNECT DID THIS ALL IS. I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT WOMEN'S ISSUES BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND HOW I SEE THEM AND HOW COMMITTED I AM TO MAKING THE CASE THAT WHEN WE TAKE A RIGHT FROM SOMEONE, WHEN WE ERODED, WHEN WE MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EXERCISE THEN WE HEARD EVERYBODY. NOT JUST THOSE DIRECTLY AFFECT IT. THINK WITH ME ABOUT THE KIND OF AMERICA WE WANT TO CREATE TOGETHER. IMAGINE A TOMORROW WHERE WE HAVE ENOUGH GOOD JOBS WITH GREAT INCOMES. EVERYBODY GETS A RAISE. EVERYBODY WHO WORKS HARD GETS REWARDED. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN? IT HAPPENS BY MAKING SURE THE GOVERNMENT IS PLAYING A ROLE IN IN CREATING THOSE JOBS ADVANCED MANUFACTURING. CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY. SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE WILL GROW AND CREATE MORE JOBS FROM. THIS IS NOT A PIPE DREAM, MY FRIENDS. THIS IS DOABLE. WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE UP OUR MINDS WE WILL HAVE AN ELECTION ABOUT IT. IT IS EASY TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEMS FACING AMERICA. WE MUTE -- WE NEED SOLUTIONS THAT WE WORK TOGETHER ON. THAT IS WHY THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN I HAVE BEEN LAYING OUT THE PLANS FOR HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS. WHAT WE WILL ACHIEVE TOGETHER. I KNOW SOME PEOPLE WILL HAVE COMMENTED. I CAN PAY ATTENTION. ON VERY LITTLE SLEEP. BUT NEVERTHELESS, I DO. SOME PEOPLE HAVE COMMENTED, ENOUGH WITH THE PLANS, HILLARY. WE DO NOT WHAT YOUR NAME OR PLANS. JUST GO OUT AND MAKE SPEECHES. DO NOT TALK TO LOUDLY. BUT DO NOT TALK TO SOFTLY. WELL, LOOK I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT FOR ME THIS ELECTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT ME. IT IS ABOUT IN AGENDA THAT WE PRESENT TO NEW YORK TOMORROW. THAT WE PRESENT TO THE COUNTRY. THAT WE VOTE ON. IS THAT WILL GIVE US A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE PROGRESS WE ALL WANT TO SEE. AND WHAT I AM FOCUSED ON IS BREAKING DOWN THE BARRIERS THAT STAND IN THE WAY OF PEOPLE GETTING AHEAD AND STAYING AHEAD. OF COURSE THERE ARE ECONOMIC THEIR, THAT HAS TO BE ONE OF OUR HIGHEST PRIORITIES. CREATING THOSE JOBS. RAISING THE INCOME. RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. IT ABSOLUTELY HAS TO BE AT THE TOP OF OUR LIST BUT YOU KNOW, ECONOMIC BARRIERS ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT AMERICANS ARE FACING TODAY. TAKE THE ISSUE OF EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. IF IT WERE JUST AN ECONOMIC BARRIER WE WOULD NOT STILL BE TALKING ABOUT IT. BUT IT IS MORE THAN THAT. WHEN YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AND COMPARE WHY WOMEN ARE STILL NOT BEING PAID IT WILL LEAVE FOR THE WORK WE DO, SOME OF IT IS JUST NOT EXPLAINABLE OTHER THAN IT GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED DISCRIMINATION. WHAT YOU HEARD CECILE SAY IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THERE IS NO WOMAN'S DISCOUNT WHEN WE GO TO CHECK OUT AT THE SUPERMARKET COUNTER. I HAVE BEEN SHOPPING A LONG TIME. AND, I HAVE NEVER BEEN LOOKED AT BY A CASHIER AND SAID, OK YOU ARE A WHITE WOMAN. YOU ONLY HAVE TO PAY $.78. OR MY FRIENDS, YOU ARE BLACK, YOU ARE LATINO, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY THE FULL FREIGHT. YOU CAN PAY $.65 OR $.55. THAT NEVER HAPPENS. THIS IS NOT JUST A WOMAN'S ISSUE THIS IS A FAMILY ISSUE. IF YOU HAVE A WOMAN, A WIFE, A SISTER, A DAUGHTER WHO ARE WORKING THEN YOU HAVE A STAKE IN MAKING SURE THEY ARE PAID EQUALLY. AND, WHEN YOU TAKE ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS AN OUR COUNTRY, THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, IN FACT DOING MUCH BETTER ECONOMICALLY THE AND ANYBODY ELSE RIGHT NOW, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO BE ABLE TO BALANCE WORK AND THE FAMILY YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY ARE WE DOING THIS TO EACH OTHER? EVERY OTHER ADVANCED ECONOMY HAS FIGURED OUT HOW TO HAVE FAMILY LEAVE. PAID FAMILY LEAVE. I STARTED WORKING ON FAMILY LEAVE WAY BACK IN THE 1980'S AND I WAS THRILLED WHEN MY HUSBAND PASSED A BILL WHICH HAD BEEN VETOED TWICE BY PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH. LET'S NOT FORGET, THIS IS NOT AGENT HISTORY. -- ANCIENT ROMAN HISTORY. BILL BECAME PRESIDENT, CONGRESS PASSED IT, SEND IT TO HIM, AND 200 MILLION PLUS PEOPLE OF TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IT SO THAT WAS A GOOD FIRST STEP. BUT, TOO MANY PEOPLE COULD NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. THEY COULD NOT TAKE OFF TIME THEY WERE NOT PAID FOR. THAT NEW BABY, THAT'S SICK SPOUSE, THAT AILING MOTHER OR RENT PARENT, THEY COULD NOT TAKE TIME OFF. IT IS TIME FOR US. AND KIERSTEN HAS BEEN A LEADER ON THIS. IT IS TIME FOR US FINALLY TO PASS PAID FAMILY LEAVE. IN TIME WILL TELL YOU, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS MOVING FORWARD IN THE STATES. I WANT TO APPLAUD NEW YORK, APPLIED CALIFORNIA WHICH HAS BEEN DOING IT FOR MORE THAN 10 YEARS. IT DOES YOUR PRESIDENT, WE ARE GOING TO DELIVER ON PAID FAMILY LEAVE FOR THE FAMILIES OF AMERICA. WE ALSO HAVE TO REALLY FOCUS ON EDUCATION. AGAIN, THAT IS AN ISSUE FOR EVERYBODY. THAT IS WHY I WANT EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION FOR EVERYBODY AND I WANT TO THANK SHIRLEY MCRAE AND MAYOR DEFAZIO FOR MAKING SURE THAT NEW YORK CITY HAS UNIVERSAL PRE-TAPE. THIS IS AN ISSUE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE HONOR AND TO NURTURE THE POTENTIAL OF EVERYONE. I THINK THAT IS WHAT AMERICA SHOULD BE ABOUT. EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO THEIR POTENTIAL AND LEARNING STARTS IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS. IN ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL, I INTEND TO BE A GOOD PARTNER WITH AMERICA'S TEACHERS TO SUPPORT OUR EDUCATORS TO MAKE SURE WE ARE DOING WHAT WILL WORK TO LIFT OUR CHILDREN. AND, LET'S SPEND MORE TIME TRYING TO ENCOURAGE MP, PARTICULARLY YOUNGER GIRLS TO GO INTO THE STEM COURSES. SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS. THERE ARE SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE NOT BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND AGAIN, 30 PLUS YEARS AGO WE HAD A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE WITH DEGREES IN COMPUTER SCIENCES. WHAT HAPPENED? SOME OF WHAT HAPPENED IS THE WAY WOMEN WERE TREATED IN THE WORK FORCE WHEN THEY GOT INTO TECH KNOWLEDGE HE. RIGHT NOW WE KNOW, LOOKING AT SALARIES AND PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES, IT IS NOT EQUAL. SO WHILE WE ENCOURAGE MORE YOUNG WOMEN TO PURSUE THESE CAREERS, WE WILL GET MORE TRANSPARENCY AND COMMITMENT FROM COMPANIES TO TREAT MEN AND WOMEN EQUALLY AS THEY HIRE, AS THEY PROMOTE, AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYBODY IN A WAY THAT WILL ACT JULIE WORKED TO SEND MIDDLE CLASS, WORKING, AND POOR KIDS TO SCHOOL. IN WE'RE GOING TO TACKLE THE STUDENT DEBT PROBLEM WHICH IS BURDENING SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE. WE WANT MORE NATIONAL SERVICE SO THAT YOUNG PEOPLE CAN PERFORM NATIONAL SERVICE AND ACTUALLY GET A FREE RIDE OR A TOTALLY DISCOUNTED RIDE OR GET THEIR DEBTS FORGIVEN FOR PERFORMING THAT KIND OF WORK. AND, WE ARE GOING TO IMPROVE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. I WILL DEFEND IT IT. IT IS WORKING. WE'VE GOT TO IMPROVE IT AND GET THE COST DOWN. BUT AGAIN, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS HARDLY EVER TALKED ABOUT. IT IS NOT THAT LONG AGO ONE CLINICAL TRIALS ABOUT HOW TO TREAT DISEASES, INCLUDING BREAST CANCER, WERE ONLY DONE ON MEN. I KNOW A LOT OF YOUNGER PEOPLE MUST HE SHOCKED TO HEAR THAT. I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I FIRST HEARD THAT. WE HAD TO CHANGE A LOT AND NOW WE HAVE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND ONE OF THE GREAT CHANGES WAS TO ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE THAT WOMEN WOULD NO LONGER PAY MORE FOR HEALTH INSURANCE THE END MEN. SO ALL OF THESE BATTLES, YOU HAVE GOT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HERE ARE WAGING THESE BATTLES. MY GREAT FRIEND, CONGRESSWOMAN CAROLYN MALONEY HAS BEEN ON THE FRONT LINE. CONGRESSWOMAN SHEILA JACKSON LEE HAS BEEN WAVING THE BANNER HIGH. I KNOW IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THERE WAS EVER A TIME LIKE THIS, WE DO NOT WANT TO GO BACK. THAT IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE HAVE COME TO PROTECT THE GAINS WE HAVE MADE. AND WE STILL HAVE DISPARITY IN HEALTH CARE TREATMENT BETWEEN MEN IN WOMEN BUT ALSO PARTICULARLY ON THE BASIS OF INCOME AND ACCESS AND WE ARE GOING TO TACKLE THAT AND GET THE COST OF RESTRICTION DROPPED DOWN FOR EVERYBODY. AND, LET'S FINALLY MAKE A COMMITMENT TO TREATING MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM LIKE THE HEALTH CARE ISSUES THEY REPRESENT AND LET'S DO WHAT MORE --     MRS. CLINTON AND, LET'S DO MORE TO TREAT ADDICTION. LET'S DO MORE TO SAVE LIVES. THERE IS EXCITING WORK AHEAD OF US AND TACTICALLY EVERYTHING I SAID IS OPPOSED BY THE REPUBLICANS. THEY DO NOT THINK WE NEED TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. DONALD TRUMP SAYS WAGES ARE TOO HIGH AND AMERICA RIGHT NOW. THEY DO NOT BELIEVE EQUAL PAY AS A PROBLEM. THEY DO NOT WANT TO MOVE TOWARD PAID FAMILY LEAVE. THIS IS NOT JUST A FREE CHOICE. THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR HOW WE VOTE AND THE AGENDA WE PUT FORWARD. AND THE OTHER POINT ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE REPUBLICANS, AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER IS THAT THEY WANT TO STRIP US OF THE RIGHTS WE HAVE. I STAND IN OPPOSITION. I WILL DEFEND A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN HEALTH CARE DECISIONS AND I WILL DEFEND LAND PARENTHOOD.  MRS. CLINTON: I WAS HONORED TO RECEIVE THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD ACTION FUND AND THE OTHER AND DORIS MET BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES ON BEHALF OF OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS FOR A LONG TIME. AND WHEN TRUMP SAID WHAT HE SAID ABOUT PUNISHING WOMEN, I WAS APPALLED. THAT IS A CORE ISSUE AND WHEN HE SAID IT WAS A DISTRACTION, THAT HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE REAL ISSUES, I WAS APPALLED AGAIN. THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THE IN DEFENDING OUR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THIS IS A HUMAN RIGHT. AND MAYBE, MAYBE IF SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE EITHER THINK IT IS A DISTRACTION OR WANT TO REVERSE IT MAYBE IF THEY WENT TO SOME OF THE PLACES I HAVE BEEN IN SEEN HOW THAT IS VIEWED TO SUPPRESS WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND THEIR AUTONOMY AND WHERE THE GOVERNMENT MAKES DECISIONS, THE CONSEQUENCES ARE HORRIBLE. WHETHER IT IS CHINESE GOVERNMENT POLICY OR ONE CHILD AND FORCED ABORTIONS AND STERILIZATION OR THE POLICIES OF THE COMMUNIST REGIME IN ROMANIA WITH FORCED CHILDBEARING, WE CANNOT. WE MUST NOT EVER LET GOVERNMENTS AND POLITICIANS MAKE THOSE DECISIONS AND AS LONG AS I AM AROUND, WE NEVER WILL. . MRS. CLINTON: AND I TELL YOU, I WILL ALSO DEFEND MARRIAGE INEQUALITY AND WILL WORK ON DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY. WE ARE GOING TO WORK ON AND PASS THE QUALITY WHEN I AM PRESIDENT. I WILL DEFEND VOTING RIGHTS AND WORK TO REVERSE AND END CITIZENS UNITED. I WILL DEFEND THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN AND THE RIGHT OF UNIONS TO REPRESENT PEOPLE LIKE MARY. THE AMERICAN LABOR MOVEMENT HELPED TO BUILD THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS AND THOSE WHO HAVE FORGOTTEN IT ARE UNDERMINING WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE REPRESENTED. I STOPPED AT A CAR WASH IN QUEENS ON THE WAY HERE BECAUSE THE CAR WASHERS HAVE BEEN UNIONIZING. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY ARE GETTING A DECENT SALARY. THEY ARE GETTING BENEFITS. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO IS GIVE EVERYONE THE COMMITTEE AND PURPOSE A JOB BRINGS. A JOB WHERE THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING, TO PROVIDE A GOOD MIDDLE-CLASS LIFESTYLE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO FIGHT FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. I HAVE SAID I WILL START THIS WORK IMMEDIATELY UPON BECOMING RESIDENT, AND I WILL.  MRS. CLINTON: THANK YOU. I AM SO PROUD OF NEW YORK. LADY LIBERTY STANDS AN HOUR HARBOR. WE ARE A CITY OF IMMIGRANTS, A STATE OF IMMIGRANTS, AND A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS. IN GS, WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT TOGETHER TO TAKE ON THE GUN LOBBY FOR COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY REFORM.  MRS. CLINTON THIS IS IN ISSUE THAT KNOWS NO BOUNDARIES. I HAVE KNOWN TOO MANY PEOPLE, FATHERS AND MOTHERS, SIBLINGS, CHILDREN, CLOSE FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES WHO HAVE LOST PEOPLE ON AVERAGE, 90 PEOPLE A DAY ARE KILLED AND AMERICA. THAT IS 33,000 PEOPLE PER YEAR. AND, THERE ARE MANY POWERFUL LOBBIES IN WASHINGTON. AS I SAID IN THE DEBATE THE OTHER NIGHT IN BROOKLYN, I SAID, LOOK, BERNIE SANDERS TALKS A LOT ABOUT THE GREED AND RECKLESSNESS ON WALL STREET. I HAVE THE TOUGHEST LANDS. THEY KNOW IT BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO BEAT ME. RUNNING ADS, FORMING HEDGE RUNS. THERE ARE GOOD AT MAKING THEIR ASSESSMENT AND THEY KNOW I AM TROUBLE FOR THEM. SO I AGREE WITH THAT. SO, WHAT ABOUT THE GREED AND RECKLESSNESS OF THE GUN MANUFACTURERS AND SELLERS? I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT WHEN SENATOR SANDERS SAID THE PARENTS OF THE SANDY HOOK CHILDREN DID NOT DESERVE THEIR DAY IN COURT LARGELY BECAUSE HE VOTED FOR THE BILL THAT GAVE SPECIAL TO ACTIONS, IMMUNITY FROM LIABILITY TO THE GUN MAKERS AND SELLERS. I WAS IN THE SENATE AT THE SAME TIME. SO WAS BARACK OBAMA. I VOTED AGAINST IT, BARACK OBAMA VOTED AGAINST IT, BERNIE SANDERS VOTED OR IT. THIS HAS GOT TO BE A VOTING ISSUE. WE HAVE GOT TO ORGANIZE OURSELVES TO TAKE ON THIS POWERFUL LOBBY. THEY KNOW I AM COMING AFTER THEM. THEY ARE ALREADY COMING AFTER ME AND I CONSIDER THAT A BADGE OF HONOR. I WILL STAND WITH GABBY FOR ANY DAY TO TAKE THEM ON. SO, MY FRIENDS, WE HAVE WORK TO DO. I SEE THE FOLKS FROM TAKE A STAND. WE ARE TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MAKE SURE WE KEEP THE TRUST FUND GOING. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. I CANNOT DO ANY OF THAT WORK WITHOUT YOU AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE TEST THE NEXT PRESIDENT FACES, THE FIRST ONE IS, CAN YOU PRODUCE POSITIVE RESULTS. THE SECOND IS, CAN YOU PROTECT US AND YOU KNOW THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM TRUMP AND CRUISE IS NOT ONLY OFFENSIVE, IT IS DANGEROUS. WHEN DONALD TRUMP SAYS, NO MUSLIMS CAN COME TO AMERICA, A NATION FOUNDED ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IN CASE HE HAD NOT BEEN TAUGHT THAT. THAT DOES NOT ONLY OFFEND US, IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. IF WE ARE GOING TO DEFEAT TERRORISM AND ISIS AND PARTICULAR WE NEED A COALITION OF NATIONS TO STAND WITH US TO MAKE SURE WE AND THE THREATS COMING FROM THEM. I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO CREATE A COALITION BECAUSE I DID CREATE THE COALITION THAT IMPOSED SANCTIONS ON IRAN, INCLUDING DINA AND RUSSIA WHICH FORCED THEM TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE AND I KNOW IT IS HARD AND IT DOES ON HELPED HIM SOME BUT HE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND SALTING THE RELIGION OF A NUMBER OF THE NATIONS WE NEED IN THE COALITION TO HELP US TO EAT ACES IN THE FIRST PLACE -- TO HELP US DEFEAT ISIS IN THE FIRST PLACE. PROFILING THE RELIGION OF AMERICAN MUSLIMS IS BEYOND ABSURD AND THAT IS WHAT THE CHIEF OF THE NYPD SAID. WELL, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH THE 1000 POLICE OFFICERS IN NEW YORK WHO ARE AMERICAN MUSLIMS? AND, COMMISSIONER BILL BRADLEY SUMMED IT UP BY SAYING, TED CRUZ DOES NOT KNOW WHAT THE HELL HE IS TALKING ABOUT. SO, YES, WE HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND WE HAVE DULY THE WORLD IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR VALUES AND LIGHTLY, WE HAVE TO UNIFY OUR COUNTRY. THERE'S IS TOO MUCH DEMAGOGUERY AND HATE-FILLED SPEECH GOING ON. END IT IS JUST SO IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE PEOPLE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WOULD BE SAYING WHAT THEY ARE SAYING. IN CITING VIOLENCE BETWEEN HIM AND HIM ON AMERICANS. I WILL GO ANYWHERE, ANYTIME TO MEET WITH ANYBODY TO FIND COMMON GROUND. WE WILL FIND THAT COMMON GROUND. WE WILL FIND THOSE SOLUTIONS. WHAT I WILL ALSO STAND MY GROUND ON YOUR BEHALF. PROTECTING YOUR RIGHTS, MAKING SURE WE ARE MOVING FORWARD TOGETHER. YOU KNOW, THERE IS A LOT THAT IS SPECIAL FOR ME ABOUT THIS PRIMARY TOMORROW BECAUSE I DID RUN HERE AND BECAUSE YOU WERE ALSO SUPPORTIVE BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE I WANT TO END WITH. YOU KNOW, THE FIRST STATEMENT EVER RECORDED IN HUMAN HISTORY THAT SET FORTH A RATIONALE FOR WOMEN TO HAVE RIGHTS HAPPENED IN SENECA FALLS, NEW YORK. SUSAN B ANTHONY, ELIZABETH CADY STANTON, FREDERICK DOUGLASS WHO JOINED FORCES WITH WOMEN. WHO WERE CLAIMING THAT THEY, TOO, SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO VOTE. THAT THEY, TOO, SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO SERVE ON JURIES TO BE FULL CITIZENS. THAT IS DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS. YOU CAN GOOGLE IT LATER AS I AM SURE YOU WILL. THAT KICKED OFF THE SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT. AND, AGAIN, IT DID NOT COME EASILY. THERE WERE PROTESTS. DEMONSTRATIONS. EVENTUALLY, WOMEN CHAINING THEMSELVES TO THE FENCE AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE. GOING TO PRISON. GOING ON HUNGER STRIKES TO CLAIM THE RIGHT TO VOTE. AND YES, EVEN TO A THAT WAS GRANTED. WE WILL CELEBRATE THE 100 ANNIVERSARY IN 2020. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE SACRIFICES OF THE SUFFRAGETTES, WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE SACRIFICES OF THE LEADERS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENTS, WHEN I THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO WERE SACRIFICED FOR TRYING TO DO OTHER THINGS, STARTING IN THE 19TH CENTURY AND GOING INTO THE 20TH CENTURY, TO MAKE A VERY SIMPLE CLAIM ON THE IDEA THAT WE ARE ALL CREATED EQUAL. WE ALL HAVE A RIGHT TO LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN AMERICA. THIS IS WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT. PLEASE, VOTE TOMORROW. BRING EVERYBODY YOU KNOW. LET'S STAND TOGETHER FOR THE FUTURE OF AMERICA. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.        >>",Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally in Manhattan

THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WOW. I AM THRILLED TO BE HERE AT CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY. AND TO BE IN THIS GREAT AMERICAN CITY, AS THE MAYOR SO RIGHTLY SAID. A CITY THAT HAS NOT ONLY BUILT BRIDGES BUT ROADS INTO THE FUTURE, DEMONSTRATING ABSOLUTELY THAT YOU CAN HAVE RESILIENCE IF YOU ARE RESOURCEFUL, IF YOU DO NOT GIVE UP, YOU KEEP WORKING TOGETHER. WE CAN MAKE IT HERE IN PITTSBURGH AND AMERICA.   COME OUT OF A TRADITION OF AMERICAN PROGRESSIVEISM THAT BELIEVES WITH ALL OUR HEARTS THAT WE ARE ONE COUNTRY, ONE PEOPLE, ONE FUTURE. AND WE HAVE TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER, LIFT EACH OTHER UP. WE HAVE TO RESPECT EACH OTHER. WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE -- BY WHAT WE DO, THAT OUR DIVERSE CITY IS AN ASSET.   IT MAKES US THE LUCKIEST NATION IN THE WORLD TO HAVE THE TALENT, THE DREAMS, THE ASPIRATIONS, OF COUNTLESS PEOPLE. WHAT I WANT TO DO, IF I AM SO FORTUNATE AS TO BE PRESIDENT, IS KNOCKED DOWN EVERY BARRIER THAT STANDS IN THE WAY OF ANY AMERICAN BEING ABLE TO FULFILL HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. EVERY AMERICAN DESERVES THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF A PERSONAL FUTURE THAT WILL HELP US BUILD AMERICA'S FUTURE. I HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR IN THIS CAMPAIGN. I TAKE A BACKSEAT TO NOBODY.   WHEN IT COMES TO BEING A PROGRESSIVE, BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IF YOU ARE A PROGRESSIVE, YOU NEED TO MAKE PROGRESS. YOU NEED TO GET THINGS DONE. YOU NEED TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. THAT IS WHAT I INTEND TO DO. I THINK THERE ARE THREE BIG TESTS THE NEXT PRESIDENT HAS TO MEET. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, YOU ARE ACTUALLY DOING A BIG JOB INTERVIEW. YOU WANT TO KNOW, WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? WHERE DO THEY COME FROM? WHAT DO THEY BELIEVE? WHAT HAVE THEY DONE IN THE PAST? WHAT HAVE THEY NOT JUST SAID, BUT WHAT HAVE THEY ACCOMPLISHED? [CHEERS AND  AND CAN WE COUNT ON THEM, CAN WE COUNT ON THEM TO STAND UP FOR AMERICANS AND AMERICA? SO HERE ARE THESE TESTS. NUMBER ONE, CAN THE NEXT PRESIDENT ACTUALLY DELIVER RESULTS THAT MAKE DIFFERENCES, POSITIVE DIFFERENCES, IN THE LIVES OF AMERICANS OF ALL AGES? YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ASK THAT. ONE OF THE WAYS YOU LOOK IS, WHAT HAVE YOU GONE ALREADY? WHO HAVE YOU HELPED? WHO HAVE YOU FOUGHT FOR? WHO HAVE YOU TAKEN ON? WHO HAVE USED IT UP AGAINST -- STOOD UP AGAINST? THE SECOND TEST IS, CAN YOU KEEP US SAFE AND CONTINUE TO LEAD THE WORLD ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN VALUES? THE THIRD IS, CAN YOU UNIFY AMERICA? CAN YOU BRING US TOGETHER, END THE DIVISIVENESS THAT HAS BECOME ALL TOO COMMON IN OUR POLITICS? SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT PRODUCING RESULTS, I THINK ABOUT MY GRANDFATHER, WHO CAME WITH HIS FAMILY AS A YOUNG IMMIGRANT TO NORTHEAST PENNSYLVANIA, TO SCRANTON. I THINK ABOUT HOW HE WENT TO WORK IN THE SCRANTON MILLS WHEN HE WAS STILL A TEENAGER. HE WORKED THERE HIS ENTIRE LIFE. AND HE BUILT A GOOD, MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE IN THOSE TIMES FOR HIS THREE SONS. AND THEN, HIS SONS WENT TO COLLEGE. PENN STATE.   AND WHEN THEY GOT OUT OF COLLEGE -- I KNOW, IT IS A LITTLE UP THE ROAD -- WHEN THEY GOT OUT OF COLLEGE, THEY HAD A BETTER FUTURE. MY DAD WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN. MY MOM HAD A TOUGH UPBRINGING, BUT SHE GOT THROUGH IT, AND SHE SHOWED RESILIENCE AND GRIT THAT WAS SUCH A GREAT EXAMPLE TO ME. EVERY ONE OF US HAS A STORY. YOUR OWN FAMILIES, YOU HAVE SEEN THE STRUGGLES. MAYBE NOT IN YOUR TIME, BUT IN THE PRIOR GENERATION. WHAT HAS BEEN SO EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT AMERICA, THIS AMAZING EXPERIMENT, IS THAT WE DELIVERED. WE WERE NOT PERFECT, AND WE HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS TO OVERCOME. BUT WE DELIVERED AND WE NEVER GAVE UP. AND WE JUST KEPT GOING. YES, SOMETIMES, WE FELL SHORT OF OUR OWN DREAMS. BUT THAT DID NOT STOP US. SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, AS I LOOKED OUT AT ALL OF YOU, PARTICULARLY THOSE OF YOU IN FRONT OF ME, THIS ELECTION IS MUCH MORE ABOUT YOUR FUTURES THAN ANYTHING ELSE. IT IS ABOUT WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU AS YOU MAKE YOUR DECISIONS OVER THE NEXT YEARS AND WHAT KIND OF WORLD WILL BE OUT THERE. I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE WITH ME WHAT WE CAN BUILD TOGETHER. IMAGINE AN ECONOMY THAT CREATES ENOUGH GOOD PAYING JOBS FOR EVERY AMERICAN TO FEEL THAT HE OR SHE COUNTS, TO HAVE THE PURPOSE AND DIGNITY THAT COMES WITH A GOOD JOB, WITH A RISING INCOME.   IMAGINE THAT WE PUT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO WORK AGAIN, FIXING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, OUR ROADS, OUR BRIDGES, OUR TUNNELS, OUR PORT, OUR AIRPORTS. NOT ONLY WHAT WE CAN SEE, BUT WHAT WE CANNOT SEE. NO PERSON IN AMERICA SHOULD EVER DRINK WATER CONTAMINATED BY LEAD OR ANYTHING ELSE.   IMAGINE THAT WE, ONCE AGAIN, BECOME A MANUFACTURING ENGINE OF THE WORLD, THAT WE ARE BUILDING WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS, WHAT IS CREATING OUR FUTURE. I WAS JUST OVER AT THE ROBOTICS INSTITUTE.   AND I SAW THE EXTRAORDINARY WORK THEY ARE DOING IN MEDICINE, IN MANUFACTURING, IN THE KIND OF HOME CARE DELIVERY THAT WILL BE PART OF OUR FUTURE BECAUSE OF THE WORK DONE AT THIS GREAT UNIVERSITY BY THE FACULTY, BY THE STUDENTS.   I WANT US, ONCE AGAIN, TO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN MAKE THE FUTURE BY MAKING THE GOODS THAT WE CAN THEN EXPORT AROUND THE WORLD. I KNOW WE CAN DO THIS BECAUSE NOT ONLY AT THE ROBOTICS INSTITUTE BUT IN MANY PLACES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY, I HAVE SEEN THAT FUTURE. I KNOW WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH. BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE OUR TAX CODE REWARDS THAT KIND OF WORK. WE INVEST IN RESEARCH AGAIN AT THE LEVEL THAT WE SHOULD FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.   SO THAT IS WHY, FOR BOTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND MANUFACTURING, I HAVE LAID OUT VERY SPECIFIC PLANS ON HOW TO DO THIS. WE NEED AN INFRASTRUCTURE BANK THAT CAN CONTINUE TO FUND THE KIND OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN OUR COUNTRY AND, IN MANUFACTURING, I HAVE A $10 BILLION PLAN THAT WILL INVEST IN THE KIND OF INVENTIONS AND PRODUCTIVITY THAT CAN COME RIGHT OUT OF THIS GREAT UNIVERSITY AND PUT PEOPLE TO WORK.   AND I WANT YOU TO JOIN ME IN ONE OF THE GREAT GOALS THAT HAS EVER BEEN SET BY HUMAN BEINGS. AND THAT IS TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND BEGIN TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.   I CARE PASSIONATELY ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THE SCIENTISTS. [CHEERS  AND WHEN YOU ASK THE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE RUNNING, YOU KNOW THEY ALL SAY, THEY ALL SAY, WELL, I AM NOT A SCIENTIST. I BET CARNEGIE MELLON COULD HELP TEACH THEM ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR COUNTRY. BUT IT IS NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE FACE THIS EXIT STENCIL THREAT -- EXISTENTIAL THREAT, BUT THERE ARE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IF WE PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER AND WORK TO CREATE THEM. IN 2009, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I HAD TO CRASH ONE OF THE CONFERENCES AND STALK THE CHINESE AND INDIANS THAT SAID THEY COULD NOT MEET WITH US BECAUSE THEY WERE ON THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT. ON THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT? THE MEETING IS NOT OVER. WE SENT OUT SCOUTS TO THE CONVENTION CENTER. WORD CAME BACK THAT THEY ARE WAY IN THE BACK HAVING A SECRET MEETING. THE PRESIDENT AND I SAID, WELL, I THINK WE WOULD LIKE TO ATTEND. SO OFF WE WENT.   THEY HAD BEEN DODGING AND AVOIDING US FOR DAYS. SO WE MARCHED UP TO THEM AND THE SECURITY GUARDS WERE SAYING, NO, NO, NO, AND PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I KEPT SMILING, HI, HI. THE ROOM WAS COVERED WITH CURTAINS AND YOU COULD NOT SEE WHO WAS IN THERE. THE PRESIDENT PUSHED THROUGH THE SECURITY GUARD'S ARM AND I DUCKED UNDER THE SECURITY GUARD'S ARM. WE GOT INTO THE ROOM, AND THE PRESIDENT SAID, WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU. WE PULLED UP CHAIRS AND SAT DOWN AND SAID, LET'S REACH SOME AGREEMENT SO WE CAN START TO MOVE THE WORLD TOWARDS ACTUALLY FACING UP TO DEALING WITH AND REVERSING THE EFFECTS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.   AND THAT IS WHY I WAS THRILLED WHEN 195 COUNTRIES SIGNED THE AGREEMENT IN PARIS. MY OPPONENT SAID, THAT WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. DO NOT LET PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF GOOD. WE GOT 195 COUNTRIES ON BOARD.   SO NOW, HERE IS OUR CHALLENGE. SOME COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE THE 21ST CENTURY CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER. AS THINGS STAND RIGHT NOW, IT WILL BE GERMANY, CHINA, OR US. I WANT IT TO BE US, AND I WANT CARNEGIE MELLON TO HELP LEAD THE WAY.   I HAVE SET TWO BIG GOALS. I WANT TO HAVE A NORTH AMERICAN CLIMATE AGREEMENT. WE NEED TO BE WORKING WITH CANADA AND MEXICO AS WE REDO OUR GRID. WE NEED TO BE UNDERSTANDING HOW WE ARE GOING TO CHALLENGE STATES , ON TOP OF CLEAN POWER PLANTS, TO GO EVEN FURTHER. I SAID, LET'S HAVE HALF A BILLION MORE SOLAR PANELS DEPLOYED BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM, AND ENOUGH CLEAN ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME BY THE END OF MY SECOND TERM. THESE ARE JOBS THAT HAVE TO BE DONE IN PENNSYLVANIA AND ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. AND THESE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US. I REALLY CHALLENGE ALL OF YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHAT EACH OF YOU CAN DO TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR EFFORTS TO TAKE ON WHAT IS THE 21ST CENTURY GLOBAL CHALLENGE. I BELIEVE THAT, AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THESE BIG OPPORTUNITIES, WE HAVE TO DO MORE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES, ESPECIALLY TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE START THEIR SMALL BUSINESSES, FOLLOW THEIR DREAMS.   I HAVE BEEN TOLD, AND I BELIEVE IT TO BE TRUE THAT CARNEGIE MELLON HAS THE BEST RETURN ON FEDERAL DOLLAR RESEARCH MONEY COMING TO ANY HIGHER-END RESEARCH INSTITUTION IN THE COUNTRY.   AND ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE MADE IT EASIER FOR FACULTY AND GRAD STUDENTS AND MAYBE EVEN UNDERGRADS TO START BUSINESSES. I WANT TO UNLEASH THAT. I WANT TO SEE MILLIONS OF NEW AMERICAN SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT IS WHERE MOST OF THE NEW JOBS WILL COME FROM. SO I WANT TO OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU. I ALSO WANT OUR ECONOMY TO BE FAIRER. IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO WORK FULL-TIME GET PAID A MINIMUM WAGE THAT DOES NOT END UP IN POVERTY AT THE END OF THE YEAR.   AND IMAGINED, IMAGINE, THAT FINALLY, WOMEN GET EQUAL PAY FOR THE WORK WE DO.   THIS IS NOT JUST A WOMEN'S ISSUE. IT IS A FAMILY ISSUE. IF YOU HAVE A WIFE OR A MOTHER OR A SISTER OR A DAUGHTER WHO IS WORKING AND THEY ARE NOT BEING PAID FAIRLY AND EQUALLY, WHEN THEY GO TO THE STORE, WHEN THEY ARE IN THE SUPERMARKET CHECKOUT LINE, THE CASHIER DOES NOT SAY, OK. YOU ONLY HAVE TO PAY $.78 ON THE DOLLAR. OR IF YOU ARE AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN, YOU ONLY HAVE TO PAY $.68 ON THE DOLLAR. IF YOU ARE A LATINO WOMAN, YOU ONLY HAVE TO PAY $.58 ON THE DOLLAR. LAST TIME I CHECKED, THERE WAS NO WOMAN'S DISCOUNT FOR FAILING TO GET EQUAL PAY IN THE FIRST PLACE.   NOW, EVERYTHING I JUST SAID, THE REPUBLICANS ARE AGAINST. EVERY SINGLE THING. YOU KNOW, I AM PROUD THAT WE BROUGHT THE ISSUES TO THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, REPUBLICANS HAVE RUN INSULT- ORIENTED CAMPAIGNS. BUT MAKE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO TAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE. IF THEY GET THE WHITE HOUSE PLUS THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS, WE WILL NOT RECOGNIZE OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTIONS. WE HAVE TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS MADE, AND WE HAVE TO GO FURTHER.   AND HERE IS ONE OF THOSE INCONVENIENT FACTS YOU MIGHT WANT TO SHARE WITH YOUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS. OUR ECONOMY DOES BETTER WHEN WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE.   I MEAN, WE DO NOT HAVE TO GO BACK TO ANCIENT HISTORY. DURING THE 1990'S UNDER MY HUSBAND'S PRESIDENCY --  [CHEERS  AT THE END OF EIGHT YEARS, WE HAD 23 MILLION NEW JOBS, AND INCOME WENT UP FOR EVERYBODY, NOT JUST PEOPLE ON THE TOP. MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES, WORKING FAMILIES, POOR FAMILIES. THE MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME WENT UP 17% IN THOSE EIGHT YEARS. AND THE MEDIAN AFRICAN AMERICAN INCOME WENT UP 33% BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY JOBS. AND WE ENDED UP WITH A BALANCED BUDGET AND SURPLUS. HARD TO BEAT THAT RECORD. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. THE REPUBLICANS, YOU GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR CONSISTENCY. THEY ARE CONSISTENTLY WRONG WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMY. [CHEERS  SO IN COMES GEORGE W. BUSH. I WAS IN THE SENATE, REPRESENTING NEW YORK. I STOOD UP ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND SAID, THEY DO NOT WANT TO TAKE US BACK BEFORE THE CLINTON YEARS. THEY WANT TO TAKE US BACK BEFORE FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT, BEFORE TEDDY ROOSEVELT. THEY WERE SLASHING TAXES. THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY TAKING THEIR EYES OFF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE MORTGAGE MARKETS. AND WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED -- THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. I DO NOT THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA GETS THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR TAKING US OUT OF THE DEBT THE REPUBLICANS PUT US IN.   SO BEWARE. THEY ARE PEDDLING THE SAME ECONOMIC SNAKE OIL. TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS ALL OVER AGAIN. WELL, WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THEM GET AWAY WITH IT. BECAUSE IT MAY BE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THEM, BUT WE HAVE HISTORY, THE FACTS, AND COMMON SENSE ON OUR SIDE. THAT IS WHY I WANT US TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE BUT GO FURTHER. THE KEY TO THE ECONOMY I IMAGINE WE CAN CREATE IS EDUCATION. I THINK WE HAVE TO START WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION.   WHEN I GOT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL, I WENT TO WORK FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. AND WORKING FOR CHILDREN AND GIVING CHILDREN A CHANCE AND EVENING THE ODDS FOR EVERY CHILD IS AT THE CORE OF WHAT I BELIEVE WE MUST DO. FOR ME, MAKING SURE THAT EVERY KID HAS A CHANCE TO FULFILL THAT POTENTIAL IS CRITICAL TO OUR ECONOMY, CRITICAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY. AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED UNIVERSAL PRE-K AND HELP KIDS SO THAT, WHEN THEY GET TO SCHOOL, THEY ARE PREPARED AND READY TO ACTUALLY LEARN. AND WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION, I WANT TO BE A GOOD PARTNER WITH OUR NATION'S PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS. I WANT TO GIVE THEM THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED.   YOU KNOW, BEFORE I CAME OUT HERE, I HAD THE INCREDIBLE HONOR OF MEETING A FAMILY, THE FAMILY OF A YOUNG HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT FROM HERE IN PITTSBURGH, WHO WENT TO WOODLANDS HIGH SCHOOL. HER NAME WAS KAYLEE MACDONALD. AND I MET THE FAMILY BECAUSE KAYLEE HAD BEEN AN ARDENT SUPPORTER OF MINE. SHE CAME TO MEET ME IN PITTSBURGH WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL. IT WAS HER DREAM TO SOMEDAY GO INTO POLITICS HERSELF. TRAGICALLY, KAYLEE HAD A DISEASE THAT WAS NOT PROPERLY TREATED IN THE VERY BEGINNING. AND SHE PASSED AWAY JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. AND THE SCHOOL ACTUALLY CALLED OFF SCHOOL BECAUSE SHE WAS THE KIND OF YOUNG WOMAN THAT EVERYBODY KNEW AND EVERYBODY LIKED. SHE WAS POPULAR, BUT SHE ALSO WAS KIND TO THE KIDS WHO WERE NOT. FOR TEACHERS TOLD HER PARENTS, HER GRANDPARENTS, HER LITTLE BROTHER, THAT THEY WERE SURE THAT KAYLEE WOULD HAVE REALIZED HER DREAM. I WANT TO JUST MENTION HER BECAUSE SHE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FULFILL THOSE DREAMS FOR THE KIND OF WORLD, THE KIND OF COUNTRY, SHE WANTED TO SEE. EVERY ONE OF US CAN DO OUR PART. FOR THOSE OF US IN EDUCATION, IT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE, AND I WANT TO BE A GOOD PARTNER. AND I WANT TO GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE THE CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO GO TO COLLEGE WITHOUT DROWNING IN DEBT. EVERY SINGLE YOUNG PERSON.   I KNOW WE CAN DO THIS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IT IS JUST NOT FAIR. TO MANY KIDS ARE BEING SHUT OUT. THEY START, BUT THEY NEVER FINISH. THEY NEVER GRADUATE. NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ABLE. THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT. IF THEY GET OUT, THEY OFTEN END UP WITH HUGE DEBT. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE STUDENT DEBT? YEAH. EXACTLY. WELL, I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT FROM UNDER IT. HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO DO. IN ADDITION TO HAVING DEBT FREE TUITION FOR PEOPLE GOING TO COLLEGE, IF YOU COME OUT WITH DEBT, I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO REFINANCE THAT DEBT TO SAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, TO GET IT DOWN, THE WAY YOU CAN REFINANCE A MORTGAGE OR A CAR PAYMENT. [CHEERS  AND WE ARE GOING TO REVAMP THE ENTIRE STUDENT AID INDUSTRY BECAUSE I WANT MORE PEOPLE TO HAVE THE CHANCE I DID. WHEN I GOT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL AND WENT TO WORK FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND, I MADE VERY LITTLE MONEY. I DID NOT CARE. I WANTED TO DO THAT WORK. BUT I WAS FORTUNATE BECAUSE I WAS IN A PLAN WHERE I COULD PAY BACK MY DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF MY INCOME. EVEN THOUGH I WAS ONLY MAKING $14,000 A YEAR, I COULD AFFORD TO RENT A PLACE. I WANT YOU TO HAVE THAT CHANCE. THEN I WANT TO END YOUR DEBT AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS. MAYBE 20 YEARS, YOU ARE DONE, EVEN IF YOU HAVE UNPAID DEBT AHEAD OF YOU.   AND WE ARE GOING TO GET THE HARASSING BILL COLLECTORS OUT OF YOUR LIFE. WE ARE GOING TO END THE PRACTICE OF THE GOVERNMENT MAKING MONEY OFF OF KIDS WHO GO TO SCHOOL. WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND MAKE SURE WE GET THE COST DOWN AND EXPAND THE OPPORTUNITIES UNDER IT AND TAKE ON HIGH PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. [CHEERS AND  NOW, AGAIN, EVERYTHING I JUST SAID, REPUBLICANS DO NOT AGREE WITH. THEY ALSO WANT TO LIMIT OUR RIGHTS, ALL OF OUR RIGHTS. I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHERE I STAND. I WILL DEFEND A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN HEALTH CARE DECISIONS.   AND I WILL DEFEND PLANNED PARENTHOOD AGAINST THE PARTISAN ATTACKS THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN THROWING AT THEM. [CHEERS  AND I WILL DEFEND MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND END DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY. I WILL DEFEND VOTING RIGHTS, WHICH ARE UNDER ATTACK BY STATES ACROSS OUR UNION.   AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO EITHER REVERSE OR PASS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO ABSOLUTELY END CITIZENS UNITED AND ITS CORRUPTION ON OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM.   YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THEY ARE AGAINST IT. I TAKE THIS PERSONALLY. IT WAS ABOUT ME. IT WAS ONE OF THE MANY, MANY, MANY ATTACKS THE RIGHT WING HAS WAGED AGAINST ME BY THIS GROUP, CITIZENS UNITED. AND THEY WERE, YOU KNOW, ONCE AGAIN, MAKING STUFF UP ABOUT ME, RUNNING  PRETENDED DOCUMENTARIES ABOUT ME. THEY COULD NOT DO IT. THEY APPEALED TO THE SUPREME COURT. THE SUPREME COURT SAID, OH YES OF COURSE, SPEECH EQUALS MONEY. THE MORE MONEY YOU HAVE THE MORE SPEECH YOU HAVE. SOMEHOW, I DON'T THINK THAT WAS PART OF THE LOGIC OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. I THINK THIS IS TRULY ONE OF THE WORST DECISIONS AT HER. IN OUR HISTORY. -- EVER. IN OUR HISTORY.  WE ARE ALSO GOING TO WORK HARD ON A RANGE OF ISSUES THE REPUBLICANS ARE ALSO AGAINST. I DO NOT BELIEVE WE SHOULD PRIVATIZE SOCIAL SECURITY. WE OUGHT TO EXTEND THE LIFE OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND. WE SHOULD FIX THE PROBLEMS WITH THE VETERANS MINISTRATION, NOT PRIVATIZE IT. -- VETERANS ADMINISTRATION, NOT PRIVATIZE IT.  WE SHOULD KEEP WORKING WITH COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM, WITH THE PATH TOWARDS CITIZENSHIP.  AND WE SHOW TO STAND UP TO THE GUN LOBBY TO GET COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY REFORM.  -- AND WE SHOULD STAND UP TO THE GUN LOBBY TO GET COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY REFORM. SO WE HAVE A BIG AGENDA. IT IS IMPORTANT WHEN WE IMAGINE THAT FUTURE THAT WE WANT FOR YOU TO THINK, OK WHO CAN DELIVER? YOU KNOW, BEFORE THERE WAS SOMETHING CALLED OBAMACARE WAS SOME A CALLED HILLARYCARE, RIGHT?  I HAVE BEEN IN THE TRENCHES FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE, FAIRNESS, EQUALITY MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE. I AM PROUD TO CONTINUE THAT FIGHT. BECAUSE IT IS AT THE CORE OF WHO WE ARE AS AMERICA. SO WE DO STAND UP AND MAKE SURE OUR VOICES AND OUR VOTES COUNT. AND THE SECOND TEST IS, CAN YOU KEEP US SAFE? AND HERE, YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE YOU ARE VOTING FOR A PRESIDENT AND A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. NATIONAL SECURITY --  NATIONAL SECURITY IS NOT AN AFTERTHOUGHT. IT IS A CORE POSSIBILITY OF THE PRESIDENCY.  AND IT IS ESSENTIAL.  THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO LEAD THE WORLD, TO BRING US TOGETHER, TO FURTHER OUR INTEREST THEM ADVANCE OUR VALUES, AND KEEP US SAFE AT HOME. I WAS PART OF THE BIGGEST COUNTERTERRORISM DECISION IN THE LAST DECADE, THE DECISION TO GO AFTER OSAMA BIN LADEN.  AND AS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK, I WANTED TO BRING HIM TO JUSTICE.  AND SO, I ADVISED THE PRESIDENT. TO GO FORWARD, BUT THE PRESIDENT HAD TO MAKE THE DECISION. AND PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE THE RIGHT DECISION.  NOW FINALLY, THE THIRD TEST IS, CAN YOU BRING US TOGETHER. ? AND BOY, DO WE NEED THAT RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW, WHEN I LISTEN TO THE RHETORIC COMING OUT OF DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN --  IT IS DEEPLY DISTURBING BECAUSE IT IS INTENDED TO SET PEOPLE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. IT IS INTENDED TO INCITE PREJUDICES AND PARANOIA. IT IS EVEN INTENDED TO INCITE VIOLENCE, AS WE HAVE SEEN. IT IS SO CONTRARY TO WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MUST BE IF WE ARE GOING TO OWN THE FUTURE, AND I INTEND FOR OUR COUNTRY TO OWN THE FUTURE, TO MAKE THE FUTURE, TO BE THE FUTURE.  SO LET ME TELL YOU, I WILL GO ANYWHERE ANY TIME, MEET WITH ANYONE TO FIND COMMON GROUND. I DID IT AS FIRST LADY. I DID IT AS SENATOR, SECRETARY OF STATE. AFTER WE WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL ON HEALTH CARE REFORM, I GOT BACK UP AND SAID, WHAT CAN WE DO? YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE TO DETERMINE WHAT CAN WE DO. THAT IS THE PROGRESSIVE TRADITION. SO I WORKED WITH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND WE CREATED THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM. AND 8 MILLION CHILDREN GOT HEALTH CARE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY OF HIS.  AND WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE, I WORKED WITH I THINK PRACTICALLY EVERY REPUBLICAN. I WORKED TO FIND THAT COMMON GROUND, SOMETIMES IT WAS ONLY A SLIVER OF GROUND. BUT THAT IS OUR OBLIGATION WHEN WE ARE IN PUBLIC LIFE. WE DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY, AS SOME DO DICTATORSHIPS AND RELIGIOUS THEOCRACIES TO SAY MY WAY OR NO WAY, THAT IS NOT THE WAY DEMOCRACY IS SUPPOSED TO WORK. WE'VE MADE PROGRESS SOMETIMES WAY TOO SLOWLY TO SATISFY ME. AND WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF HELPED TO NEGOTIATE A NUCLEAR ARMS TREATY WITH RUSSIA TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON BOTH SIDES. WHAT REMAINS THE BIGGEST THREAT, THE BIGGEST IMMEDIATE THREAT THAT OUR WORLD FACES. AND WE GOT THE AGREEMENT SIGNED. BUT WE HAD TO GET TWO THIRDS VOTE IN THE SENATE, THAT MEANT I NEEDED 30 REPUBLICANS TO VOTE. I STARTED WORKING ON A, WORKING AND WORKING AND WORKING. IT IS KIND OF A DI ULL, BORING, BUT NECESSARY KIND OF WORK. HOW CAN I PUSH THIS FORWARD JUST AN INCH OR 2, 6 OR SEVEN IF I AM LUCKY? WELL, I GOT THOSE THOSE. WE GOT THOSE TREATIES. BECAUSE WE LOWERED THE NUMBER OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES. SO HERE IS WHAT I AM ASKING YOU. I AM ASKING YOU TO IMAGINE THE FUTURE WITH ME. BECAUSE I WANT YOUR SUPPORT OF COURSE. IN THIS UPCOMING PRIMARY ON APRIL 26, BUT I WILL ALSO WANT IT IF I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE THE NOMINEE IN NOVEMBER. WHAT TO YOU WHEN I REALLY WANT IT --  I REALLY WANT IT WHEN I AM SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT. AND WE ALL BEGIN TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS, TO MAKE THE FUTURE HAPPEN.   SO CARNEGIE MELLON, PITTSBURGH, WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA, PLEASE COME SUPPORT ME ON APRIL 26 AND I WILL FIGHT FOR AND SUPPORT YOU FOR THE NEXT 4-8 YEARS. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.   THIS IS MY FIGHT SONG TAKE BACK MY LIFE SONG I WILL BE STRONG I WILL PLAY MY FIGHT SONG ","Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"
37,2016-04-04,http://www.c-span.org/video/?407671-1/hillary-clinton-campaign-event-cohoes-new-york,"[u'paul tonko', u'kirsten e. gillibrand', u'hillary clinton', u'end']",Clinton,"  THANK YOU SO MUCH. OH MY GOSH, IT IS SO GREAT TO BE IN NEW YORK AND TO BE UP HERE IN THE CAPITAL REGION. I AM SO PROUD TO BE STANDING ON THIS STAGE WITH TWO FRIENDS AND FORMER COLLEAGUES. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THEIR SERVICE, THEIR LEADERSHIP AND THEIR SUPPORT. I WAS LISTENING TO PAUL AS HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE WORK WE DID TOGETHER. IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE CASE THAT HE HAS TACKLED SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGES FACING OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY. NOW HE IS TAKING ON ANOTHER DIFFICULT CHALLENGE. HE IS FOCUSED ON FIXING THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR WATER SYSTEM HERE IN NEW YORK AND ACROSS AMERICA. HE'S TRYING TO GET SUPPORT FROM THE CONGRESS AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN IF I'M FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT TO MAKE SURE YOU DO, PAUL. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE HERE IN AMERICA AND AROUND THE WORLD, ALTHOUGH IT MAY NOT BE IN THE HEADLINES, WATER IS ONE OF THEM. THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT TO PROTECT OUR RESOURCES. I WAS PROUD TO WORK WITH SO MANY TO CLEAN UP THE HUDSON. WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WATER SYSTEM ACROSS THIS STATE ARE CLEAN AND PURE SO THAT WE CAN TAKE ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE IN THE WATER WE DRINK AND USE. NEW YORK IS IN SUCH A CRITICAL POSITION BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH WATER. WE HAVE TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF OUR WATER. SO PAUL, I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, IT WAS A REALLY HARD DECISION FOR ME TO LEAVE THE SENATE. I ADOR ADORED BEING YOUR SENATOR. I LOVED REPRESENTING NEW YORK. IT WAS THE GREATEST HONOR IMAGINABLE. THAT THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK TOOK A CHANCE ON ME AND THE 2000 ELECTION. LET ME SERVE YOU AND THEN REELECTED ME IN 2006. WHEN PRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA ASKED ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE, I SAID I'M SO HONORED, I'M SO FLATTERED MR. PRESIDENT ELECT, BUT I LOVE REPRESENTING NEW YORK IN THE SENATE. HE SAID, WELL, WITH ALL THE PROBLEMS WE'RE INHERITING FROM THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, HE SAID, I TRUST YOU TO BE MY SECRETARY OF STATE. I TOLD HIM NOT ONCE BUT TWICE THAT ALTHOUGH, I UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE JOB, I WANTED TO REPRESENT ALL OF YOU IN THE SENATE. HE SAID TO ME, I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU AGAIN UNTIL YOU SAY YES. I SAID TO MY HUSBAND, I SAID YOU KNOW, I'M STILL FLATTERED PRESIDENT-ELECT ASKED ME AND I TOLD HIM NO TWICE, HE KEEPS TELLING ME HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO ME UNTIL I SAY YES. BILL LOOKED AT ME AND GOES, WELL, I ASKED YOU TO MARRY ME TWICE, YOU SAID NO AND I SAID LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE READY. HE SAID SO MAYBE THERE'S A PATTERN HERE. EVENTUALLY, OF COURSE, I DID SAY YES AND IT WAS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH THE PRESIDENT TO FRANKLY TRY TO UNDO A LOT OF THE DAMAGE THAT HAS BEEN DONE THE PRIOR EIGHT YEARS. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I FELT SO MUCH BETTER ABOUT MAKING THIS DECISION WHEN KIRSTEN WAS ASKED TO SUCCEED ME AND TO FILL THIS SENATE SEAT. HE KNOWN HER SINCE 2000. THIS BRIGHT YOUNG LAWYER FROM ALBANY. I SAW HER IN ACTION. SHE SUPPORTED ME. SHE RAISED MONEY. SHE MADE SPEECHES. SHE MADE PHONE CALLS. SHE JUST DID EVERYTHING SHE COULD TO GET ME ELECTED TO THE SENATE. WHEN SHE DECIDED TO RUN FOR THE HOUSE SOME YEARS LATER, I WAS HELPING HER SPEAKING FOR HER BECAUSE I KNEW WHAT A GREAT REPRESENTATIVE SHE WOULD BE. THEN OF COURSE, SHE HAS BEEN A SUPERB SENATOR ALONG WITH CHUCK SCHUMER FOR NEW YORK. I KNOW WHAT GOOD HANDS NEW YORK IS IN. I WANT TO JUST TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU PROBABLY ALL READY ARE THINKING. THIS ELECTION IS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS, CONSEQUENTLY BELIEVES WE'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME. IT IS FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES ARE STARK. I BELIEVE THE FACTS PROVE THAT OUR ECONOMY DOES BETTER WHEN WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE.  WE SAW THAT IN THE 1990'S WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS PRESIDENT AND 23 MILLION NEW JOBS AND INCOMES WENT UP FOR EVERYBODY. THEN WHAT HAPPENED? WE REVERSED COURSE. THE REPUBLICANS CAME BACK WITH THEIR FAILED ECONOMIC POLICY OF TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS. IT DESERVES A LOT OF BOOS. WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE, I WAS ARGUING AND VOTING AGAINST THESE POLICIES. BECAUSE I BELIEVE THEN, IT WOULD REVERSE THE ECONOMIC PROGRESS WE WERE MAKING. WE HAD A LOT OF WORK STILL TO DO HERE IN UPSTATE AND OTHER PLACES. BUT, THEY GOT THEIR WAY. SLASHED TAXES ON THE WEALTHY. TAKE THEIR EYES OFF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE MORTGAGE MARKET. WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. WHEN PRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA CALLED TO ASK ME TO COME TO CHICAGO TO TALK ABOUT BECOMING SECRETARY OF STATE. BEFORE WE TALKED ABOUT THE WORLD AND OUR CHALLENGES, HE JUST LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, IT IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN THEY TOLD US. WE WERE LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH. 9 MILLION AMERICANS LOST THEIR JOBS. 5 MILLION HOMES WERE LOST AND $13 TRILLION IN FAMILY WEALTH WAS WIPED OUT. WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS? BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER IT. I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT THE REAL DIFFERENCE CHOICES ARE. WE HAVE PEOPLE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE LED BY DONALD TRUMP WHO ARE -- HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE. HE MAY BE THE MOST FLAMBOYANT. THEY ALL WANT TO TAKE US BACK TO TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS. WE CANNOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. THE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC ISSUE IN THIS CAMPAIGN WILL BE ENSURING THAT WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE COME NEXT JANUARY. HERE IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING. IT'S NOT JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP GOING ALONG AND MAKING PROGRESS. I WANT TO REALLY HAVE BROAD BASED INCLUSIVE PROSPERITY AGAIN. MORE GOOD JOBS RISING INCOME. THAT'S WHY I LAID OUT PLANS TO GET MORE INFRASTRUCTURE JOBS INCLUDING CREATION OF A NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE BANK TO FUND WHAT WE NEED TO DO WITH ROADS, BRIDGE, TUNNELS AND AIRPORTS. IT'S NOT JUST WHAT WE SEE, WE ALSO HAVE TO FIX OUR WATER SYSTEMS. OUR SEWER SYSTEM. LEAKING PIPELINES UNDER THE GROUND. WE HAVE WORK TO DO. THESE ARE GOOD JOBS. THESE ARE MOSTLY UNION JOBS WHERE PEOPLE CAN MAKE A GOOD LIVING. THEN, I WAS IN SYRACUSE A FEW DAYS AGO. ANNOUNCING MY MANUFACTURING AGENDA BECAUSE I WANT US TO MAKE IT IN AMERICA. I KNOW WE CAN DO THAT. WE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT HERE IN THE CAPITAL REGION. WITH NANOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY AND CHIP AND OTHER THINGS BEING MADE IN AMERICA RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK. I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST WORKED ON NANOTECHNOLOGY, I WAS TELLING PEOPLE IN THE SENATE, I WANTED TO GET SOME FUNDS TO REALLY BEGIN TO INVEST IN NANOTECHNOLOGY RIGHT HERE IN THE CAPITAL REGION. IT SEEM LIKE A LONG TIME AGO. BUT LOOK AT THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO ACROSS UPSTATE. ACROSS AMERICA BUT THE REASON I EMPHASIZE UPSTATE IS BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SKILLS. WE HAVE THE HEARD WORKING PEOPLE. WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. I WILL BE THE PRESIDENT WHO BRINGS MANUFACTURING BACK TO UPSTATE NEW YORK AND AMERICA. ANOTHER WAY WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A LOT OF NEW JOBS IS BY COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE. I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THIS ISSUE. I WORKED ON IT. I THOUGHT WE WERE MAKING PROGRESS WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE. THERE WERE REPUBLICANS WHO WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE A SPEECH ABOUT IT. TAKE A TRIP. I TOOK TRIPS WITH PEOPLE LIKE JOHN MCCAIN. WE WENT TO SOME OF THE NORTHERN MOST PLACES IN AMERICA. IN THE WORLD TO LOOK AT WHAT WAS HAPPENING. UP IN ALASKA, NORTHERN MOST INHABITED ISLAND IN THE WORLD. I THOUGHT WE WERE MAKING PROGRESS. ALL OF A SUDDEN, BETWEEN EXTREME PARTISANS AND THE KOCH BROTHERS, YOU CAN'T GET REPUBLICAN ANYMORE TO SAY THE WORD CLIMATE CHANGE. WHEN THEY'RE ASKED, THOSE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, THEY ALL SAY THE SAME THING. I DON'T KNOW, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST. I KEEP SAYING, WELL GO TALK TO A SCIENTIST AND LISTEN TO A SCIENTIST. I BET THEY CAN TALK TO A TEACHER RIGHT HERE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AND GET A GOOD LESSON ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE AFRAID TO EVEN FACE IT. BACK IN 2009, WHEN I BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE, I IMMEDIATELY BEGAN WORKING WITH THE PRESIDENT. TO TRY TO LAY THE GROUND WORK. WE HAD TO GET FAST GROWING COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND INDIA AND OTHERS TO SIGN ON EVEN FACE TO CUTTING THEIR EMISSIONS. IT TOOK YEARS BUT WE FINALLY GOT IT DONE. I WAS REALLY PROUD THAT THANKS TO AMERICAN LEADERSHIP, WE GOT THAT AGREEMENT SIGNED IN PARIS. THAT COMMITS THE REST OF THE WORLD TO TAKING STEPS TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. NOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT NOT ONLY HOW WE CONTINUE TO LEAD BUT HOW WE CAN BE THE LEADER. SOME NATION IS GOING TO BE THE 21st CENTURY CLEAN ENERGY SUPER POWER. RIGHT NOW IF I WERE GUESSING, YOU'D SAY IT'S GERMANY, CHINA OR US. I WANT IT TO BE US. I INTEND FOR IT TO BE. BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE'S HEALTH, TO PROTECT OUR PLANET BUT IT'S ALSO SMART. THERE WILL BE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS AND BUSINESSES COMING OUT OF THE EFFORTS TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE. I SET TWO BIG GOALS. I WANT US TO DEPLOY A HALF BILLION MORE SOLAR PANELS BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM. AND ENOUGH CLEAN ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME IN AMERICA BY THE END OF MY SECOND TERM. YOU KNOW, MY FRIENDS, IT IS EASY TO TELL SOMEBODY WHAT YOU'RE AGAINST. I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT I'M FOR. I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT MY PLANS ARE. WHAT I THINK DOAK -- WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER. WE DO MORE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. WOULD CREATE ABOUT 75% OF THE NEW JOBS. I WANT TO HAVE A MUCH MORE SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR THAT. I ESPECIALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT TO START JOBS, NEW BUSINESSES AND JOB CREATION AND ENTREPRENEURIALISM. I HAVE TO SAY, I WAS VERY PROUD TO STAND WITH GOVERNOR CUOMO TODAY IN NEW YORK CITY AS HE SIGNED THE INCREASE OF MINIMUM WAGE. WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT. FIRST AND FOREMOST TO LIFT PEOPLE WHO WORK FULL TIME OUT OF POVERTY. HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, WE ARE A 70% CONSUMPTION ECONOMY. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? PEOPLE DON'T HAVE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS TO SPEND, WE DON'T GROW. SO THE MORE MONEY WE GET BACK INTO THE MOST POCKET, INSTEAD OF THE MOST MONEY GOING TO THE FEWEST POCKET OF PEOPLE AT THE TOP, THE FASTER OUR ECONOMY WILL GROW AND MORE JOBS WITH RISING INCOMES WILL BE GOOD FOR EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO QUICKLY RAISE INCOMES? IS TO FINALLY GUARANTEE EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN'S WORK. AGAIN, TO ME THIS IS ABOUT GROWTH AND FAIRNESS. IS A WOMAN'S ISSUE? OF COURSE IT IS. BUT IT'S ALSOAL FAMILY ISSUE -- BUT IT'S ALSO A FAMILY ISSUE. ANY FAMILY WHO HAS A WOMAN WORKING WHO IS NOT BEING PAID FAIRLY IS PENALIZED. WHEN YOU GO TO THE STORE AND YOU CHECK OUT WITH WHAT YOU'RE BUYING, THEY DON'T SAY OKAY, YOU ONLY MAKE 78 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS. WE'VE GOT TO THINK. WIE NED TO GROW THE ECONOMY AND WE NEED TO BE SURE THE ECONOMY IS FAIR. ONE OF THE WAYS WE HAVE TO DO THAT TOO IS TO PENALIZE THOSE COMPANIES THAT WANT TO SHIP JOBS OVERSEAS. THERE IS LESS AND LESS REASON FOR THEM TO DO THAT. HERE'S WHAT I'M PROPOSING. IF ANY COMPANY EVER GOT ONE PENNY OF TAXPAYER HELP FROM A LOCAL COUNTY, STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THEN THEY HAVE TO PAY IT ALL BACK. BECAUSE THEY GOT THAT HELP TO KEEP JOBS RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK AND AMERICA. IF ANY COMPANY WANTS TO MOVE ABROAD AND SOME OF THEM DO WHAT'S CALLED AN INVERSION, WHICH I CALL A PERVERSION. THEY MOVE THEIR HEADQUARTERS, THEY PRETEND TO MOVE SO THEY CAN AVOID PAYING TAXES. ANYBODY WHO DOES THAT, WE'RE GOING TO SLAP THE BIGGEST EXIT TAX ON THEM TO MAKE THEM THINK TWICE ABOUT LEAVING OUR COUNTRY. WE GOING TO ENFORCE TRADE AGREEMENTS LIKE I DID WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE. I PUSHED HARD TO ENFORCE TRADE AGREEMENT. I VOTED AGAINST THE MULTINATIONAL ONE THAT CAME BEFORE US. I SAID I'M AGAINST THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT WILL RAISE INCOMES AND PRODUCE JOBS FOR NEW YORKERS AND AMERICANS. EVERYTHING JUST ABOUT I'VE SAID, THE REPUBLICANS DISAGREE WITH. THAT'S GOING TO BE A REAL CHOICE. WE CAN GO BACK TO THE OLD WAYS, THE OLD SNAKE OIL. OR WE CAN DO WHAT WORKS. I THINK EGOT A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT THAT IS. IT'S ALSO TRUE FOR EDUCATION. WE NEED TO START WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. UNIVERSAL PREKINDERGARTEN, THEN IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND SECONDARY SCHOOL, I WANT TO BE A GOOD PARTNER TO OUR TEACHERS. I WANT TO SUPPORT OUR TEACHERS. I AM TIRED OF ALL OF THE SCAPEGOATING OF OUR EDUCATORS. WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING IS HELPING TO SUPPORT OUR TEACHERS AND OUR EDUCATORS TO GET THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO DO THE JOB WE ASK THEM TO DO. I ALSO HAVE PLAN TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AGAIN. I SHARE THAT GOAL WITH SENATOR SANDERS. WE HAVE A DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING IT. I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. I SAID, LOOK, WE NEED TO HAVE DEBT FREE TUITION. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BORROW A PENNY. IF YOU'RE WE'LL, YOU HAVE TO PAY. I BELIEVE THAT IS A GREAT BARRIER AND MORE AFFORDABLE WAY TO GET TO GET TO AFFORDABLE COLLEGE. WHAT I HAVE SAID IS, I'M GOING TO WORK TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS IT, GETS TO GO TO A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY WITHOUT BORROWING A PENNY. I WANT TO WORK TO GET THE COST DOWN. I AM ASKED UNITS TO WORK TEN HOURS A WEEK. IF THEY DO WORK AT THE COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY, THAT WOULD HELP LOWER THE COST. WE CAN GET THE COST DOWN FOR MORE PEOPLE AND THAT WILL HELP US SEND MORE TO COLLEGE. >> I PAY FOR IT BY TAXING THE WE'LL. I CAN FORD TO DO THAT. SENATOR SANDERS HAS THE SAME GOAL. HE ADVOCATES FREE COLLEGE. THAT MEANS FREE FOR EVERYBODY INCLUDING DONALD TRUMP'S KIDS. I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO DO THAT. I THINK WE NEED TOE FOCUS ON WHERE THE PROBLEM IS. MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES, WORK FAMILIES AND POOR FAMILIES. SENATOR SANDERS PLAN DEPENDS UPON GOVERNORS SHIPPING IN ABOUT QUARTER THE COST. THINK ABOUT THAT. ABOUT 30 OF OUR GOVERNORS ARE REPUBLICANS. THEY ARE WORKING AS HARD AS THEY CAN TO TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM HIGHER EDUCATION. I SPENT TIME THIS LAST WEEK IN WISCONSIN, WHERE THEIR GOVERNMENT SCOTT WALKER, CUT $250 MILLION FROM HIGHER EDUCATION. HE WOULD BE EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE $300 MILLION. I AM NOT THE ALL COUNTING ON SCOTT WALKER HAVING A CHANGE OF HEART. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A PROMISE I CAN'T PEEP. I CAN MAKE AND KEEP THE PROMISE OF DEBT FREE TUITION SO THAT MORE OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GET TO COLLEGE. THEN, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO PAY DOWN AND END YOUR STUDENT DEBT. HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE CURRENTLY HAVE STUDENT DEBT? WE HAVE AN INTEREST RATE HIGHER THAN 8%. ANYBODY HIGHER THAN 10%? FEEL LIKE I'M IN AN AUCTION. I WANT EVERYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE TO HEAR THIS. WE HAVE NEW ENGLAND PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING SIX, EIGHT, 12% INTEREST. NOTHING HAS THAT KIND OF INTEREST. CREDIT CARD DEBT. YOU CAN FINANCE YOUR REFINES OUR MORTGAGE AND REFINANCE YOUR CAR. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. WE WILL SAVE -- THEN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE PEOPLE INTO PROGRAMS LIKE I HAVE. WHEN I GOT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL, I DID WORK WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. I WAS MAKING $14 A YEAR. BASE. BUT GOT IT PAID OFF. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE PAY BACK AS A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME. THEN WE'RE GOING TO END YOUR OBLIGATION AFTER 20 YEARS YOU'RE DONE. I'M NOT GOING TO KEEP THIS GOING. WE ARE GOING TO STOP OUR GOVERNMENT FROM MAKING A PROFIT ON ON LANDING MONEY TO YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET AN EDUCATION. THE OTHER PART OF WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN PRODUCE RESULTS FOR PEOPLE, IS WHETHER WE GET EVERYBODY ACCESS TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. SOMETHING I CARE DEEPLY WILL. BEFORE THERE WAS SOMETHING CALLED OBAMACARE, THERE WAS SOMETHING CALLED HILLARYCARE. WE HAD QUITE THE BALLLY WITH THE DRUG COMPANIES AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. THEY REALLY WON THAT TIME. BUT THEN I GOT BACK UP AND I SAID OKAY, WHAT CAN I GET DONE. THAT'S WHEN I. HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES HEALTH INSURANCE TO KIDS. THAT'S WHY I WAS SO THRILLED WHEN PROHM -- WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO THIS SINCE HARRY TRUMAN. NOW WE'VE GOT IT DONE AND 90% OF AMERICANS ARE COVER. I WANT TO GET THE COSTS DOWN. I WANT TO GET THE CHOICES UP. I WANT TO GO RIGHT AFTER THE DRUG COMPANYIES TO REIN IN. WE'RE GOING TO START BY BY REQUIRING THOME -- THAT WILL RIPPLE THROUGH THE ENTIRE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THESE ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND SETTING FORTH IDEAS AND PLANS ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS IT. I THINK THE FIRST TEST THAT YOU SHOULD HOLD ANYBODY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THEY MEET. CAN THEY ACTUALLY MAKE YOUR LIFE BETTER. CAN YOU -- I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT I WANT TO DO. I ALSO WANT YOU TO KNOW WHERE I STAND ON RIGHTS. BECAUSE THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO STRIP AWAY, UNDER MINE, ERODE, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR RIGHTS. CIVIL RIGHTS, GAY RIGHTS AND RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. >> I WILL STAND TO MAKE A OF -- I WILL DEPEND PLANNED PARENTHOOD FROM THESE PARTISAN POLITICAL ATTACKS. I WILL DEFEND MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND WORK TO END DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY. I WILL DEFEND VOTING RIGHT AND WORK TO END CITIZENS UNITED AND ITS-- I WILL DEFEND THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION, MAKE IT BETTER BUT PREVENT THE REPUBLICANS FROM TEARING IT APART. I WILL KEEP WORKING FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP. I HAD WORK TO GIVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO PEOPLE WHO DISABILITIES WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND HOUSING. I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY REFORMS. THAT WILL SAVE LIVES IN IN OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE A BIG AGENDA HERE AT HOME. BUT THE SECOND TEST, SHOULD HOLD ANY CANDIDATE TOO. CANDACECAN -- CAN THIS PERSON LEAD US. LY DO MY BEST TO MAKE SURE ALL THE EXPERIENCE THAT I'VE HAD STARTING AS YOUR SENATOR, AFTER 9/11 AND GOING ALL THE WAY THROUGH MY SECRETARY OF STATE YEARS, IT'S PUT TO GOOD USE TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE. SIGN MAKE SURE WE WORK WITH OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES. AS SOME OF YOU REMEMBER, AFTER 9/11, WE WERE NOT SURE WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. WE KNEW WE HAD TO BE PREPARED. I GIVE GREAT CREDIT TO THE NYPD AND TO EVERYBODY WORKING TO KEEP US SAFE. WE LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS. WE LEARNED THAT EVERYBODY HAD TO BE PART OF OUR DEFENSE. IF THEY SAW SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS, THEY SHOULD REPORT IT. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DID. IT PROVED TO BE A REALLY SMART STRATEGY. WHEN I HEAR DONALD TRUMP OR TED CRUZ WITH THOSE OFFENSIVE COMMENTS THEY MAKE ABOUT MUSLIMS, IT'S NOT ONLY WRONG. IT'S DANGEROUS. WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO IS MAKE SURE EVERYBODY FEELS COMFORTABLE AND WELLED TO PICK UP THAT PHONE OR TO GO ON TO THEIR COMPUTER TO REPORT SOMETHING. PEOPLE ON FRONT LINE WILL HEAR MORE AND SEE MORE. VERY OFTEN IN OUR AMERICAN MUSLIM COMMUNITIES. WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE COALITION WITH MANY NATIONS IN ORDER TO DEFEAT ISIS. MAGAZINESOMETHING THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCE IN DOING BECAUSE I PUT TOGETHER A COALITION THAT BROUGHT IRAN TO NEGOTIATING TABLE AND IMPOSING STRICTER SANCTIONS. WHEN DONALD TRUMP TALKED ABOUT PULLING OUT OF NATO OR KEEPING MUSLIMS OUT OF THE UNITED STATES OR EVEN ABANDONING OUR ALLEYS IN THE PACIFIC. THAT DOES NOT MAKE HIM SOUND STRONG. IT MAKES HIM SOUND LIKE HE'S IN OVER HIS HEAD. FINALLY, THE THIRD TEST. CAN YOU UNIFY OUR COUNTRY? WE HAVE TOO MUCH DEVICIVENESS. THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED. EVEN FEARFUL. SOMETIMES ANGRY ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY. I UNDERSTAND THAT. ESPECIALLY WHAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE GREAT RECESSION. SOME OF THEM HAVEN'T RECOVERED YET AT ALL. I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN. BUT TO PLAY TO THAT IN A WAY THAT BRINGS OUT ANGER AND PREJUDICE AND PARANOIA, DOESN'T HELP US SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS. IT'S OKAY TO GET ANGRY. WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'LL DO ABOUT IT. WHAT'S OUR PLAN? WHAT'S OUR STRATEGY? WE ARE AT OUR BEST. SO MUCH OF AMERICAN HISTORY CAME OUT OF NEW YORK. WE ARE AT OUR BEST. REMEMBER WHAT OUR GREAT FORMER GOVERNOR AND PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT SAID. ALL WE HAVE TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF. I WILL GO ANYWHERE ANY TIME TO MEET WITH ANY ONE TO FIND COMMON GROUND. YOU WORK WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH MAYBE 90% OF THE ISSUES UP. TRY TO FIND THAT TEN PERCENT. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO AS YOUR PRESIDENT. I WILL GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY AND WORK FOR THE RESULT THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR LIVES TO KEEP US SAFE AND TO UNIFY OUR COUNTRY. I WANT TO END ON WHAT KIRSTEN SAID ABOUT PEOPLE WHO INSPIRED HER AND MENTORED HER. I'M HONORED TO BE LISTED WITH HER GRANDMOTHER AND MOTHER. SHE MENTIONED MY MOTHER. YOU KNOW, I OFTEN WONDER AT HOW MY MOTHER CAME OUT OF WHAT WAS A VERY NEGLECTFUL AND TERRIBLE CHILDHOOD. LITERALLY BEING SENT AWAY NOT WANTED BY HER PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WHO DIDN'T WANT HER EITHER. ENDING UP WORKING AS A HOUSE MAID AT THE AGE OF 14. LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE BEING SENT AWAY NOT MEANINGFUL TO HER. SHE WAS FORTUNATE BECAUSE A WOMAN WHO'S HOME SHE WORKED IN, REALIZED MY MOTHER WANTED TO GO TO HIGH SCHOOL. SHE WOULD GET UP EARLY IN MORNING AND DO THE CHORES AND RUN TO HIGH SCHOOL, GO TO HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN RUN BACK AND FINISH THE CHORES. SHE DID THAT FOR FOUR YEARS. I CONSIDERED HER ONE TIME WHEN -- I ASKED HER ONE TIME. HOW DID YOU SURVIVE THIS. SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, AT CRITICAL MOMENTS IN MY LIFE, SOMEBODY SHOWED ME KINDNESS. KIND WORD, A KIND GESTURE. IT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE TO HER. IN THIS CAMPAIGN, I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW WE NEED MORE LOVE AND KINDNESS TOWARD EACH OTHER IN OUR COUNTRY. HOW WE HAVE TO TRY AGAIN TO SEE THE WORLD THROUGH OTHER'S EYES THEN FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE IT BETTER. THEN FINALLY, I'M INSPIRED EVERYDAY BY MY GRANDDAUGHTER. HAVING AN 18-MONTH-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER WITH ANOTHER ON THE WAY THIS SUMMER IS JUST -- IT'S PERSONALLY THE MOST WONDERFUL THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED. IT IS LIKE FALLING IN LOVE ALL OVER AGAIN. HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW. OF COURSE, BILL AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR GRANDDAUGHTER HAS EVERY OPPORTUNITY IN LIFE. BUT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. IT REALLY MATTERS WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY SHE AND ALL OF OUR OTHER KIDS WILL BECOME ADULTS IN. IS A COUNTRY THAT IS STILL BELIEVING IN AND REALIZING THE PROMISE OF AMERICA FOR EVERYONE OR JUST A FEW? IT REALLY MATTERS WHAT KIND OF WORLD IS OUT THERE WAITING FOR HER AND EVERY OTHER CHILD IN OUR COUNTRY. IS A SAFE WORLD? IS A PROSPEROUS AND PEACEFUL WORLD? IS A WORLD WE'RE ABLE TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND ALL THE OTHER CHANGES WE FACE. HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW. I DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH THAT MY GRANDDAUGHTER HAS OPPORTUNITIES IN LIFE. I WANT YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN TO HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES. TO LIVE UP TO THEIR DREAM. TO FULFILL THEIR OWN POTENTIAL. THAT WILL BE THE MISSION OF MY PRESIDENCY. I NEED YOUR HELP ON APRIL 19th. PLEASE COME OUT AND LET'S VOTE FOR A FUTURE THAT WE WILL MAKE TOGETHER. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.       >>","Hillary Clinton Campaign Event in Cohoes, New York"
38,2016-04-02,http://www.c-span.org/video/?407537-2/wisconsin-democratic-party-founders-day-gala-hillary-clinton-remarks,"[u'announcer', u'hillary clinton']",Clinton,"  THANK YOU. HELLO, MILWAUKEE.  THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK MARCO LANNING AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF WISCONSIN. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH SOME OF YOUR BEST. THE WALKIES MAYOR, TOM BARRETT. YOUR FEARLESS CONGRESSWOMAN, GLENMORE. YOUR FANTASTIC SENATOR TAMMY BALDWIN. AND WHAT A GREAT DAY WHEN WE CAN ONCE AGAIN TALK ABOUT YOUR TGWO -- YOUR TWO FANTASTIC SENATORS WITH RUSS FEINGOLD. I WANT TO THANK MY FRIEND, CECILE RICHARDS, FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. THERE IS A LOT ABOUT THE FIELD THAT I ADMIRE, INCLUDING THE LOVE POISE HE SHOWED WHEN SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER WITH SOME OF THE MOST BACKS -- BACKED AND ADVERSE REPUBLICANS. TRUST ME, THAT IS NOT EASY. AND I AM SO GRATEFUL TO HAVE BEEN AN DOOR STOOD BY THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD ACTION FUND.  I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY FRIEND, YOUR NEIGHBOR, SENATOR AL FRANKEN, FOR CAMPAIGNING HERE FOR ME. AND I'M TOLD THAT CONGRESSMAN ANDRE CARSON FROM INDIANA'S HERE , AND CONGRESSWOMAN MAXINE WATERS FROM CALIFORNIA. TO ALL OF THE CITY, STATE AND LOCAL LEADERS, WHO POUR YOUR HEARTS INTO BUILDING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ACROSS WISCONSIN, PLEASE KNOW THIS. I WILL HELP YOU TAKE BACK THE GOVERNORSHIP AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE. YOU SEE, I AM A PROUD DEMOCRAT AND I SUPPORT DEMOCRATS UP AND DOWN THE TICKET. ALWAYS HAVE AND ALWAYS WILL. AND TO THE UNION MEMBERS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF ORGANIZED LABOR WHO HAVE FACED A HOSTILE AGENDA IN THIS STATE, PLEASE KNOW HELP IS ON THE WAY. WE ARE HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE WE WANT, TOGETHER, TO BUILD A FUTURE WHERE EVERY AMERICAN CAN LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL, NO WAY -- NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM, WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE, OR DO YOU LOVE. WE BELIEVE NO ONE WHO WORKS FULL TIME SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE IN POVERTY IN AMERICA AND THAT EVERY AMERICAN DESERVES THE PEACE OF MIND THAT COMES WITH QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. WE BELIEVE THAT, WHEN A GOVERNOR ATTACKS TEACHERS, NURSES, AND FIREFIGHTERS, IT DOESN'T MAKE HIM A LEADER. IT MAKES HIM A FULLY -- A BULLY.  WE BELIEVE AMERICA'S DIVERSITY IS A STRENGTH, NOT A WEAKNESS. AND THIS ALL MAKES US, JOINED TOGETHER AS DEMOCRATS. AND I'M PROUD OF THE CAMPAIGN THAT SENATOR SANDERS HAVE BEEN RUNNING. IT HAS BEEN HARD-FOUGHT ALL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. AND HERE IN WISCONSIN, IT IS NO EXCEPTION. BUT WE HAVE TRIED TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE ISSUES, AS COMPARED TO THE REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON ELSE -- ON INSULTS.  AND I AM DEEPLY HONORED TO HAVE RECEIVED NEARLY 9 MILLION VOTES SO FAR. AND NOW TELL YOU, THAT IS A MILLION MORE THAN DONALD TRUMP HAS RECEIVED. IT IS ALSO TWO POINT 5 MILLION MORE THAN SENATOR SANDERS, BUT I AM NOT TAKING ANYTHING OR ANYONE FOR GRANTED. I HOPE TO EARN YOUR SUPPORT THIS TUESDAY. AND HERE IS WHAT I BELIEVE ABOUT THIS RATE -- THIS RACE. ANYONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT FACES THREE BIG TESTS. FIRST, CAN YOU DELIVER RESULTS THAT IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES? SECOND, CAN YOU KEEP A SAFE? THIRD, CAN YOU BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER? I THINK EVERY CANDIDATE SHOULD BE JUDGED I THOSE TESTS. SO LET'S TALK A MINUTE FOR -- ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE FOR PEOPLE AND FAMILIES. I KNOW RIGHT NOW A LOT OF AMERICANS ARE FRUSTRATED. THEY ARE WORRIED THAT THEIR BEST DAYS AND OUR COUNTRY'S BEST DAYS ARE BEHIND US. AND I UNDERSTAND WHY. 9 MILLION AMERICANS LOST THEIR JOBS IN THE GREAT RECESSION. 5 MILLION HOMES WERE LOST. $13 TRILLION IN FAMILY WEALTH WAS WIPED OUT. AND A LOT OF AMERICANS HAVEN'T RECOVERED FROM THAT. WORKING PEOPLE ON AVERAGE HAVEN'T HAD A RAISE IN 15 YEARS. AND THEY WONDER, BECAUSE THEY TELL ME THEY DO, HOW THEY ARE EVER GOING TO GIVE THEIR KIDS THE OPPORTUNITIES THEY DESERVE. THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO BREAK DOWN ALL THE BARRIERS HOLDING PEOPLE BACK. WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER TO BUILD LADDERS OF OPPORTUNITY IN THEIR PLACE. WE HAVE TO MAKE THE PROMISE OF AMERICA REAL FOR ALL OF OUR PEOPLE. AND THAT STARTS WITH CREATING MORE GOOD JOBS WITH RISING INCOME THAT PROVIDE DIGNITY AND PRIDE. THE GOOD JOBS OF THE FUTURE ARE GOING TO END UP SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD. I WANT THEM TO BE HERE COMING WISCONSIN, AND ACROSS AMERICA.  AND EVERY CANDIDATE OWES IT TO YOU TO COME UP WITH A REAL IDEAS FOR HOW TO DO THAT. THAT'S WHY I HAVE LAID OUT A NATIONAL MANUFACTURING STRATEGY, SO WE CAN MAKE IT IN AMERICA. AND JUST THIS WEEK, I'VE PROPOSED A NEW $10 BILLION INVESTMENT TO BRING TOGETHER WORKERS AND UNIONS, BUSINESSES AND UNIVERSITIES, AND GOVERNMENT AT EVERY LEVEL TO CREATE THOSE NEW JOBS. AND I WANT EVERYBODY TO COME UP WITH THEIR OWN MANUFACTURING PLAN. BECAUSE, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THIS ELECTION SHOULD BE HELD, CARRIED OUT, FOUGHT OVER AGENDAS. WHAT IS IT YOU SAY YOU ARE GOING TO DO? AND HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO GET IT DONE? I HAVE ALSO OFFERED SPECIFIC REFORMS TO FORCE COMPANIES THAT SHIP JOBS OVERSEAS TO GIVE BACK EVERY PENNY IN TAX BREAKS AND THEY EVER GOT RIGHT HERE AT HOME.  AND IF THEY TRY TO MOVE THEIR HEADQUARTERS TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY TO CUT THEIR TAX BILLS, THEY WILL GET A TAX TO HELP THE COMMUNITIES THEY WANT TO LEAVE BEHIND.  I'VE ALSO LAID OUT APPROACHES THAT WILL MAKE IT HARDER FOR WALL STREET TO FORCE BUSINESSES TO TREAT WORKERS AT COST OF THE CUT INSTEAD OF ASSETS TO BE INVESTED IN.  AND IT'S IMPORTANT WE KEEP OUR EYE ON WHERE A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS FOR TOMORROW ARE COMING FROM. LESS REWARD COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY TRAINING AND SHARE PROFITS WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES. THAT'S THE KIND OF APPROACH THAT WILL BEGIN TO PUSH BACK ON QUARTERLY CAPITALISM. AND THE PRESSURES FROM ACTIVIST SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHERS WHO ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN JUST STRIPPING COMPANIES OF THEIR ASSETS, INCLUDING THEIR EMPLOYEES. SO I WILL LEAD THE FIGHT AGAINST REPUBLICAN ATTACKS ON PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FINANCIAL REFORM UNDER THE DODD FRANK LEGISLATION. AND FACT, I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT GETS THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR SAVING THIS ECONOMY AND CRACKING DOWN ON WALL STREET.  WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT THAT PROGRESS AND GO EVEN FURTHER. AND, YES, WE NEED SMARTER, FAIRER TRADE POLICIES. THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF DISTORTIONS OF MY RECORD ON TRADE. SO TONIGHT, I WANT TO SET THINGS STRAIGHT. TO EVERY WORKER IN WISCONSIN AND ACROSS AMERICA, IF I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE OUR PRESIDENT, I WILL STAND WITH YOU. I WILL HAVE YOUR BACK. AND I WILL STOP DEAD IN ITS TRACKS ANY DEAL THAT HURTS AMERICA. AND WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW IS I OPPOSED, WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE AND ACTUALLY HAD A VOTE, I HAVE POSED TO THE ONLY MULTILATERAL TRADE DEAL THEY CAME OUT. IT WAS CALLED CASTA, BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS BAD FOR AMERICAN JOBS. AND AS SECRETARY OF TRUE -- SECRETARY OF STATE, I THOUGHT FOR MANUFACTURERS -- I THOUGHT MANUFACTURERS -- THE PLANT -- AND THE PAN PACIFIC TRADE, I OPPOSED IT. IT IS TRUE THAT SENATOR SANDERS IS VERY CONSISTENT. HE HAS OPPOSED ALL TRADE DEALS ALL THE TIME. BUT I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT EITHER. BECAUSE WHEN TRADE IS DONE RIGHT, IT HELPS BUT THOUSANDS OF WISCONSIN COMPANIES IN A BETTER POSITION TO EXPORT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  -- BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF PRODUCTS. IN MY OPINION, WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO DOES NOT RAIL AGAINST TRADER WHO DOES NOT ENFORCE TRADE, BUT A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS HOW TO COMPETE AGAINST THE REST OF THE WORLD AND WIN FOR AMERICA AND FOR AMERICAN WORKERS.  THAT IS WHAT I DID WHEN I WAS A SENATOR. THAT IS WHY I HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO GO TO BAT FOR ME, TO TALK ABOUT WHY THEY TRUST ME, WHY THEY COUNT ON ME. BECAUSE I STOOD UP FOR THEM. I STOOD UP AGAINST UNFAIR TREATMENT BY CHINA AND OTHERS. I TESTIFIED FOR STEELWORKERS AGAINST DUMPING OF STEEL IN OUR COUNTRY. I WANT YOU TO KNOW, WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, IF I AM SO FORTUNATE TO BE THERE, NO ONE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US. NOT CHINA, NOT WALL STREET, AND NOT OVERPAID CORPORATE EXECUTIVES.  BUT I BELIEVE WE CAN' T STOP THERE. IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR US TO TELL YOU WHAT WE ARE AGAINST. WE HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT WE ARE FOR. WE HAVE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN IT -- IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING, TO GIVE AMERICANS THE SKILLS THEY NEED TO SUCCEED AT THE GOOD JOBS OF THE FUTURE. THAT STARTS WITH BEING SURE ALL OUR KIDS HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD SCHOOLS AND GOOD TEACHERS FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AND BEYOND, NO MATTER WHAT ZIP CODE THEY LIVE IN. BECAUSE WHEN WE INVEST IN OUR KIDS' EDUCATION, WE ARE INVESTING IN OUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE. WE ARE CREATING A STRONGER ECONOMY.  WE KNOW THAT, STILL TODAY, A WORKER WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE EARNS HALF $1 MILLION MORE OVER THERE WORKING LIFETIME. AND WHEN WE INVEST IN HIGHER EDUCATION, IT IN RICHES LIFE BE ON THE CLASSROOM. IT ALLOWS AN TO SPREAD FROM CAMPUS LABS TO BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THE COUNTRY. THIS IS A PRINCIPLE SO FUNDAMENTAL TO THIS STATE THAT IT IS CALLED THE WISCONSIN IDEA.  YOU KNOW, I WAS BORN IN CHICAGO. I GREW UP IN THE SUBURBS. I CAME TO WISCONSIN WHEN I WAS A YOUNG PERSON. I CAME TO CHURCH CAMP YOU I CAME TO GIRL SCOUT CAMP. WE WOULD TRAVEL AROUND WISCONSIN ON MANY WIKI AND VACATION. -- ON MANY WEEKEND OCCASIONS. AND I LOVE HAVE YOU TO FALL THIS DATE WAS. AND AS I GOT OLDER AND I LEARNED ABOUT THE PROGRESSIVE TRADITION IN WISCONSIN, I BECAME SUCH AN ADMIRER. I THOUGHT, WOW, WISCONSIN WAS AHEAD OF THE CURVE ON SOMEBODY IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT REALLY IMPROVE LIVES FOR AMERICANS. STOOD UP FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. AND THE WISCONSIN IDEA SPARKED MY IMAGINATION. SO IT IS TERRIBLE TO SEE THE DAMAGE GOVERNOR WALKER AND HIS ALLIES IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE DONE IN JUST FIVE YEARS. THEY HAVE CUT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM WISCONSIN'S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. THEY ROLLED BACK FINANCIALLY. THEY EVEN BLOCKED A PROPOSAL TO HELP PEOPLE REFINANCE THEIR STUDENT DEBT. SO INSTEAD OF INVESTING IN HIGHER EDUCATION, THEY ARE GETTING IT. -- GUTTING IT. THIS IS SO WRONG BECAUSE A WORLD -- THIS IS SO WRONG. AND HE HAS TO STOP BECAUSE A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION IS THE BIRTHRIGHT OF EVERY CHILD, EVERY PERSON IN WISCONSIN, EVERY AMERICAN, NOT A PRIVILEGE RESERVED FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. SENATOR SANDERS AND I BOTH AGREE ON THIS. IF WE WANT TO HELP MORE YOUNG PEOPLE GET A QUALITY, AFFORDABLE COLLEGE EDUCATION. BUT WE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT. EITHER MY PLAN, YOU WON'T HAVE TO BORROW A DIME FOR TUITION AT ANY PUBLIC COLLEGE. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FINANCE EXISTING DEBT AT MORE AFFORDABLE RATES. WHICH WILL SAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. AND BECAUSE MY PLAN IS A COMPACT, WE WILL WORK WITH STATES AND SCHOOLS TO CONTROL COSTS AND PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR GREATER PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION OVER TIME. BY CONTRAST, MY OPPONENT IS COUNTING ON GOVERNOR WALKER IN THE LEGISLATURE TO COME UP WITH $300 MILLION IN NEW FUNDING FOR HIGHER EDUCATION UP FRONT. THAT'S IRONIC BECAUSE THAT IS HOW MUCH GOVERNOR WALKER WANTED TO CUT LAST YEAR. HE ENDED UP COMING AS I'M TOLD, CUTTING $250 MILLION. SO IF YOU'RE PRECOLLEGE PLANNED COUNTS ON REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS LIKE GOVERNOR WALKER, THAT WILL TAKE SOME MAJOR CHANGE OF HEART. NOW I DO BELIEVE IN DEATHBED CONVERSIONS --    SO MAYBE IT WILL COME TO PASS. BUT I AM NOT COUNTING ON THAT. I WANT YOU TO GET DEBT FREE TUITION REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT  HERE AT -- ABOUT IT.  AND BESIDES, IF YOUR IDEA DOES NOT GET PASSED IN THE CONGRESS WE HAVE OR THEY DON'T WORK BECAUSE THE NUMBERS DO NOT ADD UP OR THEY DEPEND ON REPUBLICANS, WELL THEN WE ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE THE HELP THEY NEED RIGHT AWAY. THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO DO. I THINK THAT IS WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. HOW ARE WE GOING TO HELP YOU RIGHT NOW? AND THERE IS ONE MORE TELLER OF A GOOD JOBS AGENDA -- AND THAT IS GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT SUPPORTING UNIONS. UNIONS HELP BUILD THE STRONGEST MIDDLE-CLASS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.  JUST THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT THE HISTORY IN WISCONSIN. UNIONS LED THE FIGHT FOR AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS, BETTER WAGES. AND TODAY, THEY ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE MOVEMENT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE, WHICH WOULD LIFT MILLIONS OF FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY.  BUT HERE IN WISCONSIN, GOVERNOR WALKER HAS SPENT THE LAST FIVE YEARS STRIPPING WORKERS OF THEIR RIGHTS, LIMITING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING, AND DEVASTATING PUBLIC UNIONS. YOU HAVE SEEN THAT FIRSTHAND. IN THESE ATTACKS ON UNIONS ARE NOT JUST BAD FOR UNIONS AND THEIR MEMBERS. THEY ARE BAD FOR EVERYBODY. THEY DRIVE DOWN WAGES FOR EVERYBODY. THEY UNDERMINE THE KIND OF CHANGES WE NEED FOR EVERYBODY. THEY STOPPED OUR PROGRESS.  AND WHAT'S REALLY SCARY IS TED CRUZ AND THE OTHER REPUBLICAN -- SAY THEY WANT TO DO ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHAT SCOTT WALKER HAS DONE HERE, IMPOSING NATIONAL RIGHT TO WORK LAWS OF THAT WOULD DEPRESS WAGES AND BENEFITS UNDERCUT UNIONS, CONCENTRATE POWER IN THE HANDS OF CORPORATIONS AND THEIR ALLIES. THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE. -- SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS NOT ONLY WRONG, BUT WE MUST STOP THEM FROM EVER HAVING THE CHANCE TO TRY THAT.  ORGANIZED LABOR WILL ALWAYS HAVE A CHAMPION IN THE WHITE HOUSE IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT.  IN FACT, ALL WISCONSINITES AND AMERICANS WILL HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO HELPS BREAK DOWN ALL THE BARRIERS HOLDING AMERICANS BACK TO NOT JUST SOME, BUT ALL. NOW LOOK, TAKING BACK INCOME IN EQUAL -- TAKING ON INCOME INEQUALITY IS CRITICAL TO BUT SO IS TAKING ON RACIAL INEQUALITY AND DISCRIMINATION IN ALL OF ITS FORMS.  AND SO IS STANDING UP TO THE GUN LOBBY AND FIGHTING FOR COMMON SENSE SAFETY REFORM.  NOW MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF LIVING IN A SINGLE-ISSUE WORLD. YOU FACE A COMPLEX SET OF INTERSECTIONAL CHALLENGES. AND OUR NEXT PRESIDENT HAS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THEM ALL ON IN ORDER TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND THE SECOND BIG TEST FOR OUR COUNTRY SAFE. AT A TIME WHEN TERRORISTS ARE PLOTTING NEW ATTACKS AND COUNTRIES LIKE RUSSIA, CHINA AND IRAN ARE MAKING AGGRESSIVE MOVES, PROTECTING AMERICA'S NATURAL SECURITY -- NATIONAL SECURITY CANNOT BE AN AFTERTHOUGHT. AND A PRESIDENT HAS TO BE JUST AS PASSIONATE ABOUT DEFENDING OUR COUNTRY AS ABOUT FIXING OUR ECONOMY. ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, WELL WE ARE HEARING IS TRULY SCARY. WHEN DONALD TRUMP TALKS CASUALLY ABOUT USING TORTURE AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS, OR WHEN TED CRUZ CALLS FOR TREATING AMERICAN MUSLIMS LIKE CRIMINALS AND RELIGIOUSLY PROFILING THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS, THAT DOES NOT MAKE TRUMP AND CRUZ SOUND STRONG. IT MAKES THEM SOUND IN OVER THEIR HEADS.  YOU KNOW, LOOSE CANNONS TEND TO MISFIRE.  AND IN A DANGEROUS WORLD, THAT IS A GAMBLE WE CANNOT AFFORD. BUT THE TESTS OF THEIR -- BUT THE TEST REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FAIL MOST TERRIBLY IS THE THIRD ONE. INSTEAD OF BRINGING US TOGETHER, THEY SEEM DETERMINED TO DIVIDE US EVEN FURTHER. THEIR ENTIRE CAMPAIGNS ARE BASED ON PITTING US VERSUS THEM. DONALD TRUMP PLAYED COY WITH WHITE SUPREMACISTS. HE WANTS TO ROUNDUP MILLIONS OF LATINO IMMIGRANTS AND KICK THEM OUT OF THE UNITED STATES, A NATION BUILT BY IMMIGRANTS. HE WANTS TO BAN ALL MUSLIMS FROM ENTERING AMERICA, A COUNTRY FOUNDED ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. NOW A LOT OF REPUBLICANS MAY BE WRINGING THEIR HANDS OVER THE RISE OF DONALD TRUMP, BUT LOOK AT WISCONSIN AREA -- WISCONSIN. IT'S CLEAR MR. TRUMP IS JUST SAY WHAT OTHER REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS HAVE LONG BELIEVED.  YOU HAVE SEEN GOVERNOR WALKER PIT WISCONSINITES AGAINST ONE ANOTHER FOR YEARS, SCAPEGOATING TEACHERS, DEMONIZING PUBLIC WORKERS, GOING AFTER UNIONS, CLAIMING THEY DESTROY OUR COUNTRY. HE HAS MADE IT HIS PERSONAL MISSION TO ROLL BACK WOMEN'S RIGHTS. HE IS DEFUNDED PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND BAND ABORTION FOR 20 WEEKS WITH NO EXCEPTION FOR VICTIMS OF RAPE IN INCESSANT. HE DEFENDS BURDENSOME SOME, MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY, AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL TEXAS-STYLE REGULATION TO RESTRICT WOMEN'S RIGHTS TO MAKE OUR OWN HEALTH DECISIONS. AND RIGHT NOW -- RIGHT NOW, THERE IS A WALKER-OF WE DID JUDGE RUNNING FOR THE HIGHEST COURT IN THIS STATE.  SHE HAS ACTUALLY SAID -- I HAD TO READ THIS THREE TIMES --   SHE HAS ACTUALLY SAID BIRTH CONTROL IS MORALLY IMPORTANT AND DOCTORS WHO PROVIDED, NAMELY BIRTH CONTROL, AND WOMEN WHO USE IT, NAMELY BIRTH CONTROL, OUR PARTY TO MURDER. LEVY SAY THAT AGAIN. SHE -- LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. SHE COMPARED BIRTH CONTROL, WHICH MILLIONS OF WOMEN USE EVERY YEAR, TO MURDER. THERE IS NO PLACE ON ANY SUPREME COURT OR ANY COURT IN THIS COUNTRY --   NO PLACE AT ALL FOR REBECCA BRADLEY'S DECADES-LONG DANGEROUS RECORD AGAINST WOMEN, SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND THE LGBT COMMUNITY. SO TONIGHT, I AM ADDING MY VOICE SAYING NO TO DISCRIMINATION, NO TO HATE SPEECH, AND NOTE THE BRADLEY.  THIS IS NOT SOME SIDESHOW OR DISTRACTION. THE ASSAULT ON WOMEN'S ARE PRODUCTIVE RIGHT IS A SERIOUS ISSUE, WHICH STATES ACROSS AMERICA ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO PUT UP NEW BARRIERS, HOLDING OFF WOMEN'S S -- WOMEN'S ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. AND WHEN THE SUPREME COURT IS CONSIDERING THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE TO ROVE HE WEIGHED IN A GENERATION. WHICH IS WHY WE NEED TO STAND BY -- BEHIND PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HIS RIGHT TO FILL THE VACANCY ON THE COURT.  AND EVERY REPUBLICAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WANTS TO MAKE ABORTION ILLEGAL AND IT IS NOT SIMPLY TO OPPOSE ATTACKS ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS. WE NEED LEADERSHIP TO DEFEAT THEM. WHEN I TALK LIKE THIS, AND I OFTEN DO --   REPUBLICANS ACCUSE ME OF PLAYING THE GENDER CARD. WELL, IT WILL PAY AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS PLAYING THE GENDER CARD, THEN DEAL ME IN.  YOU KNOW, I COME TO THESE ISSUES IS A WOMAN, A MOTHER, A GRANDMOTHER, A LAWYER, A FORMER FIRST LADY, SENATOR, SECRETARY OF STATE, AND I'VE TRAVELED THE PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE GOVERNMENT CONTROL OVER WOMEN'S BODIES CONFINES THEM TO SECOND SLAP -- SECOND-CLASS STATUS. MY HAVE BEEN IN THE TRENCHES OF -- TRENCHES ALONGSIDE GROUPS LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOR DECADES, FIGHTING THE ATTACKS ON WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, WOMEN'S EQUALITY TO MAKE DECISIONS HERE AT HOME AND AROUND THE GLOBE. AND I AM HONORED THAT THEY HAVE ENDORSED ME IN THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE I WILL KEEP FIGHTING. I WILL FIGHT AGAINST ANYONE ANYWHERE WHO WANTS TO SET WOMEN'S LIVES AND WRITES BACK. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP GOING FORWARD. THAT IS THE DIRECTION THAT WE WILL HAVE TOGETHER.  NOW FOR ME, EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD FROM DONALD TRUMP, TED CRUZ, THE OTHER REPUBLICANS, HAVE CONVINCED ME THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR WOMEN OR OUR RIGHTS. ONE OF MY FAVORITE AMERICANS, MAYA ANGELOU, SAID, WHEN SOMEONE SHOWS YOU WHO THEY ARE, BELIEVE THEM.  WELL, TODAY'S REPUBLICAN LEADERS ARE SHOWING US WHO THEY ARE AND WE SHOULD BELIEVE THEM. WE NEED TO STAND UP FOR THAT TEST STAND UP TO THEM AT EVERY LEVEL. WE KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO COME -- WE NEED TO STAND UP TO THEM AT EVERY LEVEL. WE KNOW THEY ARE COMING. THEY WILL DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO GET THE WHITE HOUSE. THIS MAY SEEM OBVIOUS TO VIEW, -- DO YOU, BUT WE NEED A NOMINEE WHO HAS BEEN TESTED AND THAT IT ALREADY. AND FOR A 25 YEARS, THEY HAVE THROWN EVERYTHING THEY COULD,, BUT I AM STILL STANDING.  AND I AM READY TO TAKE ON THIS FIGHT AND WIN WITH YOU AND FOR YOU. SO, YES, WE NEED TO KEEP A DEMOCRAT THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT WE CAN'T STOP THERE. IF I'M FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO EARN THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION, I WILL HAVE YOUR BACK AGAINST GOVERNOR WALKER AND THE TEA PARTY LEGISLATURE HERE IN WISCONSIN. I WILL CAMPAIGN TO ELECT DEMOCRATS AT EVERY LEVEL. TOGETHER, WE WILL TAKE BACK THE STATE LEGISLATURE. AND IN 2018, WE WILL DEFEAT SCOTT WALKER.  AND I AM THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE WHO HAS PLEDGED TO RAISE MONEY TO HELP PLEDGE OUR PARTY. I WANT TO BE YOUR PARTNER FOR THE LONG HAUL, NOT JUST WHEN I'M ON THE BALLOT, NOT JUST IN ELECTION YEARS. BAKE AS WE ARE GOING TO TAKE BACK THE STATE, THIS PROGRESSIVE STATE OF THE FOLLETT AND NELSON AND COAL AND FEINGOLD AND BALDWIN!  SO MY FRIENDS, PLEASE JOIN US. GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM. CONTRIBUTE OR YOU CAN. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I NEED YOUR SET ORDER ON TUESDAY AND THE PRIMARY. PLEASE, COME OUT AND VOTE. COME OUT AND GO FOR RESULTS THAT WILL MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. COME OUT AND GO FOR A COMMANDER IN CHIEF THAT WILL KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE. COME OUT AND VOTE FOR SOMEONE WHO WILL, AS SHE HAS ALWAYS DONE, FIND COMMON GROUND WHILE STANDING MY GROUND. LET'S HAIR DOWN ALL THE VARIOUS HOLDING US BACK. LET'S WIN.

HILLARY! HILLARY! HILLARY! HILLARY!  WOW! THANK YOU. MY GOODNESS. I TELL YOU WHAT, IT IS A THRILL TO BE LIVE AT THE APOLLO WITH ALL OF YOU.  IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE BACK HOME IN NEW YORK. IT IS EXTRAORDINARY TO STAND HERE AND LOOK OUT AT THIS CROWD, PLEASE BE SEATED. YOU CAN JUMP UP AGAIN FROM TIME TO TIME.  I AM SITTING HERE -- STANDING HERE LOOKING OUT AND SEEING SO MANY FRIENDS. SO MANY PEOPLE I HAVE WORKED WITH, I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF KNOWING. IT IS A SPECIAL TREAT TO HAVE MY FORMER COLLEAGUE AND PARTNER, SOMEONE WHO I HOPE AND EXPECT WILL NOT ONLY BE THE LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE BUT, IF WE DO OUR PART, HE WILL BE THE MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE.  I AM SO GRATEFUL TO CHECK -- CHUCK, WE HAD EIGHT YEARS WORKING SIDE-BY-SIDE, DEALING WITH PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES. THAT EXPERIENCE WAS ONE OF THE GREAT HONORS OF MY LIFE. I WANT TO MAKE KNOWLEDGE -- ACKNOWLEDGMENT LONGTIME FRIEND, THE PERSON I GIVE CREDIT TO FOR STARTING MAIN ON THIS JOURNEY -- STARTING THE ON THIS JOURNEY. THAT IS CONGRESSMAN CHARLIE WRANGLE -- RANGLE. I SEE THE MANHATTAN BOROUGH PRESIDENT, GALE BREWER. AND TO ALL THE OTHER ELECTED OFFICIAL, FRIENDS, SUPPORTERS, I LOVE COMING TO HARLEM. THIS COMMUNITY HAS MADE ME AND MY FAMILY FEEL LIKE A PART OF YOUR FAMILY. I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND FRIENDSHIP. WITH YOUR HELP WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE PRIMARY HERE ON APRIL 19.  AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION AND THE ELECTION IN  NOVEMBER.  LET ME GIVE YOU A SHORT SUMMARY OF WHERE WE ARE. I HAVE COMPETED ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. I AM HONORED TO HAVE RECEIVED NEARLY 9 MILLION VOTES.  THAT IS MORE THAN A MILLION MORE THAN DONALD TRUMP HAS RECEIVED. AND 2.5 MILLION MORE THAN SENATOR SANDERS. WE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK.  BUT, I DO NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU, THIS IS A WILD ELECTION YEAR. I AM NOT TAKING ANYTHING OR ANYONE FOR GRANTED. WE WILL WORK FOR EVERY VOTE AND EVERY PART OF THIS STATE JUST LIKE I DID WHEN I RAN FOR THE SENATE. BECAUSE NEW YORKERS TOOK A CHANCE FOR ME AND I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT. YOU HAVE ALWAYS HAD MY BACK. I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO HAVE YOURS. WHEN I THINK BACK TO THE EIGHT EVENTFUL YEARS THAT I SERVE YOU, THERE WERE SOME HARD TIMES. BUT WE PULLED TOGETHER. NONE OF US WHO LIVED THROUGH 9/11 AND ITS AFTERMATH WILL NEVER FORGET THE LIVES LOST. LOWER MANHATTAN IN RUINS. TOXIC DUST AND DEBRIS RAINING DOWN. AND THE MANY EXAMPLES OF HEROISM WE SAW, THE FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS WHO RISKED THEIR LIVES TO HELP SAVE OTHERS. THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND EMERGENCY PERSONNEL AND VOLUNTEERS WHO SPENT LONG HOURS ON THE SMOLDERING PILES SEARCHING FOR SURVIVORS AND MONTHS MORE CLEARING THE SITE. ALL OF THE NEW YORKERS WHO LINED UP TO DONATE BLOOD, WHO REACHED OUT TO FAMILIES IN A MILLION QUIET, DECENT WAYS. THEY PROJECTED A SENSE OF STRENGTH AND UNITY THAT COMFORTED THE WHOLE COUNTRY. AS THE DUST SETTLED, NEW YORKERS ROLLED UP OUR SLEEVES AND WE GOT TO WORK. LIKE FORMER FIRE COMMISSIONER NEXT UP AT A -- NICK, WHO WE LOST LAST WEEK, A GREAT LEADER. A CHAMPION FOR HIS FIREFIGHTERS, FOR CHILDREN, AND FOR THE CITY. NEW YORK WANTED TO REBUILD SO CHECK -- CHUCK AND I THOUGHT FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDING TO GET IT DONE. -- FOUGHT FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDING TO GET IT DONE AND WE CAN SEE THE RESULTS. LOWER MANHATTAN HAS RISEN HIGHER AND MORE MAGNIFICENTLY. WHEN FIRST RESPONDERS AND OTHERS STARTED SUFFERING ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS FROM 9/11, A LOT OF PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON DID NOT WANT TO PAYI KEPT RAISING THE ALARM. I HOPE HEARING. THAT TRY TO GET THE ATTENTION OF THE EPA AND BUSH ADMINISTRATION. THEY JUST BRUSHED US OFF, ACTING AS THOUGH IT WASN'T ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY. THEN I GOT TO WORK WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION. TO GET OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND OTHERS THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY NEEDED. IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT THESE THE DRUG A ACT IS NOW ENSURING THAT PEOPLE WHO DID SO MUCH FOR US ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN CARE OF THEIR ENTIRE LIVES.  BUT WHILE ALL OF THIS WAS GOING ON, REPUBLICANS, LED BY GEORGE BUSH, STARTED SQUANDERING THE SURPLUS THEY HAD INHERITED FROM MY HUSBAND'S TO TERMS ON MASSIVE TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY. THEY SET A RECKLESS FISCAL AND REGULATORY COURSE THAT EVENTUALLY TANKED OUR ENTIRE ECONOMY. TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS MADE LIFE HARDER FOR WORKING PEOPLE HERE IN OUR STATES.  SO, WE HAD TO GET CREATIVE, DIDN'T WE? WE WORKED WITH SMALL BUSINESSES TO HELP THEM USE TECHNOLOGY TO REACH CUSTOMERS. TO ATTRACT HIGH-TECH RESEARCH PROJECTS TO CREATE MORE GOOD PAYING JOBS. I CONNECTED CHEFS AND RESTAURANT OWNERS TO FARMERS AND WINEMAKERS IN THE HUDSON VALLEY AND FINGER LAKES. WE WERE LOOKING FOR ANYTHING THAT WOULD CREATE MORE JOBS, MORE MARKETS AND MORE OPPORTUNITIES. MORE SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS SO THAT ALL OF OUR KIDS COULD GET A GOOD EDUCATION, NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE.  CHILDREN IN EVERY BOROUGH OF THE CITY DESERVE THE SAME CHANCE TO SUCCEED AS CHILDREN IN WESTCHESTER, OR ON LONG ISLAND, OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN AMERICA.  BECAUSE FOR ME IT'S REALLY SIMPLE, WHEN WE INVEST IN OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION WE INVEST IN OUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE AND IN A STRONGER ECONOMY FOR ALL OF US. YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT NEW YORK IS THAT NEW YORKERS HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT IF YOU WORK HARD AND YOU DO YOUR PART YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. THAT IS HOW I SAW MY JOB IS YOUR SENATOR. MY JOB WAS TO HELP MAKE THAT POSSIBLE FOR AS MANY PEOPLE AS I COULD. BOY, DID I LEARN A LOT SERVING THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE. NOW, I AM ONCE AGAIN ASKING FOR YOUR CONFIDENCE IN YOUR VOTE. -- AND YOUR VOTE.   YOU KNOW --   YOU KNOW, I THINK -- I THINK THE EASIEST WAY TO DESCRIBE WHAT MY CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT, IT'S ABOUT BREAKING DOWN THE BARRIERS THAT ARE HOLDING PEOPLE BACK FROM SHARING IN THE PROMISE OF AMERICA. HERE IS WHAT I BELIEVE. ANYONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THIS YEAR FACES THREE BIG TESTS. FIRST, CAN YOU DELIVER RESULTS THAT IMPROVE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE?  SECOND, CAN YOU KEEP US SAFE?  THIRD, CAN YOU BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER AGAIN?  EVERY CANDIDATE SHOULD BE JUDGED BY THESE TESTS. MAKING IT A REAL DIFFERENCE FOR PEOPLE AND FAMILIES COMES FIRST. AMERICANS EVERYWHERE ARE HUNGRY FOR SOLUTIONS. WE CAN CREATE MORE GOOD JOBS WITH RISING INCOMES BY INVESTING IN MANUFACTURING AND SMALL BUSINESS. INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLEAN ENERGY. ENOUGH CLEAN ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME IN AMERICA IN 10 YEARS. WE WILL MAKE COMPANIES THAT SHIFT JOBS OVERSEAS GIVE BACK THE TAX BREAKS THEY GOT HERE AT HOME.  IF THEY TRY TO MOVE THEIR HEADQUARTERS TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY TO SKIP OUT ON THAT TAX TELLS, WE WILL SLAP A NEW EXIT TAX ON THEM. THEN WE WILL PUT THAT MONEY TO WORK IN THE COMMUNITIES AND THE PEOPLE THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND. WE CAN BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS HOLDING BACK THE PEOPLE IN THIS ECONOMY. ISN'T IT TIME FOR QUALITY AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE, EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION, AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE? ISN'T IT TIME FOR RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE NATIONWIDE?  AND ISN'T IT TIME FINALLY TO GUARANTEE EQUAL PAY FOR THE WOMEN WHO WORK?   YOU SEE, I THINK WE ARE LUCKY IN NEW YORK. BECAUSE THESE ARE GOALS THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE MAYOR ARE FIGHTING FOR AND ACHIEVING HERE. I WILL FIGHT FOR THEM AS PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW, REPUBLICANS ALWAYS SAY WHEN I TALK LIKE THIS THAT I'M PLAYING THE GENDER CARD. MY RESPONSE IS PRETTY SIMPLE. IF FIGHTING FOR EQUAL PAY AND PAID LEAVE IS PLAYING THE GENDER CARD, THEN DEAL ME IN.  YOU KNOW, I ALSO THINK WE CAN BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS HOLDING BACK ON YOUNG PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY THE BURDEN OF STUDENT DEBT THAT MAKES IT SO HARD FOR THEM.  UNDER MY PLAN, YOU WON'T HAVE TO BORROW A DIME FOR TUITION AT ANY PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO REFINANCE THE DEBT THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE, JUST LIKE A MORTGAGE OR A CAR LOAN. I'VE BEEN TOLD OF THIS HAS LISTED MILLIONS PEOPLE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. WE CAN BREAK DOWN THE ROOT -- THE BARRIERS OF SYSTEMIC RACISM. WE CAN INVEST IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, REFORM OUR BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, REPLACE THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE WITH A CRADLE TO COLLEGE PIPELINE.  WE CAN REJECT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST LG BT PEOPLE, LIKE THE SHAMEFUL LAW PASSED IN NORTH CAROLINA.  WE CAN DEFEND OUR RIGHTS, OUR CIVIL RIGHTS AND VOTING RIGHTS, WORKERS RIGHTS AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS, GAY RIGHTS, RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THE REPUBLICANS TURN US BACK AND RIP AWAY THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE. THAT STARTS BY STANDING WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA AND DEMANDING THAT REPUBLICAN SENATORS DO THEIR JOB AND VOTE FOR A NOMINEE ON THE SUPREME COURT.  SO, I BELIEVE -- I BELIEVE WE CAN BREAK DOWN ALL THESE BARRIERS AND MORE IF WE STAND TOGETHER. IF WE WORK TOGETHER. FOR ME IT'S ALL ABOUT GETTING RESULTS. YOU KNOW, WHEN I JOINED WITH PARENTS, DOCTORS, AND COMMUNITY LEADERS TO TAKE ON THE EPIDEMIC OF CHILDREN'S ASTHMA RIGHT HERE IN HARLEM, IT WASN'T ABOUT MAKING A POINT. IT WAS ABOUT MAKING A DIFFERENCE. AS YOUR SENATOR AND IN EVERY JOB I'VE EVER HELD I HAVE WORKED MY HEART OUT TO EVEN THE ODDS THAT HAVE OFTEN BEEN STACKED AGAINST TOO MANY PEOPLE. SOME FOLKS MAY HAVE THE LUXURY TO HOLD OUT FOR THE PERFECT, BUT A LOT OF AMERICANS ARE HURTING RIGHT NOW. THEY NEED THE GOOD AND THEY NEED IT TODAY. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN LIKE YOU DO IN LIFE AND IN POLITICS, YOU HAVE TO GET BACK UP AND KEEP ON WORKING TO MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER. WHEN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY BLOCKED THE PUSH FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY AMERICAN, AS CHUCK SAID, I PARTNERED WITH AMERICANS AND DEMOCRATS TO CREATE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAMS. THAT HELPED A LOT OF KIDS AND FAMILIES HERE IN NEW YORK AND 8 MILLION CHILDREN ACROSS AMERICA. SO, WHEN ANY CANDIDATE COMES BEFORE YOU, THAT CANDIDATE OWES IT TO YOU TO BE CLEAR ABOUT HOW WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO DELIVER. MY OPPONENT AND I SHARE MANY OF THE SAME GOALS. BUT SOME OF HIS IDEAS FOR HOW TO GET THERE WON'T PASS. OTHERS JUST WON'T WORK. THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE WON'T GET THE HEALTH THAT -- THE HELP THAT THEY NEED IN DESERVE. THAT IS WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. MY OPPONENT SAYS WE ARE NOT THINKING BIG ENOUGH. WELL, THIS IS NEW YORK. NOBODY DREAMS BIGGER THAN WE DO.  BUT THIS -- BUT THIS IS A CITY THAT LIKES TO GET THINGS DONE. THAT IS WHAT WE WANT FROM OUR POOR -- FROM OUR PRESIDENT, TOO. A PRESIDENT THAT WILL HELP TO BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS HOLDING DOWN AMERICANS. NOT JUST SOME. I TAKE A BACKSEAT TO NO ONE WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING ON INCOME INEQUALITY. I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO CLOSE THAT GAP. TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO TAKE ON RACIAL INEQUALITY AND DISCRIMINATION IN ALL OF ITS FORMS.   AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO STAND UP TO THE GUN LOBBY AND FIGHT FOR COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY REFORM.  YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER -- I REMEMBER THAT MEETING. I REMEMBER THE MEETING THAT CHUCK WAS TALKING ABOUT. PEOPLE WERE GETTING COLD FEET. FOLKS TALK ABOUT ALL THE POWERFUL LOBBIES IN WASHINGTON. LOOK, THERE ARE A BUNCH OF THEM. NOTHING, NO ONE IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE GUN LOBBY. I UNDERSTOOD WHY SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WERE SAYING -- MY GOSH, WE CAN'T DO THIS. SOME FOLKS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE ADMINISTRATION WERE GETTING NERVOUS. I THOUGHT THEN AND I BELIEVE NOW, WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO SAVE LIVES, WE MUST DO. I REMEMBER HOW HARD IT WAS TO GET THE BRADY BILL PASSED. MY OPPONENT VOTED AGAINST FIVE TIMES, AS I RECALL. HE HAS SIDED WITH THE NRA ON THE IMPORTANT VOTES OF THE LAST 20 YEARS. THIS ISN'T A SINGLE ISSUE COUNTRY. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN DO ALL ARTS OF THE JOB. BECAUSE THE SECOND TEST IS KEEPING US SAFE. AT A TIME WHEN TERRORISTS ARE PLOTTING NEW ATTACKS AND COUNTRIES LIKE RUSSIA, CHINA, AND IRAN ARE MAKING MOVES TO PROTECT AMERICAN NET -- MAKING THOSE, PROTECTING AMERICAN NATIONAL SECURITY CANNOT BE AN AFTERTHOUGHT. OUR NEXT PRESIDENT HAS TO BE JUST AS PASSIONATE. I WILL DO BOTH. WHEN YOU VOTE ON APRIL 19 IN NEW YORK, YOU ARE VOTING FOR A PRESIDENT AND A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.  LET'S FACE IT, LET'S FACE IT, ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE WHAT WE ARE HEARING IS TRULY SCARY. WHEN DONALD TRUMP TALKS CASUALLY ABOUT USING TORTURE AND ALLOWING MORE COUNTRIES TO GET NUCLEAR WEAPONS, OR WHEN TED CRUZ CALLS FOR TREATING AMERICAN MUSLIMS LIKE CRIMINALS AND RACIALLY PROFILING PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM NEIGHBORHOODS, THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEM SOUND STRONG. IT MAKES THEM SOUND IN OVER THEIR HEADS. YOU KNOW, LOOSE CANNONS TEND TO MISFIRE. IN A DANGEROUS WORLD THAT'S NOT A GAMBLE THAT WE CAN AFFORD. BUT THE TEST OF THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FAILS MOST SPECTACULARLY WHEN WE GET TO THE THIRD TEST. BECAUSE INSTEAD OF BRINGING US TOGETHER, THEY SEEMED -- THEY SEEM DETERMINED TO DIVIDE US EVEN FURTHER. THEIR ENTIRE CAMPAIGNS ARE BASED ON PITTING US VERSUS THEM. ONE OF MY PERSONAL HEROINES, MY ANGELINA, SAID -- SHE HAS DONE A LOT THAT IS WORTH REMEMBERING, BUT SHE SAID THIS -- WHEN SOMEONE SHOWS YOU WHO THEY ARE, BELIEVE THEM.  THESE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES ARE SHOWING US EXACTLY WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT. AND WE SHOULD BELIEVE THEM. JUST LISTEN TO DONALD TRUMP. HE PLAYS COY WITH WHITE SUPREMACISTS. HE SAYS DEMEANING AND DEGRADING THINGS ABOUT WOMEN. HE WANTS TO ROUND UP MILLIONS OF LATINO IMMIGRANTS AND KICK THEM OUT OF THE UNITED STATES. A NATION BUILT BY IMMIGRANTS. HE WANTS TO BAN ALL MUSLIMS FROM ENTERING AMERICA. A COUNTRY FOUNDED ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. IT CYNICAL, IT'S WRONG, AND IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING NEW YORK AND AMERICA STAND FOR.  ONE OF THE GREAT JOYS OF MY TIME AT SENATOR WAS TRAVELING ACROSS THIS CITY AND STATE. NEW YORK IS HOME TO 20 MILLION PEOPLE. WE DON'T ALL LOOK THE SAME. WE DON'T ALL SOUND THE SAME OR WORSHIP THE SAME EITHER. BUT WE PULL TOGETHER. WHEN A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT SAYS THAT WE CAN SOLVE AMERICA'S PROBLEMS BY BUILDING WALLS, DISCRIMINATING AGAINST PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR RELIGION AND TURNING AGAINST EACH OTHER -- WELL, NEW YORKERS KNOW BETTER.  OUR DIVERSITY IS A STRENGTH, NOT A WEAKNESS. NEW YORK REPRESENTS THE BEST OF AMERICA. TOGETHER, WE CAN FACE DOWN THE WORST. LOOK AROUND YOU, YOU WILL SEE A RISING GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE MORE DIVERSE, TOLERANT, AND CONNECTED THAN ANY WE HAVE EVER SEEN.  WE SHOULD BUILD ON THAT SPIRIT. NOT SQUASH IT. I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART THAT IF WE REACH FOR LOVE AND KINDNESS INSTEAD OF BLUSTER AND BIGOTRY, THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO IF WE PUT OUR MINDS TO IT.  LET ME LEAVE YOU WITH ONE STORY THAT SAYS IT ALL. MOHAMMED SOLMAN WAS BORN IN PAKISTAN AND MOVED TO AMERICA WITH HIS PARENTS WHEN HE WAS 13 MONTHS OLD. THEY WERE LIKE ANY OTHER NEW YORK FAMILY. MOM WAS A MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER. DAD OWNED A STORE. MOHAMMED GREW UP, STUDIED BIOCHEMISTRY AT QUEENS COLLEGE. GOT TRAINED AS A PARAMEDIC AND BECAME A CADET WITH THE NYPD. HE WASN'T SURE WHAT HE WANTED TO DO WITH HIS LIFE, BUT HE KNEW HE WANTED TO HELP PEOPLE. HE WAS JUST 23 WHEN TERRORISTS FLEW PLANES INTO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER. WHEN HE HEARD THE NEWS, HE DIDN'T HESITATE. HE GRABBED HIS MEDICAL BAD -- MEDICAL BAG AND HEADED STRAIGHT TO THE SITE. LIKE SO MANY OTHERS, HE DIED TRYING TO SAVE TOTAL STRANGERS. BECAUSE HIS BOUGHT -- BODY WAS BURIED DEEP UNDER THE RUBBLE, NEITHER HIS FAMILY NOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT NEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM. FOR MONTHS HE WAS CONSIDERED MISSING. SOME WONDERED AT THIS YOUNG MAN WITH A MUSLIM NAME AND A BACKGROUND IN SCIENCE COULD HAVE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE ATTACKS. ONCE PEOPLE KNEW, THEY REALIZED HOW LONG THEY HAD GOTTEN IT. HE WASN'T A TERRORIST. HE WAS A HERO. NEW YORK GAVE HIM A HERO'S FUNERAL WITH FULL POLICE HONORS. BECAUSE, AS HIS MOTHER SAID --   AS HIS MOTHER SAID, THIS CADET AND PARAMEDIC RAN TOWARDS THE BURNING TOWERS WHEN EVERYONE WAS RUNNING AWAY. MOHAMMED WAS AN IMMIGRANT. HE WAS A NEW YORKER. HE WAS AN AMERICAN AND HE DIED TRYING TO HELP OTHERS LIVE. IT'S UP TO US TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS AND SO MANY OTHERS SACRIFICE STILL COUNTS FOR SOMETHING. WE DO THAT BY STANDING UP AGAINST BIGOTRY IN ALL ITS FORMS. BY CELEBRATING HEROISM WHEREVER WE FIND IT AND DOING OUR PART TO SERVE OTHERS AND MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AND STRONGER. THAT IS WHAT COUNTLESS NEW YORKERS DO EVERY DAY IN A MILLION QUIET WAYS. SO, WE ARE GOING TO STAND UP FOR THE VALUES THAT MAKE NEW YORK GREAT AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT.  DON'T FORGET, DON'T EVER FORGET. THIS IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH AND WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR IT, FIGHT FOR OUR FUTURE. PLEASE JOIN ME IN THIS CAMPAIGN. LET'S HAVE EACH OTHER'S BACKS. LIFT EACH OTHER UP. BREAK DOWN ALL THE BARRIERS HOLDING US BACK, REACHING THE FULL POTENTIAL THAT WE SHOULD REALIZE. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. THANK YOU, NEW YORK. YOU ARE INCREDIBLE.

WHAT HAPPENS IN VLADASTAG STAYS   THERE. I AM DELIGHTED TO BE BACK HERE   AT STANFORD, AND I WILL NEVER   FORGET THE DAY WE FIRST BROUGHT   CHELSEA HERE.   I BROUGHT HER TO VISIT WHEN SHE   WAS THINKING ABOUT SCHOOLS BUT I KNOW AS SOON AS SHE SAW   STANFORD THIS IS WHERE IF SHE   WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE   ADMITTED SHE WOULD CERTAINLY   CHOOSE TO COME.   AND THEN, OF COURSE, I REMEMBER WHEN BILL AND I BROUGHT HER HERE TO BEGIN HER FRESHMAN YEAR   AND THEN THE DINNER FOR PARENTS   THAT MIKE WAS REFERRING TO, SO IT'S A GREAT TREAT TO BE BACK   AND NOW THAT MY DAUGHTER IS A MOTHER HERSELF, YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE'S ALREADY TALK -- AT   LEAST AMONG ONE OR TWO MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILY, SINCE HER HUSBAND IS ALSO AN ALUM OF   STANFORD, HOW GOOD CHARLOTTE   WOULD LOOK ONE DAY IN CARDINAL RED.  I AM DELIGHTED TO BE HERE WITH   SOME VERY DISTINGUISHED GUESTS. SECRETARY SCHULTZ, SECRETARY PERY THANK YOU, BOTH, FOR BEING HERE WITH US. LANNY, THANK YOU.   AND MARCOS, THANK YOU.  AND OTHERS.   IT'S REALLY A GREAT TREAT TO BE   NOT ONLY AT THE UNIVERSITY BUT   AT THIS PARTICULAR INSTITUTE AS WELL. YOU HAVE REALLY MADE STANFORD A   CENTER FOR NATIONAL SECURITY SCHOLARSHIP AND THAT IS THE PRINCIPAL REASON WHY I AM HERE TODAY.  YESTERDAY'S ATTACK IN BRUSSELS WAS THE LATEST BRUTAL REMINDER THAT OUR FIGHT AGAINST ISIS AND RADICAL JIHADIST TERRORISM IS   FAR FROM FINISHED.  MORE THAN 30 INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE DEAD.   MEN AND WOMEN HURRYING TO CATCH A PLANE, WAITING FOR A TRAIN OR   MEETING A LOVED ONE.  HUNDREDS MORE ARE WOUNDED, INCLUDING THREE MORMON   MISSIONARIES FROM UTAH.   A U.S. AIR FORCE OFFICER, HIS   WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN, AND   OTHER AMERICANS.  IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT   AMERICANS HERE AT HOME ARE   WORRIED. THE THREAT WE FACE FROM   TERRORISM IS REAL, IT'S URGENT   AND IT KNOWS NO BOUNDARIES. EVEN AS BRUSSELS GRIEVES, THE   MEMORIES OF PARIS AND SAN   BERNARDINO ARE PAINFULLY FRESH   AS WELL. ON SATURDAY, A BOMBING IN   ISTANBUL KILLED FOUR PEOPLE,   INCLUDING TWO U.S.-ISRAELI DUAL   CITIZENS. MANY OTHER PLACES HAVE BEEN   TARGETED IN THE PAST YEAR ALONE.  HOTELS IN WEST AFRICA, BEACHES IN TUNISIA, A MARKET IN LEBANON, A RUSSIAN PASSENGER JET IN THE SINAI.   ISIS IS ATTEMPTING A GENOCIDE OF RELIGIOUS AND ETHNIC   MINORITIES. IT BEHEADS CIVILIANS. IT ENSLAVES, TORTURES AND RAPES   WOMEN AND GIRLS.  WALLS WILL NOT PROTECT US FROM THIS THREAT.  WE CANNOT CONTAIN ISIS. WE MUST DEFEAT ISIS. IT THIS WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST   IMPORTANT CHALLENGES FACING THE   NEXT PRESIDENT WHO TAKES OFFICE ON JANUARY 20. OUR NEW COMMANDER IN CHIEF WILL WALK INTO THE OVAL OFFICE AND   FIND A WORLD OF HARD CHOICES AND COMPLEX PROBLEMS. THAT PRESIDENT WILL SIT DOWN AT THE DESK AND START MAKING DECISIONS THAT WILL AFFECT THE LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS OF EVERY AMERICAN AND PEOPLE AROUND THE   WORLD. SO THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER.   TODAY, I WANT TO EMPHASIZE   THREE POINTS. FIRST, WE FACE AN ADVERSARY   THAT IS CONSTANTLY ADAPTING AND   OPERATING ACROSS MULTIPLE THEATERS, SO OUR RESPONSE MUST   BE JUST AS NIMBLE AND FAR REACHING. SECOND, TO DEFEAT THIS   TRANSNATIONAL THREAT, WE NEED TO REINFORCE THE ALLIANCES THAT   HAVE BEEN CORE PILLARS OF   AMERICAN POWER FOR DECADES.   AND THIRD, WE NEED TO RELY ON WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS, NOT BLUSTER THAT ALIENATES OUR   PARTNERS AND DOESN'T MAKE US ANY SAFER.  LET'S BEGIN BY BEING CLEAR   ABOUT WHAT WE ARE FACING.   ISIS CONTROLS A SHRINKING BUT STILL SIZEABLE TERRITORY IN   IRAQ AND SYRIA.   IT LEADS A FAR-FLUNG NETWORK THAT INCLUDES AFFILIATES ACROSS   THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH   AFRICA AND CELLS IN EUROPE,   ASIA AND EVEN HERE IN NORTH   AMERICA. IT'S ALSO PART OF A BROADER IDEOLOGICAL MOVEMENT THAT INCLUDES OTHER TERRORIST   GROUPS. WE NEED TO DO BATTLE ON ALL THESE FRONTS.   LAST YEAR, IN SPEECHES IN NEW   YORK AND MINNEAPOLIS, I LAID   OUT A THREE-PART PLAN TO DEFEAT   ISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AROUND   THE WORLD AND HERE AT HOME.   RECENT EVENTS HAVE ONLY REINFORCED THE URGENCY OF THIS MISSION.  FIRST, WE DO HAVE TO TAKE OUT   ISIS' STRONG HOLD IN IRAQ AND SYRIA.  WE SHOULD INTENSIFY THE COALITION AIR CAMPAIGN AGAINST ITS FIGHTERS, LEADERS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. STEP UP SUPPORT FOR LOCAL ARAB   AND KURDISH FORCES ON THE GROUND, AND COALITION EFFORTS TO PROTECT CIVILIANS.   AND PURSUE A DIPLOMATIC STRATEGY AIMED AT ACHIEVING POLITICAL RESOLUTIONS, SYRIA'S CIVIL WAR AND IRAQ'S SECTARIAN DIVIDE. SECOND, WE MUST DISMANTLE THE   GLOBAL NETWORK OF TERROR THAT SUPPLIES MONEY, ARMS,   PROPAGANDA AND FIGHTERS.  THIS MEANS TARGETED EFFORTS TO   DEAL WITH ISIS' AFFILIATES FROM   LIBYA TO AFGHANISTAN.   IT MEANS GOING AFTER THE KEY ENABLERS WHO FACILITATE ILLICIT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND HELP JIHADISTS TO ARRANGE TRAVEL,   FORGE DOCUMENTS AND EVADE   DETECTIONS, AND IT MEANS WAGING ONLINE BATTLES WITH EXTREMISTS TO DISCREDIT THEIR IDEOLOGY, EXPOSE THEIR LIES AND COUNTER   THEIR APPEALS TO POTENTIAL   RECRUITS IN THE WEST AND AROUND THE WORLD.  THIRD, WE MUST HARDEN OUR   DEFENSES AND BUILD OUR   RESILIENCE HERE AT HOME.  WE NEED TO COUNTER EACH STEP IN   THE PROCESS THAT CAN LEAD TO AN ATTACK.   DETERRING WOULD-BE TERRORISTS AND DISCOVERING AND DISRUPTING PLOTS BEFORE THEY'RE CARRIED   OUT. OUR ENEMIES ARE CONSTANTLY   ADAPTING, SO WE HAVE TO DO THE SAME.   FOR EXAMPLE, BRUSSELS DEMONSTRATED CLEARLY WE NEED TO   TAKE A HARDER LOOK AT SECURITY   PROTOCOLS AT AIRPORTS AND OTHER SENSITIVE SO-CALLED SOFT SITES, ESPECIALLY AREAS OUTSIDE GUARDED PERIMETERS. TO DO ALL THIS, WE NEED AN INTELLIGENCE SURGE AND SO DO OUR ALLIES. WE ALSO HAVE TO STAY AHEAD OF THE CURVE TECHNOLOGICALLY.  THAT DOES MEAN WORK CAN GO WITH THE BRIGHTEST MINDS HERE IN SILICON VALLEY TO MORE EFFECTIVELY TRACK AND ANALYZE ISIS' SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS AND   MAP JIHADIST NETWORKS ONLINE. WHEN OTHER CANDIDATES TALK ABOUT BUILDING WALLS AROUND   AMERICA, I WANT TO ASK THEM --   HOW HIGH DOES THE WALL HAVE TO   BE TO KEEP THE INTERNET OUT?  AND WE ALSO HAVE TO TACKLE A   THORNY CHALLENGE THAT IS TOP OF   MIND HERE IN THE BAY AREA. NAVIGATING THE SECURITY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES' CONCERNS SURROUNDING THE ENCRYPTION OF   MOBILE DEVICES AND COMMUNICATIONS. IMPENETRATEABLE ENCRYPTION PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT CYBERSECURITY ADVANTAGES BUT   MAY ALSO MAKE IT HARDER FOR LAW   ENFORCEMENT AND COUNTERTERRORISM PROFESSIONALS   TO INVESTIGATE PLOTS AND   PREVENT FUTURE ATTACKS. ISIS KNOWS THIS TOO.  AT THE SAME TIME, THERE ARE LEGITIMATE WORRIES ABOUT PRIVACY, NETWORK SECURITY AND   CREATING NEW VULNERABILITIES THAT BAD ACTORS, INCLUDING TERRORISTS, CAN EXPLOIT. THERE MAY BE NO QUICK OR MAGIC FIX.  IN THE APP I WILL CASE, THE   F.B.I. MAY -- APP CASE, THE   F.B.I. MAY HAVE FOUND A WORK-AROUND.  THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT BE CHALLENGES.   SO THE TECH COMMUNITY AND THE   FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TO STOP   SEEING EACH OTHER AS ADVERSARIES AND WORK TOGETHER TO PROTECT OUR SAFETY AND OUR   PRIVACY. A NATIONAL COMMISSION ON   ENCRYPTION, LIKE SENATOR MARK WARNER AND CONGRESSMAN MIKE   MCCAUL ARE PROPOSING COULD HELP.   AND OUR SECURITY PROFESSIONALS COULD USE THE ADVICE AND   TALENTS OF TECHNOLOGY   PROFESSIONALS TO HELP US FIGURE   OUT HOW WE DO STAY AHEAD OF THE TERRORISTS.   OUR FIGHT AGAINST RADICAL JIHADIST TERRORISTS WILL BE LONG, AND THERE IS VERY REAL   RISK OF FUTURE ATTACKS HERE AT   HOME. BUT PURSUING THIS COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY WILL PUT US IN THE   BEST POSITION TO DEFEAT ISIS   AND KEEP OUR FAMILIES AND   COMMUNITIES SAFE. YOU KNOW, THIS IS A VERY PERSONAL ISSUE FOR ME.  HAVING SERVED AS A SENATOR FROM   NEW YORK ON 9/11, HAVING SEEN THE HORRORS THAT WERE PRODUCED BY A WELL-PLANNED AND EXECUTED ATTACK ON OUR COUNTRY, KNOWING HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE DO   STAY AHEAD OF THOSE WHO WISH TO DO US GREAT HARM WITHOUT PANIC, WITHOUT PARANOIA BUT WITH   RESOLVE, NOT TO GIVE IN TO THE VERY BEHAVIORS THAT THE   TERRORISTS ARE HOPING TO   ENGENDER. WE CAN'T LET FEAR STOP US FROM   DOING WHAT'S NECESSARY TO KEEP US SAFE, NOR CAN WE LET IT PUSH US INTO RECKLESS ACTIONS THAT   END UP MAKING US LESS SAFE.   FOR EXAMPLE, IT WOULD BE A SERIOUS MISTAKE TO STUMBLE INTO   ANOTHER COSTLY GROUND WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST. IF WE'VE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM   YIRKE AND AFGHANISTAN IT'S THAT PEOPLE -- IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, IT'S THAT PEOPLE AND NATIONS HAVE TO SECURE THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES.  WE CAN AND I ARGUE MUST SUPPORT THEM, BUT WE CAN'T SUBSTITUTE FOR THEM. IT WOULD ALSO BE A SERIOUS MISTAKE TO BEGIN CARPET BOMBING POPULATED AREAS INTO OBLIVION.  PROPOSING THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU   SOUND TOUGH.  IT MAKES YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'RE   IN OVER YOUR HEAD.  SLOGANS AREN'T A STRATEGY. LOOSE CANNONS TEND TO MISFIRE.  WHAT AMERICA NEEDS IS STRONG,   SMART, STEADY LEADERSHIP TO   WAGE AND WIN THIS STRUGGLE.   TO DO THAT WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN AMERICA'S ALLIANCES   IN EUROPE, ASIA AND AROUND THE WORLD, AND THAT IS THE SECOND   POINT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE. ON 9/11, NATO TREATED AN ATTACK   AGAINST ONE AS AN ATTACK AGAINST ALL.  ON SEPTEMBER 12, HEADLINES   ACROSS EUROPE, MOST NOTABLY IN LIMON, PROCLAIMED WE ARE ALL   AMERICANS. THERE WERE VERY FEW PLANES IN   THE AIR THAT DAY BUT ONE WAS A   BRITISH JET CARRYING THE U.K.'S   TOP NATIONAL SECURITY LEADERS   TO WASHINGTON TO OFFER ANY HELP THEY COULD.   NOW IT'S OUR TURN TO STAND WITH EUROPE.   WE CHERISH THE SAME VALUES AND FACE THE SAME ADVERSARIES, SO WE MUST SHARE THE SAME DETERMINATION.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE AT A   TIME WHEN EUROPE FACES MULTIPLE   OVERLAPPING CRISES.   FROM PRESIDENT PUTIN'S AGGRESSION IN UKRAINE TO THE   MASSIVE INFLUX OF REFUGEES TO   CONTINUING ECONOMIC CHALLENGES   TO THE RISE OF RIGHT-WING NATIONALIST PARTIES. WE HAVE MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS TOGETHER TOWARD THE GOAL OF A   EUROPE THAT IS FREE, WHOLE AND AT PEACE, AND WE CAN'T RISK LETTING IT FALL APART NOW. FOR DECADES, REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE   UNDERSTOOD THAT AMERICA'S ALLIANCES MAKE US STRONGER. SECRETARY SCHULTZ COMPARED THE SLOW, STEADY WORK OF BUILDING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONSHIPS TO GARDENING.  HE KNEW THAT WHEN YOU CULTIVATE EFFECTIVE PARTNERS YOU CAN HARVEST REAL REWARDS. ALLIES EXTEND OUR REACH, SHARING INTELLIGENCE, PROVIDE TROOPS IN CONFLICTS LIKE AFGHANISTAN, OFFER BASES AND   STAGING AREAS AROUND THE WORLD FOR OUR MILITARY AND SERVE AS A PARTNER AGAINST COMPETITORS LIKE RUSSIA AND CHINA.  AND BY THE WAY, BOTH MOSCOW AND   BEIJING KNOW OUR GLOBAL NETWORK OF ALLIANCES IS A SIGNIFICANT STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE THEY CAN'T   MATCH. NATO, IN PARTICULAR, IS ONE OF   THE BEST INVESTMENTS AMERICA   HAS EVER MADE, FROM THE BALKANS TO AFGHANISTAN AND BEYOND, NATO   ALLIES HAVE FOUGHT ALONGSIDE   THE UNITED STATES, SHARING THE   BURDENS AND THE SACRIFICES.   IN THE 1990'S, SECRETARY PERRY HELPED GUIDE NATO'S EXPANSION   BASED ON THE ALLIANCE'S CORE   TENANTS OF COLLECTIVE DEFENSE,   DEMOCRACY, CONSENSUS AND COOPERATIVE SECURITY. THEY BECAME KNOWN AS THE PERRY   PRINCIPLES, AND THEY'RE STILL AT THE HEART OF WHAT MAKES NATO   THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ALLIANCE IN   HISTORY. TURNING OUR BACK ON OUR   ALLIANCES OR TURNING OUR   ALLIANCE INTO A PROTECTION RACKET WOULD REVERSE DECADES OF BIPARTISAN AMERICAN LEADERSHIP   AND SEND A DANGEROUS SIGNAL TO   FRIEND AND FOE ALIKE.   PUTIN ALREADY HOPES TO DIVIDE EUROPE.   IF MR. TRUMP GETS HIS WAY, IT   WILL BE LIKE CHRISTMAS IN THE   KREMLIN.  IT WILL MAKE AMERICA LESS SAFE   AND THE WORLD MORE DANGEROUS.   WHEN IT COMES TO THE STRUGGLE AGAINST ISIS, WE NEED OUR ALLIES AS MUCH AS EVER. WE NEED THEM TO BE STRONG AND ENGAGED FOR THEY ARE INCREASINGLY ON THE FRONT LINES. LONDON, PARIS, MADRID, BRUSSELS, ISTANBUL, THEY'VE ALL   BEEN HIT BY TERRORISM.  AND AS WE SAW WHEN A TERRORIST   CELL IN HAMBURG CARRIED OUT THE 9/11 ATTACKS, WHAT HAPPENS IN   EUROPE HAS A WAY OF MAKING IT   TO AMERICA.   SO IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE HAVE   STRONG PARTNERS WHO CAN WORK   WITH US TO DISRUPT PLOTS AND   DISMANTLE NETWORKS IN THEIR OWN   COUNTRIES BEFORE THEY LEAD TO   ATTACKS IN OURS. AMERICA NEEDS EUROPEAN   INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WORKING   HAND IN HAND WITH OUR OWN,   INCLUDING WHERE THEY MAY HAVE   BETTER REACH AND EXPERTISE,   LIKE IN NORTH AFRICA.   WE NEED EUROPEAN BANKS TO STOP   TERRORIST FINANCING.  WE NEED EUROPEAN PLANES FLYING MISSIONS OVER IRAQ AND SYRIA,   AND EUROPEAN SPECIAL FORCES HELPING TRAIN AND EQUIP LOCAL ANTI-ISIS FORCES ON THE GROUND. WE NEED EUROPEAN DIPLOMATS AND   DEVELOPMENT EXPERTS WORKING TO   IMPROVE GOVERNANCE AND REDUCE   THE APPEAL OF EXTREMISM ACROSS THE WIDE ARC OF INSTABILITY THAT STRETCHES FROM WEST AFRICA ALL THE WAY TO ASIA.  TOGETHER WE CAN DO MORE AND MORE URGENTLY TO SUPPORT MODERATE VOICES AND STAND WITH TUNISIANS, LIBYANS, KURDS AND OTHERS IN THE REGION WHO ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. AND AS WE SHOULD, OF COURSE, BE CLOSELY CONSULTING WITH ISRAEL,   OUR STRONGEST ALLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WE ALSO HAVE TO EXTEND OUR CONSULTATION TO ARAB PARTNERS AS WELL.   ALL OF THIS WILL MAKE AMERICA   SAFER AND HELP DEFEAT ISIS. THERE'S MUCH WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT OUR EUROPEAN PARTNERS, HELPING THEM IMPROVE INTELLIGENCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT, FACILITATING IN INFORMATION SHARING, WORKING MORE CLOSELY AT EVERY LEVEL. THERE'S ALSO MORE THEY CAN DO   TO SHARE THE BURDEN WITH US.  WE'D LIKE TO SEE MORE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES INVESTING IN DEFENSE   AND SECURITY, FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE GERMANY AND OTHERS HAVE   SET DURING THE OBAMA   ADMINISTRATION. THE MOST URGENT TASK IS STOPPING THE FLOW OF FOREIGN FIGHTERS TO AND FROM THE MIDDLE   EAST. THOUSANDS OF YOUNG RECRUITS   HAVE FLOCKED TO SYRIA FROM FRANCE, GERMANY, BELGIUM AND   THE UNITED KINGDOM. THEIR EUROPEAN PASSPORTS MAKE   IT EASIER FOR THEM TO CROSS BORDERS AND EVENTUALLY RETURN HOME. RADICALIZED AND   BATTLE-HARDENED. WE NEED TO KNOW THE IDENTITIES   OF EVERY FIGHTER WHO MAKES THAT   TRIP AND START REVOKING PASSPORTS AND VISAS.  STEMMING THIS TIDE WILL REQUIRE MUCH BETTER COORDINATION AMONG   EVERY COUNTRY ALONG THE WAY. RIGHT NOW, MANY EUROPEAN NATIONS MANY COUNTRIES DON'T ALERT EACH OTHER WHEN THEY TURN AWAY A SUSPECTED JIHADDIST AT THE   BORDER OR WHEN A PASSPORT IS STOLEN.   TURKEY A NATO ALLY, STILL HAS WORK TO DO TO CONTROL THE BORDER  WHERE MOST FOREIGN FIGHTERS CROSS INTO SYRIA. AFTER THE PARIS ATTACKS, FRANCE   AND BELGIUM PLEDGED TO MOVE FORWARD BUT THAT'S DIFFICULT WITHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION.   IN JANUARY, THE E.U. ANNOUNCED A NEW INTEGRATED COUNTERTERRORISM CENTER BUT INTELLIGENCE COOPERATION STILL LAGS. AND THE E.U. KEEPS DELAYING A   VOTE TO SHARE TRAVELER   INFORMATION BETWEEN MEMBER STATES. IT'S ACTUALLY EASIER FOR THE UNITED STATES TO GET FLIGHT MANIFESTS FROM E.U. NATIONS THAN  IT IS FOR E.U. NATIONS TO GET   THEM FROM THEIR OWN NEIGHBORS.  THANKS TO AN AGREEMENT THAT THE   UNITED STATES NEGOTIATED WHEN I   WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.   THERE ALSO HAS TO BE A SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON IDENTIFYING AND   INVESTING IN THE HOT SPOTS, THE SPECIFIC NEIGHBORHOODS, PRISONS,  AND SCHOOLS WHERE RECRUITMENT   HAPPENS IN CLUSTERS AS WE'VE   SEEN IN BRUSSELS. AND IT'S TIME TO MAKE GOOD ON   THE PROMISE OF ESTABLISHING A   NEW UNIFIED EUROPEAN BORDER AND   COAST GUARD, TO STRENGTHEN THE   CONTINENT'S EXTERNAL BORDERS WHICH ARE UNDER UNPRECEDENTED   PRESSURE FROM REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS.   NOW THIS IS A HEARTBREAKING CRISIS. LAST YEAR, THE WORLD WAS   HORRIFIED BY THE PHOTO OF A DROWNED TODDLER LYING ON A   TURKISH BEACH. IN THE MONTHS SINCE THEN,   HUNDREDS MORE CHILDREN HAVE DIED  TRYING TO REACH SAFETY. WE'VE SEEN EUROPE AND SYRIA'S   NEIGHBORS IN THE MIDDLE EAST   STRUGGLE UNDER THE WEIGHT OF   THIS CHALLENGE. IT'S TOO BIG FOR ANY ONE COUNTRY  OR EVEN CONTINENT TO HANDLE ALONE.  I'M GLAD THAT THE E.U. AND   TURKEY ARE NOW WORKING CLOSELY   TOGETHER AND THE UNITED STATES SHOULD DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO   SUPPORT THAT.   THE ONLY TRULY EFFECTIVE ANSWER   IS TO GO TO THE SOURCE, END THE   CONFLICT THAT'S DISPLACING ALL   THESE PEOPLE.   SO WE HAVE TO SUPPORT AND   MAINTAIN THE CEASE FIRE IN SYRIA  AND WE SHOULD WORK WITH OUR   COALITION PARTNERS AND OPPOSITION FORCES ON THE GROUND TO CREATE SAFE AREAS WHERE SYRIANS CAN REMAIN IN THE   COUNTRY RATHER THAN FLEEING TOWARD EUROPE. IN THE MEANTIME, IT WOULD BE   WRONG TO SHUT OUR DOORS TO ORPHANS OR TO APPLY RELIGIOUS TESTS TO PEOPLE FLEEING PERSECUTION.  THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE.  BUT OF COURSE WE HAVE TO BE   VIGILANT IN SCREENING AND   VETTING EVERYONE.   WE CAN'T ALLOW TERRORISTS TO INTIMIDATE US INTO ABANDONING OUR VALUES AND HUMANITARIAN OBLIGATIONS, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO BE SMART AND VIGILANT ABOUT HOW WE PROCESS PEOPLE INTO OUR COUNTRY. IT WOULD BE DOUBLY CRUEL IF ISIS  COULD NOT ONLY FORCE FAMILIES   FROM THEIR HOMES BUT ALSO   PREVENT THEM FROM EVER FINDING   NEW ONES. AND THAT BRINGS ME TO MY THIRD POINT.  IN OUR FIGHT AGAINST RADICAL JIHADISM, WE HAVE TO DO WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS.   ONE THING WE KNOW THAT DOES NOT WORK IS OFFENSIVE INFLAMMATORY   RHETORIC THAT DEMONIZES ALL   MUSLIMS.  THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEACE-LOVING MUSLIMS LIVING,   WORKING, RAISING FAMILIES AND PAYING TAXES IN THIS COUNTRY. THESE AMERICANS ARE A CRUCIAL   LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST TERRORISM.  THEY ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO   RECOGNIZE THE WARNING SIGNS OF   RADICALIZATION BEFORE IT'S TOO   LATE AND THE BEST POSITIONED TO   BLOCK IT.   LAST YEAR IN MINNEAPOLIS, I MET PARENTS, TEACHERS, IMAMS AND OTHERS IN THE SOMALY-AMERICAN COMMUNITY WHO ARE WORKING WITH  -- SOMALI AMERICAN COMMUNITY WHO  ARE WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT  PROFESSIONALS AND OTHERS TO   INTERVENE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AT   RISK OF BEING RADICALIZED. EFFORTS LIKE THAT DESERVE MORE   LOCAL AND NATIONAL SUPPORT. SINCE 9/11, LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS WORKED HARD TO BUILD TRUSTFUL AND STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH   AMERICAN MUSLIM COMMUNITIES.  AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE F.B.I. TOLD CONGRESS, ANYTHING THAT   ERODES THAT TRUST MAKES THEIR   JOB MORE DIFFICULT.   WE NEED EVERY AMERICAN COMMUNITY INVESTED IN THIS FIGHT, NOT   FEARFUL AND SITTING ON THE SIDELINES.  SO WHEN REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES LIKE TED CRUZ CALL FOR TREATING AMERICAN MUSLIMS LIKE CRIMINALS, AND FOR RACIALLY PROFILING PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM   NEIGHBORHOODS, IT'S WRONG, IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, IT'S DANGEROUS. AS A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NEW YORK   POLICE DEPARTMENT POINTED OUT LAST NIGHT, THAT KIND OF BLANKET BIG TRIWOULD TREAT THE CITY'S -- BIGOTRY WOULD TREAT THE CITY'S NEARLY 1,000 MUSLIM POLICE   OFFICERS AS THREATS.  IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE A MORE INCENDIARY, FOOLISH STATEMENT,   HE SAID. COMMISSIONER BILL BRATTON OF THE NYPD WAS EVEN MORE BLUNT THIS MORNING. HE SAID, SENATOR CRUZ DOESN'T   KNOW WHAT THE HELL HE'S TALKING ABOUT.  DEMONIZING MUSLIMS ALSO   ALIENATES PARTNERS AND MODERATES  WE NEED AROUND THE WORLD IN THE   FIGHT AGAINST ISIS.   THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK FROM   BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ABOUT BUILDING COALITIONS WITH   MUSLIM NATIONS.   HAVING ACTUALLY DONE THIS, I CAN TELL YOU, INSUMMITTING ALLIES AND PARTNERS IS NOT A GOOD WAY   TO START. ANOTHER THING WE KNOW THAT DOES   NOT WORK BASED ON LOTS OF EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS TORTURE. MANY INTELLIGENCE, MILITARY AND   LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERTS HAVE   ATTESTED TO THIS FACT.  IT ALSO PUTS OUR OWN TROOPS AND   INCREASINGLY OUR OWN CIVILIANS   AT GREATER RISK. I'M PROUD TO HAVE BEEN PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION THAT BANNED   TORTURE AFTER TOO MANY YEARS IN   WHICH WE HAD LOST OUR WAY. IF I'M PRESIDENT, THE UNITED   STATES WILL NOT CONDONE OR   PRACTICE TORTURE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.  EVEN WHEN WE'RE UP AGAINST OPPONENTS WHO DON'T RESPECT   HUMAN LIFE OR HUMAN RIGHTS, TORTURE IS NOT THE RIGHT CHOICE. AS SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN HAS SAID, THE HIGH STANDARD TO WHICH WE   HOLD OURSELVES ISN'T ABOUT OUR ENEMIES.  IT'S ABOUT US. IT'S ABOUT WHO WE WERE, WHO WE ARE, AND WHO WE ASPIRE TO BE. AMERICA IS A GREAT NATION. AND THIS IS TIME FOR AMERICAN LEADERSHIP.   SMART, STRONG, STEADY   LEADERSHIP. NO OTHER COUNTRY CAN RALLY   ALLIES AND PARTNERS TO DEFEAT   ISIS AND WIN THE GENERATIONAL STRUGGLE AGAINST RADICAL JIHADDIST TERRORISM. ONLY THE UNITED STATES CAN MOBILIZE COMMON ACTION ON A GLOBAL SCALE.   IN DEFENSE OF OUR PEOPLE AND OUR VALUES. AMERICA DOESN'T COWER IN FEAR OR HIDE BEHIND WALLS. WE LEAD AND WE SUCCEED. THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY, WE HAVE STARED INTO THE FACE OF EVIL AND  REFUSED TO BLINK. WHETHER IT WAS FASCISM, THE COLD  WAR, OR HUNTING DOWN OSAMA BIN LADEN.  AND WE WILL DEFEAT ISIS TOO.  NO ENEMY OR ADVERSARY SHOULD EVER UNDERESTIMATE THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN   PEOPLE. I WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT IT WAS   LIKE TO ARRIVE IN BRUSSELS FOR   THE FIRST TIME AS SECRETARY OF   STATE IN MARCH OF 2009.   I WAS ON MY WAY TO NATO. NATO HEADQUARTERS WAS BUZZING.  HUNDREDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT HAD STOOD AND CHEERED, NOT FOR ME, BUT FOR  THE IDEA OF AMERICAN LEADERSHIP,  FOR THE PROMISE OF AN ALLIANCE THAT DELIVERED UNPRECEDENTED PEACE AND PROSPERITY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC.  THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER TODAY.  AMERICANS CANNOT AND I BELIEVE   WILL NOT TURN ON EACH OTHER, TURN ON OUR ALLIES, OR TURN AWAY  FROM OUR PRINCIPLES.  WE'RE IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL   AND THAT MEANS WE'RE GOING TO   WORK TOGETHER AND WE'RE GOING TO PREVAIL.  THIS MAY BE ANOTHER ONE OF THE LONG STRUGGLES THAT WE HAVE CONFRONTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR HISTORY, BUT LIKE ALL THE   REST OF THOSE, WE CAN FORGE A   BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS, IF WE CAN   BRING OUR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND   WHAT THIS STRUGGLE MEANS TO US,   IF WE CAN MAINTAIN OUR ALLIANCES AND OUR PARTNERSHIPS, WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. AND THAT WILL BENEFIT NOT ONLY OUR COUNTRY BUT THE WORLD AND THAT, WHEN YOU BOIL IT DOWN IS WHAT AMERICAN LEADERSHIP HAS TO   BE ABOUT. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

I AM EXCITED TO BE IN SEATTLE  AND I WANT TO THANK MAYOR MURRAY  FOR HIS ENTERS MEANT. I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING A GOOD  PARTNER WITH YOU ON BEHALF OF  THIS GREAT AMERICAN CITY AND I  WILL TAKE YOU UP ON THE OFFER TO  HAVE MICHAEL TALK TO MY HUSBAND.   I WANT TO THANK  ATTORNEY GENERAL BOB FERGUSON,  THE COUNTY EXECUTIVE, STATE  SENATOR KEVIN RANKER, I WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENT OF THE  AMERICAN NURSES ASSOCIATION. AND THE PRESIDENT OF WASHING STATE NURSES ASSOCIATION FOR ENDORSING ME TODAY. I AM SO PROUD TO BE ENDORSED BY  THE NURSES OF AMERICA.   AND I WANT TO  THANK ALL OF THE ELECTED  OFFICIALS WHO ARE HERE WITH US  AND I PARTICULARLY WANT TO PAY  TRIBUTE TO THIS GREAT HIGH  SCHOOL. A GREAT, GREAT HIGH SCHOOL. YOU KNOW, RAINIER BEACH IS NOT  ONLY THE CHAMPION OF ASCOT FALL -- BASKET ALL, IT IS THE  CHAMPION OF THE INTERNATIONAL BACHELORETTE -- BACCALAUREATE AND THE GREAT STUDENTS HERE.  IT MAKES ME SO PROUD TO KNOW  WHAT THE SCHOOL'S COMPETITION AND I WILL TELL YOU IF I AM  FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE YOUR  PRESIDENT I WANT TO BE A PARTNER WITH PRINCIPALS AND TEACHERS AND STUDENTS AND FAMILIES LIKE THE ONES HERE AT THE BEACH. I AM ALSO VERY GREAT ROLE TO ALL OF OUR VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE  WORKING SO HARD IN THIS CAMPAIGN . ACROSS THIS GREAT STATE. YOU ARE KNOCKING DOWN BARRIERS, YOU ARE BUILDING LADDERS OF  OPPORTUNITY, YOU ARE HELPING US  MAKE THE POINT THAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT BOTH THE GROWING AND SHARING THE PROMISE OF AMERICA. WE ARE DETERMINED. WE ARE DETERMINED THAT WE ARE  GOING TO GIVE UP BACK THE HOPE THAT TO EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD HAVE THAT TO THEIR HARD WORK  WILL GET THEM AHEAD. WILL ENABLE THEM TO HAVE A BETTER FUTURE. WE'LL GIVE THEIR CHILDREN, AND  YES, THEIR GRANDCHILDREN, THEIR  CHANCE TO GIVE -- LIVE UP TO THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL.  THAT IS WHAT WE WANT FOR AMERICA  AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING  TOGETHER IN THIS CAMPAIGN. YOU ARE ALL PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOUR SELVES. YOU ARE PART OF THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTION WE HAVE HAD FOR A LONG TIME IN AMERICA.  I KNOW THAT THE STATE'S HIGHER  BY THE DAY. I AM SORRY THAT TO ALL THE  PEOPLE OUTSIDE COULD NOT BE IT  INTO THIS GYMNASIUM. BUT I SAW THE EXCITEMENT THAT  THEY HAD WHILE STANDING IN LINE.  SOME OF THEM WITH THEIR  CHILDREN. AND I WANT THEM TO KNOW IF WE CAN GET THE WORD OUT TO THEM THAT I'M GRATEFUL THAT THEY  CAME, I AM SORRY THEY COULD NOT  IN AN. BUT THEY, TOO, UNDERSTAND WHAT IS AT STAKE. I AM VERY PROUD TO HAVE WON  ARIZONA TONIGHT. [CHEERS AND  IT IS EXCITING TO  SEE THAT COME IN. BECAUSE ARIZONA, LIKE A LOT OF OTHERS, IS GOING TO BE EXPRESSING THEMSELVES THROUGH  THEIR VOTES. UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT JUST  A CONTEST BETWEEN DIFFERENT  CANDIDATES. THIS IS A CONTEST BETWEEN  FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT VIEWS OF OUR COUNTRY, OUR VALUES, AND OUR  FUTURE. WHAT WE SAW HAPPEN TODAY IN  BRUSSELS, THE HORRIBLE TERRORIST ATTACK, REMINDS US OF HOW HIGH THE STAKES ARE.  WE LIVE IN A COMPLEX AND DANGEROUS WORLD. AND WE NEED A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF THAT IS STRONG, SMART, AND ABOVE ALL, STEADY IN TAKING ON THESE THREATS.   THE LAST THING  WE NEED, MY FRIENDS, TO INCITE -- OUR LEADERS WHO INCITE MORE  FEAR. IN THE FACE OF TERROR, AMERICA  DOES NOT PANIC. WE DO NOT BUILD WALLS OR TURN  OUR BACKS ON OUR ALLIES. WE CANNOT THROW OUT EVERYTHING  WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT WORKS AND  WHAT DOES NOT AND START  TORTURING PEOPLE.  WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS SUGGESTING  IS NOT ONLY WRONG, IT IS DANGEROUS. IT WILL NOT TO KEEP US SAFE. THIS IS A TIME FOR AMERICA TO LEAD, NOT COWER. AND WE WILL LEAD.  AND WE WILL DEFEAT TERRORISTIC  THREATS. AND WE WILL NOT THREATEN OUR  FRIENDS AND ALLIES. WE WILL TAKE THE FIGHT TO ISIS  FROM THE AIR. ON THE GROUND WITH LOCAL FORCES. AND ONLINE WHERE THEY RECRUIT AND PROPAGANDIZE. WE HAVE TO DO STOP THE GLOBAL TERROR PIPELINE. STOP THE FLOW OF FIGHTERS, WEAPONS, AND MONEYS. AND WE HAVE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR ALLIES BECAUSE THAT  COOPERATION WILL HELP MAKE OUR OWN COUNTRY SAFE. THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT. AND THAT IS YET ANOTHER REASON WHY THIS ELECTION REALLY MATTERS.  YOUR HARD WORK, YOUR COMMITMENT, YOUR OPTIMISM ABOUT WHAT WE CAN  DO TOGETHER, IT'S WHAT I AM COUNTING ON.  WE NEED TO KEEP WORKING TOGETHER, WE NEED TO MAKE A  POINT THAT WE ARE GOING INTO THE FUTURE WITH CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM. THERE IS A LOT OF PESSIMISTIC TALK, AND NEGATIVITY. IT IS AS THOUGH WE, AS AMERICANS, NOBODY CAN BEAT US UP WE'RE UP TO THE GAME.  IF WE GO AFTER WHAT MATTERS TO  OURSELVES, AND OUR COUNTRY.   THAT IS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE JOINED THIS CAMPAIGN. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE NEXT PRESIDENT, WHOEVER IT IS WALKING INTO THE WHITE HOUSE.    WELL --   WELL, I BELIEVE -- I DO BELIEVE I'M THE MOST READY  OF EVERYBODY RUNNING.   I WANT YOU TO  THINK ABOUT THIS.  I KNOW THAT THE CAUCUS ON  SATURDAY HERE IN WASHINGTON IS  AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE ON THIS  PATH TO THE NOMINATION, AND THE ELECTION.  I AM WELL AWARE THAT WE HAVE TO  WORK HARD BETWEEN NOW AND  SATURDAY TO CONVINCE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON.  AND I WANT YOU TO ASK THEM WITH ME, WHAT THEY ANSWER HER TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT'S THREE BIG TEST. INC. AS THIS WILL BE TRUE WHOEVER IT IS. -- BECAUSE THIS WILL BE TRUE  WHOEVER IT IS. NUMBER ONE, CAN YOU MAKE A  POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES  OF AMERICANS? NUMBER TWO CAN YOU KEEP US SAFE? NUMBER THREE, CAN YOU BRING US  TOGETHER INSTEAD OF DRIVING US APART?   I HAVE GIVEN A  LOT OF THOUGHT TO THESE TESTS,  BECAUSE I KNOW, HAVING TRAVELED ACROSS OUR COUNTRY THAT EACH ONE OF THEM REALLY MATTERS TO AMERICANS.  START WITH THE FIRST, CAN YOU  MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE? YOU KNOW, A LOT OF FOLKS ASK ME, WHY ARE SO MANY OF THESE PEOPLE  WHO GO TO THESE OF RALLIES SO  ANGRY. WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED, WORRIED FOLLOW -- WORRIED. A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEIR  BEST DAYS, AND IT THEREFORE OUR  COUNTRY'S BEST DAYS, ARE BEHIND  THEM. THINK BACK, WE HAVE THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION.  9 MILLION AMERICANS LOST THEIR JOBS.  5 MILLION HOMES WERE LOST. $13 TRILLION IN FAMILY WEALTH WAS WIPED OUT. A LOT OF AMERICANS HAVEN'T RECOVERED FROM THAT. A LOT OF AMERICANS HAVEN'T HAD A  RAISE IN 15 YEARS. A LOT OF AMERICANS WORRY THAT LIFE IS NOT GOING TO BE BETTER FOR THEIR KIDS. I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT. BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN ALL WE  SEE IS THE UGLINESS OF THESE PROTESTS, THE MEAN-SPIRITEDNESS,  WE SEE PEOPLE RUNNING TO BE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  WHO ARE LITERALLY INCITING  BIGOTRY AND VIOLENCE.  IT IS EASY TO SAY -- I WILL NOT  EVEN PAY ATTENTION TO THAT. BUT WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW IS,  BUT WE HAVE GOT TO RECLAIM THE  PROMISE OF AMERICA FOR ALL OF  OUR PEOPLE.  EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.   TO ME, THAT  STARTS WITH MORE GOOD JOBS WITH  RISING INCOME.  IT INCLUDES STANDING UP FOR  UNIONS, AND THE AMERICAN LABOR MOVEMENT.   IT MEANS MORE  INFRASTRUCTURE JOBS BECAUSE IT  IS NOT JUST WHAT YOU SEE, THE  ROADS, BRIDGES, TUNNELS, IT IS  WHAT YOU DON'T SEE.  IT IS THE DETERIORATING WATER  SYSTEMS ACROSS AMERICA.  IT IS THE LEAKING PIPELINES  ACROSS AMERICA.  IT IS WHAT WE SAW IN FLINT, MICHIGAN.  AS HORRIBLE AS THAT IS, I WISH I  COULD TELL YOU IT IS THE ONLY PLACE.  BUT IT IS NOT.  CHILDREN, 500,000 A YEAR ARE AFFECTED BY LEAD POISONING. WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO.  IT IS IMPORTANT WORK. IT WILL PUT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO WORK.  YOU CAN'T EXPORT THOSE JOBS,  THEY HAVE TO BE DONE RIGHT HERE  IN SEATTLE, IN WASHINGTON, AND  ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.   WE NEED MORE MANUFACTURING JOBS. THERE ARE SOME WHO SAY WE CAN'T MAKE THINGS IN AMERICA. I WAS OUT AT EVERETT TODAY. I MET WITH THE MACHINISTS, AND  THE AEROSPACE WORKERS.   YES, WE CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE CAN.  RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA.  BUT WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE  THAT WE CHANGE THE INCENTIVES IN  OUR TAX CODE, WHICH UNFORTUNATELY ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO MOVE JOBS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY.  WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT ON, AND  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ADVANCED MANUFACTURING,  AND THE GOOD JOBS THAT COME WITH IT.  WE ARE GOING TO START BY MAKING  SURE THE MACHINISTS AND  AEROSPACE WORKERS OFFICER MAKING THE BEST PLANES, AND DOING THE  MOST ADVANCED WORK OF ANYBODY IN  THE WORLD.   WE'RE GOING TO  COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE WITH MORE CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY JOBS.   THIS IS ONE OF  THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL IDEAS  FACING US THIS ELECTION.  I AM PROUD THAT AS A SECRETARY OF STATE, I BEGAN THE WORK WITH  PRESIDENT OBAMA AND OUR TEAM  THAT LED TO THE PARIS AGREEMENT. THAT MADE AS POSSIBLE -- THAT  MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO SAY  THIS HAS TO BE A TOP LEVEL  PRIORITY. BUT IF WE DO NOT FULFILL IT, IT MEANS NOTHING. IT IS JUST A PIECE OF PAPER SIGNED BY 190 NATIONS. I AM PROUD OF THE WORK PRESIDENT OBAMA DID AGAINST IMPLACABLE HOSTILITY FROM THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS.   I WILL BUILD, UPLIFT, AND PROTECT THAT WORK. I SET SOME BIG GOALS, I WANT  HALF A MILLION MORE SOLAR PANELS  BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM.   I WANT ENOUGH  CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY TO POWER  EVERY HOME IN AMERICA BY THE END  OF MY SECOND TERM.   WE KNOW HOW TO TAKE ON BIG CHALLENGES IN OUR COUNTRY. IT IS TIME WE START ACTING LIKE IT AGAIN.  I AM TIRED OF THE DENIAL, THE  DECEPTION, AND THE KOCH BROTHERS  MANIPULATION OF OUR POLITICAL  PROCESS.   AS WE GROW OUR  ECONOMY, LET'S DO MORE FOR SMALL  BUSINESSES, PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT TO START SMALL BUSINESSES.   I WANT TO THANK  YOUR MAYOR, AND EVERYBODY, FIGHTING TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE IN WASHINGTON.   WE NEED TO  RAISE IT ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL. IT IS JUST WRONG THAT ANYBODY WHO WORKS FULL TIME WOULD STILL  BE MIRED IN POVERTY. AND YOU KNOW, IT TWO-THIRDS OF  ALL MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS ARE  WOMEN. LET US FINALLY GUARANTEE EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN'S WORK. SO I AM TELLING YOU WHAT I AM  GOING TO DO. I AM LAYING IT OUT AND WE ARE GOING TO DO IT TOGETHER. THAT ALSO GOES FOR EDUCATION. EVERY CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY  DESERVES A GOOD SCHOOL AND A GOOD TEACHER REGARDLESS OF THE  ZIP CODE THAT CHILD LIVES IN. AS THE MAYOR SAID, I WANT MORE  EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. I WANT TO BE A PARTNER WITH TODAY'S TEACHERS. I WANT THEM TO KNOW THE PRESIDENT WILL BE ON THEIR SIDE  AS YOU DO THE WORK TO GATHER TO  GET THE KIDS THE EDUCATION AND SKILLS THEY NEED.   I AM ALSO GOING  TO LAUNCH A CAMPAIGN WITH YOUR  HELP, THE HELP OF OUR  CONSTRUCTION AND TRADE UNIONS,  AND OTHERS, TO ENHANCE MORE  APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS TO  ENCOURAGE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE TO  GO AND SEEK THE SKILLS THEY NEED  TO BE ABLE TO BE EMPLOYED.  WE HAVE MADE A GRAVE ERROR IN  ANY WAY UNDERMINING THE WORK  THAT IS DONE BY CARPENTERS, AND PLUMBERS, AND MACHINISTS, AND ELECTRICIANS, AND WELDERS. THIS IS WORK THAT IS IN DEMAND  ACROSS OUR COUNTRY.  WE ARE GOING TO NEED MORE THAN  ONE MILLION PEOPLE RIGHT NOW TO  FILL THESE JOBS. I WANT ASKED TO START DOING THIS  AGAIN AND HIGH SCHOOLS,  COMMUNITY COLLEGES, AND  APPRENTICE PROGRAMS.  WHICH IS WHY I WANT TO MAKE A  COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE, SO THAT  TO A YOUNG PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO  YET THOSE SKILLS. AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO MAKE  FOUR-YEAR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES DEBT-FREE TUITION  SO THAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO  ATTEND. [CHEERS  I DO DIFFER  WITH MY ESTEEMED OPPONENT WHO  SAYS FREE FOR EVERYBODY.  I WANT TO CONCENTRATE ON  MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES, WORKING  FAMILIES, FOR FAMILIES -- POOR FAMILIES. PERSONALLY, I THINK IF YOU CAN  AFFORD TO SEND IT YOUR CHILD TO  COLLEGE, LIKE DONALD TRUMP, WE SHOULD NOT PAY TO SEND YOUR  CHILD FOR FREE. AND THEN, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE ON THE PROBLEM OF STUDENT DEBT WHICH IS STALKING THE LIVES OF  MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. [CHEERS AND  THIS IS  PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST  PRESSING PROBLEMS THAT I  ENCOUNTER AS I TRAVEL AROUND. AND I ASKED THE CROWDS AS I TRAVEL AROUND, HOW MANY HAVE  STUDENT DEBT?  OK, A HUGE MAJORITY.  HUGE, HUGE MAJORITY. BUT OK I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS, , DOES ANYBODY HERE HAVE AN  INTEREST RATE HIGHER THAN 10%?  I MEAN, THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS. 8%?  HOW MANY HAVE EIGHT PERCENT?  HOW ABOUT MORE THAN 6%? WE HAVE NOT HAD INTEREST RATES  FOR MOST THINGS BESIDES A  STUDENT DEBT THAT TIME IN YEARS. YOU CAN REFINANCE YOUR MORTGAGE AND GET A BETTER DEAL.  YOU CAN FINANCIAL CAR TO DO A  BETTER DEAL, CORPORATIONS CAN  REFINANCE THEIR DEBT.  I AM GOING TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE  FOR YOU TO REFINANCE YOUR  STUDENT DEBT AND GET THAT  INTEREST RATE DOWN THE.   THEN  I WANT TO  AND THEN, I WANTHILLARY CLINTON:  THEN I WANT TO TO SWITCH AS MANY  OF YOU AS WILL GO INTO  CONTINGENCY REPAYMENT PROGRAMS.  YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?  WHEN I GRADUATED FROM LAW  SCHOOL, I DIDN'T HAVE ANY HELP  GOING TO SCHOOL, I HAD TO WORK  AND BORROW MONEY.  I CAME OUT WITH THE DEBT.  BUT MY HUSBAND AND I WERE IN A  CONTINGENCY REPAYMENT PROGRAM.  WE PAID IT BACK AS A PERCENTAGE  OF OUR INCOME. SO, I COULD GO TO WORK FOR THE  CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND RIGHT  OUT OF LAW SCHOOL, WHICH WAS A  JOB I WANTED TO DO.   AND I DON'T KNOW,  I THINK I MADE $14,000 A YEAR AND I COULD PAY MY DEBT BACK AS  A PERCENTAGE. I WANT EVERYONE OF YOU DO HAVE  THAT CHANCE.  FURTHERMORE, I WANT A DATE  CERTAIN WHEN YOUR OBLIGATION  WILL END.   WHEN I THINK  ABOUT HEALTH CARE, TELL YOU THIS. I AM PROUD TO THE NURSES AND DOORS MET BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, NURSES ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF EDUCATION.  THEY SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN SO  MANY DIFFERENT FAMILIES AND SETTINGS.  YOU KNOW, WHEN WE WERE IN THE HOSPITAL WITH MY DAUGHTER, WHEN  SHE HAD OUR GRANDDAUGHTER  CHARLOTTE. I WAS TALKING TO ONE OF THE NURSES, AND SHE SAID, YOU KNOW,  SO MANY OF THE MOTHERS IN HERE  DO NOT HAVE BEEN A TIME OFF. -- DO NOT HAVE ANY TIME OFF. THEY DON'T HAVE EARNED SICK  DAYS, DON'T HAVE PAID FAMILY  LEAVE, THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE  UNPAID LEAVE UNDER THE FAMILY  AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT THAT MY  HUSBAND SIGNED INTO LAW.  THAT MADE A BIG IMPRESSION ON  ME.  THE NURSES SEE EVERYTHING. WE WILL HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE, WE WILL HAVE EARNED SICK DAYS, --           WE'RE GOING TO  MAKE PROGRESS ON HEALTH CARE, WE  ARE GOING TO GET UNIVERSAL  HEALTH CARE COVERAGE.  WE ARE AT 90% AND WE ARE GOING  TO GET THERE. SO THERE IS A BIG AGENDA FOR US THAT I WANT YOU TO BE PART OF. SECONDLY, I WANT IS TO KEEP  OURSELVES SAFE. THAT IS SOMETHING I'M COMMITTED TO.  IT IS NOT ONLY ABOUT STOPPING  TERRORIST ATTACKS, ALTHOUGH  CLEARLY THAT HAS TO BE THE FRONT OF MIND. I WANT US TO HAVE THE KIND OF  SAFETY THAT INCLUDES ALL LEVELS, INTELLIGENCE COOPERATION, WORKING WITH OUR FRIENDS AND  OTHERS TO DEEP RIGHT -- TO  DEFEAT ISIS, TO GET UNDER THE  THREAT THAT TERRORISM POSES. HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO SAY.  DONALD TRUMP AND TED CRUZ --    HAVE MADE OUR JOBS  HARDER IN THE LAST FEW DAYS.  SAYING WE NEED TO GET OUT OF NATO. SAYING OTHER THINGS.  WE NEED TO MODERNIZE AND MAKE IT  TOUGHER THAN IT IS TODAY.  INCLUDING TERRORISM. THAT IS WHAT WE WILL DO.  TED CRUZ SAYING WE NEED TO POLICE EVERYWHERE MUSLIMS LIVE. I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT  THAT IS NOT ONLY OFFENSIVE, IT  IS DANGEROUS. IT IS WE WANT EVERYBODY TO FEEL  LIKE WE ARE TOGETHER ON OUR COMMON DEFENSE AGAINST TERRORISM.   SO REMEMBER WHEN  YOU GO TO CAUCUS AND YOUR  FRIENDS GO TO CAUCUS ON  SATURDAY, THIS IS ABOUT NOT ONLY  SELECTING A PRESIDENT BUT ALSO  SELECTING A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. AND WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE THOSE STEADY HANDS, BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO FACE A LOT OF  CHALLENGES BUT ALSO  OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE UNITED  STATES HAS A LEAD ON. AND FINALLY, THE THIRD TEST, CAN YOU BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER INSTEAD OF DIVIDING IT? WELL, I FEEL SO STRONGLY THAT THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES NOT JUST FOR  THE PRESIDENT BUT FOR ALL OF US. I READ AN INTERESTING ARTICLE THE OTHER DAY.  THE MAN WRITING AND SAID, WE NOW GET ALONG WITH PEOPLE DIFFERENT FROM US ON NEARLY EVERYTHING BUT  POLITICS. LOOK AT THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE ON CIVIL RIGHTS, WOMEN'S  RIGHTS, GAY RIGHTS. ON ALL OF THE TOUGH ISSUES. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICS,  WE DO NOT WANT TO TALK TO EACH OTHER. WE WANT TO DRAW A LINE. I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO SEEK AND  FIND COMMON GROUND WHEREVER POSSIBLE. I ALSO BELIEVE WE HAVE TO STAND OUR GROUND ON AN IMPORTANT MATTERS OF PRINCIPLE AND VALUES. BUT WE CANNOT LET OUR NATION BE  DIVIDED. WE CANNOT LEAD A DEMAGOGUE INSIGHT VIOLENCE. MODEL FOR CHILDREN THE KIND OF BULLYING BEHAVIOR THAT,  HONESTLY, YOU SEND SOMEBODY TO TIME OUT YOU ARE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.   I FEEL THAT EACH  OF US HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN  THIS. YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN SAYING WE NEED MORE LOVE AND KINDNESS AND  RESPECT IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW. THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE AGREE WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT  SET OF POLITICAL VIEWS JUST FOR  THE SAKE OF AGREEING. NO. BUT LET US FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK FOR SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE  GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY.  I WILL TELL YOU A STORY.  WHEN I WAS FIRST LADY, AFTER WE  LOST THE HEALTH CARE FIGHT,  BECAUSE REMEMBER, BEFORE WAS CALLED OBAMACARE IT WAS CALLED -- AND WHAT WE UNDERSTOOD WAS WE  HAD TO KEEP WORKING.  WE COULD NOT GET IT ALL AT ONCE.  SO I WENT TO WORK TO GET THE  CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE PROBLEM  AND BEFORE COMING OUT HERE I HAD  A YOUNG MAN SAY TO ME, A LONG  TIME AGO, THE LATE 1990'S,  ANCIENT HISTORY, HE SAID TO ME -- I WANT TO TAKE YOU BECAUSE  YOU SAVED MY FAMILY FROM  BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE OF THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM.  I COULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT IF WE HAD NOT WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS. IF WE HAD NOT SOUGHT AND FOUND COMMON GROUND TOGETHER. SO, AS I GO THROUGH THIS CAMPAIGN, I AM GOING TO STAND UP  FOR WHAT I BELIEVE. I AM GOING TO FIGHT FOR THE  ISSUES AND THE PLANS THAT I THINK WILL HELP MOVE OUR COUNTRY FORWARD. BUT I WILL ALWAYS SAY, I WILL GO ANYWHERE, ANYTIME, TO FIND THAT  COMMON GROUND. IF THERE IS GOOD FAITH, THEN MAYBE WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS.  MAYBE NOT AS MUCH AS I WOULD  LIKE, BUT ENOUGH THAT WE CAN  SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF SOME  AMERICANS. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE GOT TO START DOING AGAIN. WE HAVE GOT TO BE ABLE TO POINT TO THE RESULTS THAT MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER. WE HAVE GOT TO BE ABLE TO LIFT EACH OTHER UP, NOT PUT EACH OTHER DOWN BECAUSE PEOPLE  DISAGREE WITH US OR THEY DO NOT  HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY WHAT THEY  SAY. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GO TO THE  CAUCUSES ON SATURDAY, I HOPE THAT YOU WILL, AND EVERYBODY YOU TALK WITH, WILL REALLY THINK  ABOUT NOT ONLY THE CONSEQUENCES  AND THE STAKES OF THIS ELECTION,  BUT HOW FAR WE HAVE COME  TOGETHER.  I AM PROUD OF THE PROGRESS WE  HAVE MADE IN AMERICA.  I AM PROUD OF THE RIGHTS WE HAVE  EXTENDED TO PEOPLE.  I AM PROUD THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH THAT HAS REALLY MADE A  DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF NOT  JUST AMERICANS BUT PEOPLE AROUND  THE WORLD. I WENT TO 112 COUNTRIES WHEN I  WAS SECRETARY OF STATE AND I SAW  THAT EVEN WHEN COUNTRIES  DISAGREED WITH US, HOW THEY  WATCHED US. HOW THEY WONDERED HOW WE DID WHAT WE DID IN THIS BIG, SPRAWLING, PLURALISTIC COUNTRY  OF OURS.  HOW WE HELD IT TOGETHER. HOW WE MADE PROGRESS. I WAS ALWAYS SO PROUD. I DO NOT WANT TO LOSE THAT.  I WANT US TO CONTINUE TO MAKE  PROGRESS. I WANT US TO CONTINUE TO SEES THE FUTURE, MAKE IT WHAT IT  COULD BE. AND I PARTICULARLY BELIEVE THAT  ON BEHALF OF OUR CHILDREN. YOU KNOW, OUR VOLUNTEERS HERE IN  WASHINGTON PROVED EACH AND EVERY  DAY WHY I BELIEVE IN WHAT I AM  DOING AND WHY I KNOW THAT  TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE THE  DIFFERENCE IS I AM TALKING  ABOUT. LILLIAN ELLIS, JUST 14-YEARS-OLD, SKIPPED A  SLEEPOVER WITH HER FRIENDS TO  GET TRAINED AS A CAUCUS CAP THAN HERE IN'S -- CAUCUS CAP DENNY  HERE IN SEATTLE. JONATHAN AND JAMES FREBERG,  FATHER AND SON, HAVE BEEN KNOCKING ON DOORS FOR WEEKS. MARIA, AN IMMIGRANT FROM  ECUADOR, DREAMS OF BECOMING AN  AMERICAN CITIZEN AND HAS BEEN VOLUNTEERING 20 HOURS A WEEK FOR  US IN BELLEVUE. AND OF VALERIE, VALERIE, A  CAUCUS CAPTAIN ARRIVED ON SOCIAL  SECURITY AND FOOD STAMPS TO GET HIGH.  SHE WORRIES ABOUT RISING DRUG  PRICES, BUT SHE VOLUNTEERS EVERY  OTHER DAY BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT  WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE PROGRESS  TOGETHER. THAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT  HELPING PEOPLE LIKE HERS. YOU KNOW, IT IS EASY TO SAY WHAT  YOU ARE AGAINST.  LET'S START TALKING ABOUT WHAT  WE ARE FOR. THE PEOPLE WE ARE FOR.  WHO WE WANT TO HELP. THE DIFFERENCE WE WANT TO MAKE. THESE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT  AMERICA'S BEST DAYS LIE AHEAD  AND SAID WHY. IF YOU BELIEVE THAT, I HOPE YOU'LL COME OUT AND CAUCUS FOR ME THIS SATURDAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH SEATTLE!  GOD BLESS YOU ASKED NATION POINT  THANK YOU.   ",Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton Primary Night Speech

AND YOUR CONGRESSMAN, CONGRESSMAN GIAGO, THANK YOU SO MUCH.  HE IS NOT ONLY DOING A GREAT JOB REPRESENTING ARIZONA, HE IS BECOMING QUICKLY A LEADER IN WASHINGTON, AND BOY, DO WE NEED THAT.  SO THANK YOU SO MUCH, REUBEN.  AND I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS REMARKABLE COUPLE THAT YOU JUST HEARD FROM. I HAVE BEEN SO PLEASED TO HAVE   THEM BY MY SIDE AND SO MANY CAMPAIGN STOPS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW WHAT   CONGRESSWOMAN GABBY GIFFORDS MEANT TO THIS STATE.  YOU KNOW WHAT SHE DID FOR HER CONSTITUENTS.  AND I AM IN AWE OF HER COURAGE   AND HER COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE   TO SERVE PEOPLE BY STANDING UP AND SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THE GUN  LOBBY IN FAVOR OF COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY MEASURE SS.  AND BY HER SIDE, A MAN WHO HAS   SERVED OUR COUNTRY WITH SUCH DISTINCTION, AND I AM PLEASED TO  CALL HIM A FRIEND, NOT ONLY   BECAUSE OF THAT SERVICE HE HAS GIBB BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT HE'S CONTINUING TO DO BY GABBY'S SIDE, SPEAKING OUT, OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  AND AS THEY BOTH SAID, LIKE MANY  PEOPLE IN ARIZONA AND MANY PEOPLE AROUND OUR COUNTRY, THEY'VE BEEN GUN OWNERS FOR A   LONG TIME.  AND YOU KNOW WHAT?  THERE'S A RIGHT IN OUR COUNTRY   TO BE A GUN OWNER. WHAT WE ARE ADVOCATING, WHAT WE   ARE STANDING UP FOR AND SPEAKING  OUT FOR ARE COMMON SENSE GUN   REFORM MEASURES.  AND I ALSO WANT TO JUST   RECOGNIZE A COUPLE THAT I MET JUST BEFORE COMING IN.  LONNIE AND SANDY PHILLIPS WHO ARE HERE. THEY LOST THEIR DAUGHTER JESSIE   IN THE AURORA MOVIE THEATER MASSACRE.  AND THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO WHAT THEY COULD TO TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY AND TO SUE THE GUN MAKERS AND THE GUN SITE ONLINE WHERE THE MURDERER GOT ALL OF HIS AMMUNITION AND NOBODY ASKED   A QUESTION. AND THEY'RE TRYING TO RAISE THIS  TO A HIGH VISIBILITY. I CAN'T IMAGINE THE COURAGE THAT IT TAKES FOR PEOPLE LIKE GABBY   AND MARK AND THE PHILLIPS' SSESPHILLIPSES. I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR THEM.  WELL, TOMORROW'S A DAY RIGHT   HERE IN ARIZONA!  I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU.  THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION JUST  KEEP GETTING HIGHER AND HIGHER.  WHILE THE RHETORIC ON THE OTHER SIDE KEEPS GETTING LOWER AND LOWER.  THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYBODY IN ARIZONA TO GO OUT AND VOTE TOMORROW FOR THE KIND   OF FUTURE YOU WANT.  THE KIND OF PRESIDENT YOU WANT.  AND I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS.  I WANT YOU TO WANT ME. BECAUSE --   THANK YOU! THANK YOU!  WELL, HERE.  HERE'S WHY WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS TOGETHER.  BECAUSE SOMEBODY IS GOING TO   WALK IN TO THE OVAL OFFICE IN   JANUARY OF 2017.  AND THAT NEXT PRESIDENT IS GOING  TO SIT AT THE DESK AND START MAKING DECISIONS THAT WILL   AFFECT THE LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS OF AMERICANS.  AND I THINK THERE ARE THREE BIG TESTS THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL FACE.  FIRST, CAN YOU MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IN IMPROVING THE   LIVES OF AMERICANS? SECOND, CAN YOU KEEP US SAFE?  AND THIRD, CAN YOU BRING US TOGETHER AS A NATION?  WHICH IS WHERE WE SHOULD BE GOING.  NOW, IF YOU THINK ABOUT, CAN YOU MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE, I'VE  BEEN CAMPAIGNING ABOUT TEARING DOWN ALL THE BARE YERLRIERS THAT   STAMPBD IN THE WAY.  IT IS TIME AMERICANS GOT A RAISE  AND WE HAD MORE GOOD PAYING JOBS  FOR EVERY AMERICAN WHO WANTS TO WORK.  WE KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW   TO DO THIS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,   THE ECONOMY ALWAYS DOES BETTER WHEN THERE'S A DEMOCRAT IN THE   WHITE HOUSE.  YOU KNOW, MY HUSBAND WAS HERE   YESTERDAY IN TUCSON AND PHOENIX! AND HE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB 23   MILLION NEW JOBS, OVER 8 YEARS. AND INCOMES WENT UP FOR EVERYBODY. NOT JUST PEOPLE AT THE TOP.  PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE, WORKING PEOPLE, POOR PEOPLE.  EVERYBODY SAW THEIR INCOMES GO UP. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED? WHY DID IT STOP?  BECAUSE WE HAD A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT.  THAT'S THE EASIEST EXPLANATION. SOMEONE WHO SLASHED TAXES ON THE  WEALTHY, TOOK HIS EYES OFF OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE   MORTGAGE MARKETS AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. WE ELECTED ANOTHER NEW, YOUNG,   DYNAMIC DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT,   BARACK OBAMA.  AND WHEN HE WAS ELECTED, WE WERE  LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH.  9 MILLION AMERICANS LOST THEIR JOBS.  5 MILLION HOMES WERE LOST.  AND PEOPLE SAY, WELL, WHY ARE   SOME AMERICANS SO ANGRY?  WELL, ONE EXPLANATION IS THAT PEOPLE REALLY GOT KNOCKED DOWN SO HARD AND THEY DON'T THINK ANYBODY WAS LOOKING OUT FOR THEM.  THAT ANYBODY EVEN CARED FOR THEM.  I SAW PRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA SHORTLY AFTER THAT ELECTION.  HE SAID TO ME, IT IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN THEY TOLD US AND IT   WAS. AND I DON'T THINK HE GETS THE   CREDIT HE DESERVELSDESERVES FOR MAKING   SURE WE DIDN'T FALL INTO A GREAT DEPRESSION.  SO I'VE BEEN LAYING OUT WHAT I   WOULD DO TO BRING MORE JOBS AND TO INCREASE INCOMES. I KNOW WE CAN DO IT.  THERE ARE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES  OUT THERE.  JOBS IN INFRASTRUCTURE, ADVANCED  MANUFACTURING AND LET'S COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE BY CREATING MORE CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY JOBS.  LET'S DO MORE TO HELP SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES THAT CREATE TWO THIRDS OF ALL JOBS.  LET'S RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE SO   PEOPLE AREN'T WORKING IN POVERTY  AT THE END OF THE YEAR.  DESPITE WORKING FULL-TIME. AND, YES, IT IS WAY PAST TIME FOR WOMEN TO RECEIVE EQUAL PAY FOR OUR WORK.  WE COULD DO ALL OF THIS, MY FRIENDS.  SOMETHING ELSE WE CAN DO IS IMPROVE EDUCATION SO MORE YOUNG   PEOPLE GET OFF TO A GOOD START.  ARIZONA IS 45th IN THE NATION   WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION. 50th IN THE NATION WHEN IT COMES  TO PER CAPITA SPENDING FOR STUDENTS.  I BELIEVE THAT ARIZONA CAN AND   NEEDS TO DO BETTER. IF WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE JOBS OF THE FEW CHU WE'VE   GOT TO HAVE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE   EDUCATED FOR THOSE JOBS.  I WANT TO START WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION.  UNIVERSAL PRE-KINDERGARTEN.  I WANT TO BE A GOOD PARTNER WITH TEACHERS HERE IN ARIZONA AND ACROSS AMERICA.  AND I WANT TO MAKE COLLEGE   AFFORDABLE FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.  WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS WITH DEBT  FREE TUITION.  I HAVE A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN MY ESTEEMED   OPPONENT SENATOR SANDER WHO IS   SAYS FREE FOR EVERYBODY.  I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO PAY TO SEND DONALD TRUMP'S YOUNGEST CHILD FREE TO COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. NO, INSTEAD, I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON WHO NEEDS THE HELP, MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES, WORKING FAMILIES, STRIVING AND STRUGGLING POOR FAMILIES.  AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THE SUPPORT WE NEED   FROM STATES. I THINK IT IS WAY PAST TIME FOR STATES TO QUIT BUILDING MORE PRISONS AND INSTEAD LET'S INVEST  IN HIGHER EDUCATION AGAIN.  AND WE ARE GOING TO GO AFTER THE STUDENT DEBT PROBLEM.  IT IS WEIGHING DOWN SO MANY   YOUNG PEOPLE.  WE ARE GOING TO LET YOU REFINANCE YOUR DEBT.  GET OUT FROM UNDER THOSE HIGH   INTEREST RATES.  WE ARE GOING TO LET YOU MOVE IN   TO PROGRAMS WHERE YOU PAY IT BACK AS A PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME.  AND -- AND WE ARE GOING TO PUT   AN END DATE BECAUSE I DON'T   THINK YOU SHOULD STILL BE PAYING  BACK YOUR STUDENT DEBT.  IF YOU HAVE PAID IT EVERY MONTH   WHEN YOU'RE 50 OR 60 YEARS OLD,   THAT IS WRONG.  WE'RE GOING TO PUT AN END DATE AND WE ARE GOING TO RECIRCULATE   THE MONEY. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I  BORROWED MONEY BUT I DIDN'T FACE  WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY FACE.  I GOT TO PAY IT BACK AS A   PERCENT OF MY INCOME AND THAT MEANT I COULD GO TO WORK FOR THE  CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND WHICH IS  MY, YOU KNOW, MY JOB THAT REALLY GOT ME STARTED ON A LIFE OF SERVICE.  SO, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.  WE ARE ALSO GOING TO MAKE SURE WE FINISH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.  WE GET TO 100% UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.  BUT WE ARE GOING TO GET THE COSTS DOWN.  AND I HAVE TO SAY JUST A   PERSONAL WORD OF REGRET. YOU KNOW, BEFORE IT WAS CALLED   OBAMACARE IT WAS CALLED HILLARY CARE.  BACK IN '93 AND '94. AND WE WORKED REALLY HARD TO GET  TO QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH   CARE. WE WEREN'T SUCCESSFUL.  BUT WHAT I DID THEN IS TURN AROUND AND WORK WITH REPUBLICANS  AND DEMOCRATS TO CREATE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE   PROGRAM WHICH COVERS 8 MILLION   CHILDREN BUT I REGRET TO TELL YOU ARIZONA PULLED OUT OF THAT PROGRAM.  AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S A 3 TO 1   FEDERAL MATCH SO YOU GOT TO WONDER WHAT'S GOING ON IN TERMS   OF THE ARITHMETIC HERE.  BUT IT IS REALLY A SHAME BECAUSE  TO THIS DAY I MEET SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO TELL ME WHAT A DIFFERENCE THAT   MADE TO THEM AND TO THEIR   HEALTH. SO I'M GOING TO KEEP WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS   AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE AND WE   ARE GOING DO GO AFTER THE   PRESCRIPTION DRUG COMPANIES   BECAUSE THEY ARE CHARGING WAY   TOO MUCH.  SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE IN   PEOPLE'S LIVES.  THAT IS WHAT I'M COMMITTED TO. I'M ASKED ALL THE TIME, WELL, WHY DO YOU DO THIS?  I FEEL BLESSED.  I FEEL LIKE I HAD A GREAT FAMILY. I HAD PUBLIC SCHOOLS.  I HAD OPPORTUNITIES. I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERY PERSON  IN OUR COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE, HAVE THE CHANCE TO  LIVE UP TO THEIR GOD-GIVEN   POTENTIAL RIGHT HERE IN THE   UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  NOW, YOU KNOW, THE SECOND BIG TEST, CAN YOU KEEP US SAFE?  AND WHEN PEOPLE VOTE TOMORROW IN  THE PRIMARY, I HOPE THEY KNOW   THEY'RE VOTING FOR SOMEBODY WHO WILL NOT ONLY BE PRESIDENT, BUT   COMMANDER IN CHIEF.  AND I THINK -- I THINK IT'S   VERY --   I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT -- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE SOMEBODY IN THAT WHITE   HOUSE WHO UNDERSTANDS BOTH THE   CHALLENGES AND THE OPPORTUNITIES WE FACE IN AMERICA TODAY.  I SERVED AS YOU KNOW FOR EIGHT   YEARS AS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK  DURING THE 9/11 ATTACKS AND, OF   COURSE, I SERVED AS SECRETARY OF  STATE.  AND I WILL TELL YOU, ONLY THE   HARD CHOICES GET TO THE PRESIDENT'S DESK.  ONLY THE HARD CHOICES END UP IN THE SITUATION ROOM.  IF IT'S EASY, IT GETS MADE   SOMEWHERE ALONG THAT PATH.  BUT WHEN YOU ARE FACED WITH MAKING THOSE TOUGH DECISIONS,   LIKE WE WERE WHEN I WAS ONE OF   THE SMALL GROUP TO ADVISE THE PRESIDENT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT   TO GO AFTER BIN LADEN -- IT   TAKES EXPERIENCE AND IT TAKES TEMPERAMENT. AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE OUR   NEXT PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF CAN FULFILL THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY, IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY, IN A PRUDENT WAY.  AND I PLEDGE TO YOU THAT'S   EXACTLY WHAT I WILL DO IF I'M   HONORED ENOUGH TO BE THE NEXT   PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND THEN, FINALLY, YOU KNOW, THE NEXT AND LAST TEST IS CAN YOU   BRING US TOGETHER INSTEAD OF DRIVE US APART.  IT'S BEEN DEEPLY DISTRESSING TO   ME TO SEE THE DIVISIVENESS, THE MEAN SPIRITEDNESS, THE INCITEMENT OF VIOLENCE AND AGGRESSIVENESS IN THIS CAMPAIGN. I DON'T EVER REMEMBER ANYTHING LIKE IT, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.  I JUST DON'T.  YOU KNOW, PITTING GROUPS OF   AMERICANS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER,   IT JUST IS WRONG. THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE.  THAT'S NOT OUR VALUES.  THAT'S NOT WHAT WE STAND FOR. AND I DO BELIEVE WE ARE BETTER AND STRONGER AND MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN WE ARE COMING TOGETHER   INSTEAD OF MOVING APART.  AND SO, I WILL -- I WILL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO FIND COMMON GROUND.  I WILL GO ANYWHERE.  I WILL TALK TO ANYONE.  I WILL WORK 24/7 TO FIND COMMON GROUND, TO BRING INDIVIDUALS AND  GROUPS OF AMERICANS TOGETHER AGAIN. I UNDERSTAND AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING, SOME PEOPLE ARE INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED, AND YES,   THEY ARE ANGRY.  YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLKS?  ANGER IS NOT A STRATEGY.  WE HAVE GOT TO GET TOGETHER AND   FIGURE OUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO  MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES.  AND THEN WE HAVE GOT TO ROLL UP   OUR SLEEVES AND GET TO WORK. THAT IS WHAT I AM PROMISING YOU.  I AM PROMISING YOU THAT I WILL SPEND EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY WORKING, NUMBER ONE, TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN AMERICANS' LIVES. A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE THAT WILL   GIVE MORE PEOPLE GREATER OPPORTUNITY.  NUMBER TWO, TO KEEP US SAFE.  KEEP US SAFE HERE AT HOME, KEEP   US SAFE AND STRONG AROUND THE WORLD.  GO AFTER AND DEFEAT ISIS.  STAND UP FOR AMERICAN VALUES AND AMERICAN INTERESTS.  AND THAT I WILL BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. BEHIND ME YOU SEE SOME DISTINGUISHED AMERICANS, DON'T YOU?  WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS AND EXILES WHO CAME HERE FOR   BETTER OPPORTUNITY AND FOR OUR   HUMAN RIGHTS. AND WHEN I SEE PEOPLE LIKE SHERIFF ARAPAIO AND OTHERS WHO ARE TREATING FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS  WITH SUCH DISRESPECT, SUCH   CONTEMPT, IT JUST MAKES MY HEART SINK.  WE ARE BETTER THAN THAT.  I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR   COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM  WITH A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP!  BUT I CAN'T DO ANY OF THIS   WITHOUT YOUR HELP.  THAT IS WHY I NEED YOU TOMORROW.  I NEED YOU TO COME OUT AND TO   BRING EVERYBODY YOU POSSIBLY CAN!  COME OUT AND VOTE AND LET'S HAVE  THE FUTURE WE DESERVE IN AMERICA!

WE ARE CREATING MORE GOOD JOBS WITH CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY. WE HAVE TO TAKE CLIMATE CHANGE SERIOUSLY. WE ARE GOING TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES. THE FASTEST-GROWING SEGMENT OF SMALL BUSINESS ARE MINORITY OWNED AND WOMEN OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES. THE FACETS OF ALL OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN WHO ARE CREATING SMALL BUSINESSES THAT -- FASTER THAN EVERYBODY. I WANT TO BE A SMALL BUSINESS PRESIDENT. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO FIGHT TO LIFT THE MINIMUM AGE -- WAGE. AND FINALLY WE ARE GOING TO GET EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN'S WORK. EVERYTHING I HAVE JUST SAID, THE REPUBLICANS DISAGREE WITH. WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US. THAT IS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO TURN OUT TOMORROW. THE SOONER I CAN BECOME YOUR NOMINEE, THE MORE I CAN BEGIN TO TURN OUR ATTENTION TO THE REPUBLICANS. WE ALSO HAVE TO BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. LET'S GET TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. LET'S TACKLE OUR PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS AND LET'S MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CHILD IN EVERY ZIP CODE GET A FIRST-CLASS EDUCATION IN AMERICA.  I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THAT THE DETROIT PUBLIC SCHOOLS UNDER IN EMERGENCY MANAGER IS IN WORSE SHAPE THAN BEFORE. YOU HAVE PRECIOUS CHILDREN AND CLASSROOMS FILLED WITH MOLES AND RODENTS. THE GOVERNOR SHOULD TURN BACK THE CONTROL OF THE SCHOOL TO THE PEOPLE OF DETROIT. WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SO MORE KIDS CAN SUCCEED AND SCHOOLS. WE NEED TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE AGAIN. I HAVE A PLAN TO DO THAT WHICH I HAVE LAID OUT ON MY WEBSITE. I HOPE YOU WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT. WE ALSO NEED TO GET DEBTS DOWN. WE NEED TO REFINANCE THE DEBT THAT STUDENTS CURRENTLY HAVE. LET'S REMEMBER THAT AMONG THE BARRIERS WE HAVE TO TACKLE OUR BARRIERS OF BIGOTRY AND PREJUDICE. LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE SYSTEMIC RACISM. WE HAVE SYSTEMIC PREJUDICE. WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HELD BACK, WHO ARE CUT OUT OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, WHERE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, WHERE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE, WHERE THE RATE OF INCARCERATION IS MUCH TOO HIGH ACROSS AFRICAN-AMERICANS. BECAUSE OF THE KIND OF CAMPAIGN THAT REPUBLICANS ARE RUNNING, WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ATTACKED. RIGHT? YOU HAVE TO SAY THIS ABOUT HIM. HE IS AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY ATTACKER. HE HAS ATTACKED MEXICANS, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, WOMEN, HE HAS ATTACKED MUSLIMS. HE HAS GONE AFTER EVERYONE. WE WILL NOT LEAD A PERSON LIKE THAT EVER BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.  WE HAVE GOT TO WORK TOGETHER. WE NEED TO UNIFY OUR COUNTRY, NOT DIVIDED. THE REPUBLICANS ARE AGAINST NEARLY EVERY RIGHT WE HAVE EVER ACHIEVED. I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHERE I STAND. I AM FOR A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN HEALTH CARE DECISION, I WILL DEFEND PLANNED PARENTHOOD. I WILL DEFEND MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND TRY TO END DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY. I WILL FIGHT FOR VOTING RIGHTS WHICH ARE UNDER ATTACK ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. I WILL APPOINT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES WHO REVERSED USE IT -- REVERSED CITIZENS UNITED. SPEAKING OF THE SUPREME COURT, I AM 100% SUPPORTED OF -- SUPPORTIVE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RIGHTS -- RIGHT TO NOMINATE A JUSTICE. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO FIGHT HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET COMPREHENSIVE INCOME -- IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP. WE WILL CHANGE WHAT DOESN'T WORK IN THE V.A. BECAUSE OUR VETERANS DESERVE NOTHING LESS THAN WORLD-CLASS HEALTH CARE. WE WILL NOT LET THE REPUBLICANS PRIVATIZE THE V.A. AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM PRIVATIZE SOCIAL SECURITY. I WANT THE YOUNG PEOPLE HERE TO BELIEVE AND KNOW THAT THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND WILL BE THERE FOR YOU WHEN YOU GET TO THE AGE WHERE YOU CAN DRAW FROM IT. I WILL KEEP WORKING FOR SENSIBLE GUN SAFETY MEASURES. I AM ABSOLUTELY AMAZED AT THE REFUSAL OF THE GUN LOBBY TO WORK TO TRY TO PROTECT LIVES. YOU CAN DO THAT IN A CONSTITUTIONAL MANNER, MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. OUR COUNTRY DID IT FOR ABOUT 200 YEARS. WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO DOING IT TOGETHER. LET ME SAY A QUICK WORD ABOUT FOREIGN RELATIONS OF AND -- AND NATIONAL SECURITY. YOU ARE ALSO VOTING FOR A COMMANDER IN CHIEF. I WANT TO MAKE A SERIOUS POINT ABOUT DEFEATING TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY AT TERRORIST NETWORK LIKE ISIS. WE HAVE TO LEAD AN AIR CAMPAIGN, WE HAVE TO SUPPORT FIGHTERS ON THE GROUND WERE WILLING TO GO AFTER ISIS BUT WE WILL NOT SEND AMERICAN COMBAT TROOPS TO SYRIA OR IRAQ. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS THE RIGHT APPROACH. I WANT TO SAY A PARTICULAR WORD TO ALL OF THE MUSLIMS THAT ARE HERE. WHEREVER THEY LIVE. I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE AND I KNOW THAT AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE TO HELP US DO THAT ARE MUSLIM AMERICAN FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.  WHEN YOU HEAR THE KIND OF BIGOTRY AND BLUSTER COMING FROM THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, NOT ONLY MAKING VERY INTIMIDATING MARKS ABOUT AMERICAN MUSLIMS, BUT ALSO PREVENTING THEM FROM COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. INSULTING ONE OF THE GREAT RELIGIONS IN THE WORLD, THIS IS NOT ONLY OFFENSIVE AND SHAMEFUL, THAT IS DANGEROUS. AND IT'S ALSO COUNTERPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO PUT COALITIONS TOGETHER. I PUT A COALITION TOGETHER THAT IMPOSED SANCTIONS ON IRAN, THAT LED TO NEGOTIATIONS. IF WE ARE GOING TO GO AFTER TERRORISTS NETWORKS LIKE ISIS, WE NEED TO BUILD A COALITION WITH MUSLIM NATIONS. IMAGINE SOMEONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAYING WHAT WE ARE HEARING COMING FROM THAT SITE. YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT EASY TO PUT TOGETHER COALITIONS? IT MATTERS WHAT YOU SAY IF YOU ARE SAYING WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! WE HAVE WORK TO DO. I AM EXCITED ABOUT DOING IT WITH ALL OF YOU. BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT AMERICA'S BEST DAYS CAN BE AHEAD OF US IF WE DO WHAT WE MUST DO TO BUILD BRIDGES INSTEAD OF WALLS, TO NOT DOWN BARRIERS -- KNOCK DOWN BARRIERS. I CAN DO THAT UNLESS YOU BRING OUT EVERYONE YOU KNOW TO VOTE FOR ME TOMORROW. I WILL TELL YOU THIS. IF YOU COME OUT AND VOTE FOR ME TOMORROW, I WILL WORK FOR YOU AND FIGHT FOR YOU THROUGH THIS CAMPAIGN AND INTO THE WHITE HOUSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MICHIGAN! GOD BLESS YOU.   I AM THE CHAMPION, YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ME MORE -- ROAR  LOUDER THAN THE LION, BECAUSE I AM THE CHAMPION YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ME ROAR  YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ME ROAR  I GOT THE EYE OF THE TIGER, THE FIRE DANCING THROUGH THE FIRE, BECAUSE I AM THE CHAMPION YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ME ROAR  BECAUSE I AM THE CHAMPION AND YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ME ROAR  YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ME ROAR  I GOT THE EYE OF THE TIGER, THE FIRE DANCING THROUGH THE FIRE YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ME ROAR OH OH OH OH OH YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ME MORE  REMEMBER EVERYTHING WE SHARED, REMEMBER HER REMEMBER UNITY, REMEMBER LOVING NEIGHBORS WITHOUT EXPECTING FAVORS IF YOU'D KNOWLEDGE THE PAIN -- ACKNOWLEDGE THE PAIN PEOPLE WALKING HAND-IN-HAND  LOOK AT ME, LOOK YOU  LOOK AROUND","Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally in Detroit, Michigan"
50,2016-03-04,http://www.c-span.org/video/?405998-1/hillary-clinton-remarks-detroit-michigan,"[u'announcer', u'hillary clinton', u'(music)', u'(music)']",Clinton,"  THANK YOU, WOW. I AM SO EXCITED TO BE HERE. I APPRECIATE A SHORT TOUR I JUST HAD AND THE INFORMATION THAT I WAS GIVEN. I WANT TO THANK DETROIT MANUFACTURING SERVICES FOR WELCOMING US HERE TODAY. I WANT TO THANK THEM ESPECIALLY FOR GIVING SO MANY HARD-WORKING PEOPLE THE CHANCE TO GET -- MAKE A GOOD LIVING WITH A GOOD JOB WITH BENEFITS, AND UNION REPRESENTATION. IT ALL AS A -- ADDS UP.  I WANT TO THANK THE CEO OF DMS. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS THE LARGEST WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS IN MICHIGAN.  AND ONE OF THE LARGEST NATIVE AMERICAN OWNED BUSINESSES IN AMERICA.  IT IS ALSO GREAT TO BE HERE WITH SO MANY OF MY FRIENDS, MY FORMER COLLEAGUES. I AM THRILLED TO BE IN DETROIT. I WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR. WHERE IS THE MAYOR? THANK YOU, MAYOR DUGGAN, FOR EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING. I WANT TO THANK SENATOR DEBBIE STEVAN NOW, MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE. CONGRESSMAN JOHN CONYERS, HE HAS THAT RED JACKET ON. YOU CAN SEE HIM. CONGRESSWOMAN BRENDA LAWRENCE, THANK YOU. MY LONGTIME FRIEND, CONGRESSWOMAN EDDIE DINGLE. -- DEBBIE DINGELL. AND OF COURSE I WANT TO RECOGNIZE A LEGEND, YOU MAY THINK I AM TALKING ABOUT HIS STORIED CAREER IN THE CONGRESS, OF COURSE I AM. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT FORMER CONGRESSMAN, JOHN DINGELL IS A SOCIAL MEDIA SENSATION.  HE IS THE KING OF TWITTER. AND I AM SO PLEASED HE IS HERE TODAY. I WANT TO THANK FORMER GOVERNOR, JIM BLANCHARD AND PLAN -- JANET BLANCHARD.  WE HAVE SOME GREAT UNION LEADERS HERE. THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UAW, BLOCKING. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. -- BOB KING. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WE HAVE MARCH ROBINSON. -- MARGE ROBINSON. AND AL GARRETT, THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING WITH ME. I DELIBERATELY CHOSE TO COME TO DETROIT, AND TO COME TO THIS COMPANY TO TALK ABOUT JOBS. BECAUSE I WANT MORE PEOPLE TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN SOUTHWEST DETROIT AND MIDTOWN, AND EASTERN MARKET. NEW BUSINESSES ARE OPENING. FAMILIES ARE MOVING IN. THE STREETLIGHTS ARE ON AGAIN. THE BUSES ARE RUNNING. THERE IS A PALPABLE FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMUNITY. WE HAVE TO SPREAD THE ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION TO ALL OF DETROIT'S NEIGHBORHOODS. YOU CAN DO IT, BECAUSE LOOK HOW FAR YOU HAVE COME. THANKS TO YOUR HARD WORK, THE AUTO INDUSTRY JUST HAD ITS BEST YEAR EVER.  INNOVATION IS ON THE RISE BETWEEN THE CARMAKERS AND SUPPLIERS, THE CLEAN ENERGY SECTOR, THE DEFENSE COURT ORDER, HIGH-TECH FIRMS IN ANN ARBOR, CUTTING EDGE DESIGN HAPPENING IN GRAND RAPIDS, THE NEXT GENERATION OF ENGINEERS GETTING TRAINED UP AND SO MUCH ELSE, YOUR HARD WORK, DOING WHAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS DONE -- MAKING AND DESIGNING THINGS THAT AMERICA NEEDS AND THE WORLD ONCE IS ONCE AGAIN GOING STRONG. I AM SO GRATEFUL TO EVERYBODY WHO PLAYED A PART IN THAT. LAST NIGHT DETROIT PLAYED A DIFFERENT ROLE, DIDN'T? HOSTING THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT -- I GUESS, DEBATE. THERE WERE SO MANY INSULTS, BACK-AND-FORTH, IT WAS HARD TO KEEP TRACK. THE BIGGEST INSULT OF ALL WAS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE ECONOMY --   THE ECONOMY WHICH SHOULD BE AT THE TOP OF ANY LIST THAT ANYBODY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAS WAS BASICALLY AN AFTERTHOUGHT. MAYBE THAT IS BECAUSE ALL OF THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES SUPPORT THE SAME FAILED POLICIES. CUT TAXES FOR THE RICH. GET OUT OF THE WAY OF CORPORATIONS. DON'T RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE, IN FACT THE FRONT RUNNER SAYS HE THINKS WAGES ARE TOO HIGH IN THE COUNTRY. AND FLASH GOVERNMENT TO THE BONE -- SLASH GOVERNMENT TO THE BONE. NOTE PRICE, THEY ALL CRITICIZED OR OPPOSED THE OTHER RISK. -- THE AUTO RESCUE. WHAT WAS MISSING LAST NIGHT WAS AN HONEST RECKONING WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC CHALLENGE. HOW DO WE RAISE INCOMES AND CREATE GOOD JOBS OF THE FUTURE? ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, WE AGREE ON A NUMBER OF THINGS. I DON'T THINK WE CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION BY RINA -- REFIGHTING BALLOT -- BATTLES FROM 20 YEARS AGO. ANYONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OWES IT TO YOU TO COME UP WITH REAL IDEAS. NOT AN IDEOLOGY, NOT AN OLD SET OF TALKING POINTS, BUT A CREDIBLE STRATEGY DESIGNED FOR THE WORLD WE LIVE IN NOW. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I AM HERE TODAY TO DO.  YOU KNOW IN AMERICA IF YOU WORK HARD AND YOU DO YOUR PART, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, OR WHERE YOU STARTED OUT. THAT IS THE BASIC BARGAIN THAT MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. BUT FOR MANY AMERICANS, THAT NO LONGER HOLDS TRUE. TOO MANY BARRIERS HOLD BACK OUR FAMILIES. OUR ECONOMY, AND BECAUSE OF THAT, OUR COUNTRY. INSTEAD OF GOOD PAYING JOBS, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE STUCK IN LOW-WAGE WORK. CORPORATE PROFITS AND CEO PAY KEEPS RISING. PAYCHECKS FOR WORKING FAMILIES HAVE BARELY BUNCHED. -- BUDGED. INSTEAD OF AFFORDABLE COLLEGE WE HAVE SKYROCKETING TUITION AND MILLIONS WEIGHED DOWN BY STUDENT DEBT. MORE WOMEN THAN EVER ARE THE MAIN BREADWINNERS, OR CO-BREADWINNERS, BUT THEY STILL DO NOT GET EQUAL PAY. AND --   AND THE UNIONS THAT HELP BUILD OUR COUNTRY, AND THE MIDDLE CLASS ARE UNDER CONCERTED ATTACK. IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT AMERICANS ARE ANGRY, IS IT? FOLKS WORK HARD ALL DAY, AND THEN LIE AWAKE ALL NIGHT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW IN THE WORLD THEY ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THEIR KIDS COLLEGE, OR A NEW ROOF, OR MAKING SURE MOM GETS THE CARE SHE NEEDS. FOR SOME PARENTS, IT IS EVEN WORSE. THEY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THE WATER THEIR KIDS DRINK IS POISONOUS. LIKE THE FAMILY'S INFLUENCE -- FAMILIES IN FLINT. OR ABOUT THEIR SCHOOLS THAT ARE CRUMBLING AND RODENT INFESTED LIKE MANY HERE IN DETROIT. THAT IS NOT THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN AMERICA.  SOME OF THE BLAME FOR THESE CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY RESTS WITH BIG, HISTORIC FORCES LIKE TRADE AND TECHNOLOGY. WALL STREET AND SOME OF OUR CORPORATIONS ALSO HOWEVER THERE A LOT OF -- HOWEVER, BEAR A LOT OF SPOTS ABILITY. TOO MANY IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY FORGOT THAT THE PURPOSE OF THINKING IS TO GET CAPITAL TO MAKE STREET -- TO MAIN STREET TO INVEST IN NEW BUSINESSES, OR EXPAND SUCCESSFUL ONES LIKE THIS OF ANY SIZE, AND TO INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP AND UNITY DEVELOPMENT. -- COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. IT IS NOT TO CREATE HUGE RICHES FOR A SELECT FEW AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE ELSE. MEANWHILE, TOO MANY LEADERS IN CORPORATE AMERICA ARE PRIORITIZING THEIR SHORT-TERM STOCK PRICE OVER THEIR WORKERS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE CANNOT FORGET THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS, AND RIGHT WING IDEOLOGUES WHO BELIEVE IN WEAKENING GOVERNMENT OWNED -- OVERSIGHT. MASSIVE TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH, RIPPING AWAY TO SAFETY NET, AND BREAKING THE BACKS OF UNIONS. AS DETROIT PROVES, EVERY DAY, WHAT HAS BEEN BROKEN CAN BE REBUILT. STRONGER THAN BEFORE.  YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT THIS CAN -- CAMPAIGN I HAVE SAID THAT CREATING GOOD PAYING JOBS, AND RAISING INCOME IS THE DEFINING ECONOMIC CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME. AND THAT IN ORDER TO GET WHERE I WANT US TO GO WE NEED GROWTH THAT IS STRONG, FAIR, AND LONG-TERM. THAT IS WHY WE NEED A NEW BARGAIN FOR THE NEW ECONOMY. A NEW BARGAIN TO ENSURE THAT THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE ARE GOOD PAYING, AMERICAN JOBS. THE KIND THAT PROVIDE BOTH GOOD INCOME, AND THE DIGNITY, PRIDE, AND SINCE THE PURPOSE THAT COME WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO WHEN YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING. THE PEOPLE THAT I MET AS I WAS WALKING HERE WITH ED WERE ALL PEOPLE WHO FIT THAT DESCRIPTION. PROUD OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING. GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF A TEAM THAT RESPECTS ONE ANOTHER. LOOKING TO CONTINUE THE GROWTH THAT THIS COMPANY HAS ENJOYED. THAT IS THE KIND OF JOBS WE WANT. YOU ARE CREATING THEM AGAIN IN MICHIGAN. SOME OF THE MOST EXCITING, TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS ARE HAPPENING RIGHT HERE. NOT IN CHINA. NOT IN GERMANY. BUT IN MICHIGAN.  YOU USED TO MAKE BE 24 BOMBERS AT WILLOW RUN. NOW YOU ARE DEVELOPING DRIVERLESS CARS. THAT MAKE WIND TURBINES POSSIBLE . CHEVY IS MAKING ELECTRIC CARS AND USING CLEAN ENERGY TO DO IT. CHINA LET HAS CREATED MORE THAN 500 JOBS, AND THEY CORNERED THE MARKET ON WATCHES FOR PRESIDENT S. BOTH MY HUSBAND AND PRESIDENT OBAMA LOVE THEIR SHINOLAS. MICHIGAN PROVES EVERY DAY THAT AMERICAN WORKERS ARE THE BEST IN THE WORLD. ALL THEY NEED IS A FAIR CHANCE ON A FAIR PLAYING FIELD. THAT IS WHY WE NEED THIS NEW BARGAIN. HERE IS WHAT IT SHOULD BE. FIRST, CORPORATIONS HAVE TO DO RIGHT BY THEIR COMMUNITIES, AND OUR COUNTRY. CORPORATIONS BENEFIT IN SO MANY WAYS FROM BEING RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. TOO OFTEN THIS RELATIONSHIP FEELS LIKE A ONE RATES -- ONE WAY STREET. TOO MANY ARE NOT HOLDING UP THEIR END OF THE BARGAIN. THEY DO NOT RECOGNIZE THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST ASSETS ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET IS AMERICA. PART OF THE PROBLEM IS A CASINO CULTURE ON WALL STREET THAT FOR TOO LONG PUT SHORT-TERM SPECULATION AHEAD OF LONG-TERM STRENGTH. IT ASKS TAXPAYERS TO HOLD THE BAG ANY BETS GO BAD. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WALL STREET NEVER THREATENS RAIN STREET AGAIN -- MAIN STREET AGAIN.  AS I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES, NO BANK CAN BE TOO BIG TO FAIL. NO EXECUTIVE TOO POWERFUL TO JAIL.  BUT -- BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW BAD BEHAVIOR ON WALL STREET AND PRESSURE TO MEET QUARTERLY EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS CONTRIBUTES TO BAD BEHAVIOR ACROSS CORPORATE AMERICA. LOOK AT COMPANIES LIKE NABISCO, LAYING OFF 600 WORKERS IN CHICAGO, AND MOVING PRODUCTION TO MEXICO. EVEN THOUGH THE COMPANY HAS A LONG -- HAS LONG RECEIVED TAX BREAKS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM TAKING TAXPAYER DOLLARS WITH ONE HAND, AND GIVING OUT PINK SLIPS WITH THE OTHER. LOOK AT THE GROWING NUMBER OF COMPANIES MOVING THEIR HEADQUARTERS OVERSEAS JUST SO THEY CAN AVOID PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES HERE AT HOME. ONE COMPANY DOING THAT RIGHT NOW IS CALLED JOHNSON CONTROL, THEY MAKE CARPARKS -- CARP PARTS/ . THE ACTUALLY LOBBIED FOR AN BENEFITED FROM THE AUTO RESCUE OF 2008. THEY WENT TO WASHINGTON WITH EVERYONE ELSE AND ASKED. FOR HELP. THE REPUBLICANS SAID, NO, WE WILL NOT HELP YOU. JOBS AND FAMILIES ARE AT STAKE. EVERYONE HERE, ALL OF US TAXPAYERS, WE HELPED TO SAVE JOHNSON CONTROLS. ON THEIR WEBSITE, THEY TALK ABOUT THEIR CONTRACTS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THEY SAY THAT KEEPING THE COUNTRY SAFE AND PROSPEROUS IS, AND I QUOTE, THE PATRIOTIC THING TO DO. I HOPE THEY DO THE PATRIOTIC THING AND STAY IN AMERICA. AND PAY THE TAXES THAT THEY OH FOR EVERYTHING WE -- THAT THEY OWE FOR EVERYTHING WE HAVE DONE FOR THEM.  LOOK, I AM NOT INTERESTED IN CONDEMNING WHOLE CATEGORIES OF BUSINESSES, OR THE ENTIRE PRIVATE SECTOR, OF COURSE NOT. I WANT TO SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE TO EVERY BOARDROOM AND EXECUTIVE SUITE. IF YOU CHEAT YOUR EMPLOYEES, YOU EXPLOIT CUSTOMERS, YOU POLLUTE THE ENVIRONMENT, OR RIP OFF TAXPAYERS, WE WILL HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE. THIS COUNTRY HAS GIVEN YOU SO MUCH.  IF YOU DESERT AMERICA, YOU WILL PAY A PRICE. DO THE RIGHT THING -- INVEST IN THE WORKERS, AND YOUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE, WE WILL STAND WITH YOU. HERE'S HOW IT SHOULD WORK, TO DISCOURAGE BAD BEHAVIOR, WE WILL MAKE COMPANIES PAY FOR WHAT ARE CALLED INVERSIONS UNDER THE TAX CODE. WHICH MEANS THEY PRETEND TO SELL THEMSELVES TO ACCOMPANY OVERSEAS, AND THEN THEY PRETEND TO MOVE THEIR HEADQUARTERS OVERSEAS. I CALL IT A PER VERSION UNDER THE TAX CODE IT IS CALLED AN IN VERSION. WE WILL MAKE YOU PAY FOR THAT WITH A NEW EXIT TAX. IF A COMPANY LIKE NABISCO OUTSOURCES AND SHIPS JOBS OVERSEAS WE WILL MAKE YOU GET BACK THE TAX BREAKS YOU RECEIVED HERE IN AMERICA. IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO INVEST IN US, WHY SHOULD TAXPAYERS INVEST IN YOU.  LET'S TAKE THAT MONEY AND PUT IT TO WORK IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND. DOING COURAGE GOOD BEHAVIOR, LET'S ENACT POLICIES THAT PROMOTE LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS, LIKE CAPITAL GAINS TAXES THAT ONLY SCALE DOWNWARD FOR TRULY MULTITIER INVESTMENTS -- MULTIYEAR INVESTMENTS, BUT ARE HIGHER FOR SHORT-TERM. LET'S PROMOTE INSHORE INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT WITH NEW TAX CREDITS THAT MAKE IT PROFITABLE TO TAKE THE HIGH ROAD RATHER THAN THE LOW ROAD. LIKE MICHIGAN LADDER COMPANY, WHICH HAS BEEN OPERATING FOR OVER A CENTURY. THEY HAVE STOPPED BUYING FIBERGLASS LADDERS FROM SUPPLIERS IN CHINA, AND STARTED MAKING THEM HERE IN MICHIGAN. I KNOW IT MADE MORE FINANCIAL SENSE. WE HAVE GOT TO HELP OTHER COMPANIES DISCOVER WHAT THEY CAN DO AS WELL. I AM NOT ASKING CORPORATIONS TO BE CHARITABLE, ALTHOUGH THAT IS IMPORTANT. I AM ASKING CORPORATIONS TO REALIZE THAT WHEN AMERICANS PROSPER, THEY PROSPER AS WELL. THE IDEA OF CORPORATE PATRIOTISM MIGHT SOUND --  THE SMART THING TO DO AS WELL. THAT LEAVES TO THE SECOND PART OF THE NEW BARGAIN, COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO START TREATING WORKERS LIKE ASSETS TO BE INVESTED IN, NOT COST TO BE CUT.  LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING, THESE DAYS ARE BIGGEST COMPANIES RETURN EIGHT OR NINE OUT OF EVERY $10 THEY EARN DIRECTLY BACK TO SHAREHOLDERS. EITHER IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OR STOCK BUYBACKS. THEY ARE ALSO -- MANY OF THEM SITTING ON HUGE CASH RESERVES. OFTEN STASHED IN FOREIGN TAX HAVENS. THAT IS MONEY THEY ARE NOT USING TO TRAIN THEIR WORKERS, OR GIVE THEM A RAISE. EVEN WORSE, THE LINK BETWEEN RISING PRODUCTIVITY AND RISING PAY HAS SNAPPED. PRODUCTIVITY GOES UP STILL, PROFITS GO UP, EXECUTIVE PAY GOES UP, STOCK PRICES GO UP, BUT WORKERS ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND. IN AN ECONOMY THAT IS 70% CONSUMPTION, THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM. IT IS NOT HAVE TO BE THAT WAY. IN THE 1990'S, WHEN WE HAD ANOTHER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT THAT I THINK DID A GOOD JOB.  IN THE 1990'S -- WHEN PRODUCTIVITY ROSE, THE TYPICAL FAMILY INCOME ALSO ROSE BY $10,000. SOME OF YOU REMEMBER THAT. IN FACT AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILY INCOME WENT UP AS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY JOBS AND PEOPLE REALLY MAKING PROGRESS. IT IS GOOD FOR EVERYONE WHEN WORKERS'S INCOMES GO UP. AMERICA GROWS WITH YOUR PAYCHECK ROSE. -- WHEN YOUR PAYCHECK GROWS. THIS IS -- MOSTLY JUST HELPS WEALTHY PEOPLE. FOR MANY IN THE HANDS OF WORKING PEOPLE HELPS EVERYONE, INCLUDING BUSINESSES. THAT IS WHY WE SHOULD RAISE THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE.  AND FIGHT FOR EVEN HIGHER MINIMUM WAGES IN PLACES WHERE THAT MAKE SENSE. -- MAKES SENSE. IT IS WHY WE SHOULD PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR COMPANIES THAT INVEST IN TRAINING FOR EMPLOYEES, WHICH CAN LEAD TO HIGHER PAYING JOBS. WE SHOULD CREATE A TAX CREDIT FOR EMPLOYERS THAT SHARE PROFITS WITH THEIR WORKERS. AUTOMAKERS HERE IN DETROIT KNOW THE VALUE OF TRANSPARENT PROFIT-SHARING PLANS THAT COME ON TOP OF IT WAGES. -- A GOOD WAY TO. -- GOOD WAGES. WE HAVE TO TAKE ON A GOOD REASON WHY PAYCHECKS HAVE NOT MOVED AND GOOD JOBS ARE SCARCE. THAT IS THE DIMINISHING POWER OF LABOR UNIONS.  AS YOU KNOW WELL, UNIONS HELPED TO BRING BACK THE AUTO INDUSTRY.  NO ONE GAVE MORE TO DETROIT AND MICHIGAN DURING THESE PAST FEW YEARS. UNION MEMBERS BUILD THE CITY'S, -- BUILD THE CITIES, KEEP THE LIGHTS ON, AND CARE FOR OUR CHILDREN. THE RELENTLESS ASSAULT ON LABOR, AND THE EROSION OF WORKER BARGAINING POWER HAS NOT ONLY AFFECTED WORKER PAY, IT IS ALSO A KEY REASON WHY OVERTIME RULES HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED IN DECADES. AND WHY FAMILY-FRIENDLY POLICIES LIKE PAID LEAVE, EARNED SICK DAYS, AND FAIR SCHEDULING HAVE NOT BEEN WIDELY EMBRACED.  -- INEQUALITY HAS BEEN WIDENED BY THE DECLINES OF UNIONS AS WELL. WE DID STAND UP TO REPUBLICANS IN WASHINGTON AND THE HOUSE IS LIKE HERE IN MICHIGAN, WHO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN.  TO REDUCE UNION POWER. WE NEED TO STAND UP FOR WORKERS. WHEN UNIONS ARE STAND -- STRONG, FAMILIES ARE WRONG AND AMERICA'S WRONG -- AND AMERICA IS STRONG.  THE THIRD PART OF THE NEW BARGAIN IS GOVERNMENT STEPPING UP TOO. TOO OFTEN WASHINGTON ONLY WORKS FOR THE WEALTHY AND THE WELL-CONNECTED. YOU KNOW IT, I KNOW IT, EVERYONE KNOWS IT. LIKE WHAT REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS THAT WHEN THEY CUT OFF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS ARE PEOPLE LAID OFF IN THE GREAT RECESSION WHO WERE STILL WORKING, -- LOOKING WORK. -- LOOKING FOR WORK. DARWIN CANDIDATE THOMAS TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX CUTS TO GO MOSTLY TO THE RICH. THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE. AMERICAN INTEREST HAVE TO COME BEFORE SPECIAL INTEREST. AMERICAN WORKERS AND JOBS HAVE TO COME FIRST. ONE AREA WHERE WE HAVE GOT ME BALANCE WRONG OVER THE YEARS IS TRADE. THE GOOD NEWS IS, AMERICA'S EXPORTS ARE UP 40% UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA.  I WAS PROUD TO WORK WITH HIM ON THAT WHEN I WAS PRECARIOUS -- I WAS PROUD TO WORK WITH HIM ON THAT WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF STATE. THERE ARE REAL BENEFITS. LOOKING BACK OVER THE LAST DECADE, AS GLOBALIZATION PICKED UP STEAM, THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE BENEFITS OF TRADE HAVE NOT BEEN AS WIDELY ENJOYED AS MANY PREDICTED. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION FAILED TO ENFORCE OUR TRADE LAWS OR STAND UP TO CHINA. CORPORATIONS MAY HAVE ONE GOT -- WON, BUT MANY WORKERS LOST. THEY LOST JOBS, THEIR SENSE OF PURPOSE. CHEAPER GOODS ARE NO SUBSTITUTE. AMERICA HAS TO DO BETTER. THERE ARE PEOPLE IN BOTH PARTIES WHO THINK WE CAN SOMEHOW SHUT OURSELVES OFF NOR -- OFF FROM THE WORLD. EVEN IF THE UNITED STATES NEVER SIGNED ANOTHER TRADE DEAL, GLOBALIZATION IS NOT GOING AWAY. OUR CHALLENGE IS TO ESTABLISH AND ENFORCE FAIR RULES SO OUR WORKERS COMPETE ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD, AND COUNTRIES DO NOT RACE TO THE BOTTOM ON LABOR, THE ENVIRONMENT, AND SO MUCH ELSE. THE WAY WE ENFORCE TRADE RULES RIGHT NOW IS COMPLETELY BACKWARDS. WE PUT THE BURDEN OF INITIATING TRADE CASES ON WORKERS AND UNIONS. WE DO NOT TAKE ACTION UNTIL AFTER THE DAMAGE IS DONE. WHICH OFTEN MEANS, AFTER WORKERS ARE LAID OFF. THAT IS RIDICULOUS. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ENFORCING THE LAW FROM THE BEGINNING SO WORKERS CAN FOCUS ON DOING THEIR JOBS.  AND ENFORCING TRADE LAWS, MEANS DEALING WITH ONE COUNTRY ABOVE ALL, CHINA. WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE CHINA IS BY FAR THE WORST RULE BREAKER IN THE WORLD. IT DUMPS CHEAP PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET. SUBSIDIZES STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES WHO UNDERSELL AND THE GLOBAL MARKET TO HURT OUR COMPANIES. IT DISCRIMINATES AGAINST AMERICAN COMPANIES. NOW THAT CHINA'S ECONOMY IS SLOWING DOWN, WE CAN EXPECT EVEN MORE BAD ACTS FROM THEM. IT WILL LOOK TO DUMP PRODUCTS OVERSEAS TO MAKE UP FOR LOST DEMAND AT HOME. WE HAVE TO STOP THAT RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE TO PREVENT, NOT JUST CHINA, BUT OTHER COUNTRIES FROM MANIPULATING THEIR CURRENCIES TO GAIN AN UNFAIR PRICE IT VANTAGE. I WILL DO THIS -- PRICE ADVANTAGE. I WILL DO THIS, I WILL EXPAND THE WAGE WE RESPOND -- THE WAY WE RESPOND TO CURRENCY MANIPULATION TO INCLUDE DUTIES AND TARIFFS. I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT CHINA. I HAVE SAT ACROSS A LOT OF TABLES FROM CHINESE LEADERS, DISCUSSING AND NEGOTIATING, AND ARGUING ABOUT THE TOUGHEST ISSUES -- NUCLEAR WEAPONS, CYBER WARFARE, HUMAN RIGHTS, CURRENCY, CLIMATE CHANGE, AND MORE. I KNOW FIRSTHAND THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES IS THE MOST COMPLEX AND CONFIDENTIAL IN THE WORLD -- CONSEQUENTIAL IN THE WORLD. THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL NEED THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL NEED TO JUDGMENT AND EXPRESSED TO STEER THAT RELATIONSHIP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, ON TRADE IN EVERYTHING ELSE. -- AND EVERY THING ELSE. WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE DEALS, HERE IS MY STANDARD. I WILL NOT SUPPORT ANY AGREEMENT UNLESS IT HELPS CREATE GOOD JOBS AND HIGHER WAGES FOR AMERICAN WORKERS AND PROTECTS OUR NATIONAL SECURITY.  I NEED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK INTO THE EYES OF ANY HARD-WORKING AMERICAN, ANYWHERE IN OUR COUNTRY AND SAY THIS DEAL WILL HELP READERS YOUR INCOME -- RAISE YOUR INCOME. THAT IS WHY I VOTED AGAINST THE LAST TRADE DEAL CALLED HAVE TO -- CALLED HAVE TO. IT IS WHY I DON'T SUPPORT THE TRANSPACIFIC TRADE DEAL. OUR POLICIES CANNOT JUST BE ABOUT STOPPING TRADE ABUSES AND OUTSOURCING, THEY ALSO HAVE TO BE ABOUT CREATING JOBS, AND HIGHER WAGES HERE AT HOME. I AGREE WITH MY ESTEEMED OPPONENT, SENATOR SANDERS, WE NEED MAJOR NEW INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE. I HAVE PUT FORTH A $275 BILLION PLAN THAT WOULD PUT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO WORK. MODERNIZING OUR WORD -- ROADS, BRIDGES, RAILWAYS, AIRPORTS. FINISH THE JOB OF COME -- CONNECTING ALL AMERICAN HOMES TO HIGH-SPEED INTERNET.  AND WE WILL ALSO REBUILD OUR CRUMBLING WATER SYSTEMS IN FLINT AND AROUND THE COUNTRY.  I ALSO WANT TO CREATE A NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE BANK TO PUT PRIVATE CAPITAL TO WORK ALONGSIDE TAXPAYER DOLLARS. WE HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE NEED EVERYBODY CONTRIBUTED. -- COUNTRY BEATING -- CONTRIBUTING. THE LONGER WE WAIT TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE, THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT GETS.  BUT IF WE START TODAY, WE CAN CREATE GOOD PAYING JOBS THAT CANNOT BE OUTSOURCED. WE CAN BECOME THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF THE 21ST CENTURY. AND WE CAN PROTECT OUR KIDS HEALTH AND FUTURES IN THE BARGAIN. SO FAR SO GOOD, BUT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. WE NEED TO INVEST IN DYNAMIC SOURCES OF GROWTH LIKE SMALL BUSINESSES, MANUFACTURING, AND TECHNOLOGY. I AM THE ONLY CANDIDATE ON EITHER SIDE IN THIS RACE WHO IS ACTUALLY -- HAS ACTUALLY PUT FORWARD A PLAN TO ENDORSE ENTREPRENEURS AND REMOVE THE BARRIERS THAT STAND IN THEIR WAY.  YOU KNOW YOU SEE THE POWER OF SMALL BUSINESSES RIGHT HERE IN MICHIGAN WITH COMPANIES LIKE DETROIT BIKES AND MCCLURG PICKLES. THEY CREATE JOBS, THEY MAKE THE CITY A DYNAMIC, ATTRACTIVE PLACE. THE SAD TRUTH IS, MORE DREAMS DIE IN THE PARKING LOT THE BANKS THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN AMERICA. PEOPLE COME WITH A GOOD IDEA, AND THEY GET TURNED AWAY. WE HAVE TO INCREASE ACCESS TO START UP CAPITAL. GET MORE HELP TO COMMUNITY BANKS SO MORE ENTREPRENEURS CAN GET THEIR DREAMS OFF THE GROUND, AND COMPETE FOR YOUR BUSINESS. ONE IMPORTANT TOOL TO SUPPORT BOTH SMALL AND BIG BUSINESS IS THE EXPORT, IMPORT BANK WHICH HELPS BUSINESSES REACH NEW MARKETS AND COMPETE FOR NEW CUSTOMERS. UNFORTUNATELY REPUBLICAN IN CONGRESS, ALONG WITH SENATOR SANDERS HAVE TRIED TO KILL IT REPEATEDLY. HE ALSO STOOD WITH REPUBLICANS AGAINST ANOTHER IMPORTANT JOB CREATING TOOL, THE NEW MARKET TAX CREDIT. THAT HAS HELPED STEER INVESTMENTS INTO NEGLECTED COMMUNITIES. THAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ME. WE SHOULD NEVER LET IDEOLOGICAL -- IDEOLOGY GET IN THE WAY OF AMERICANS FIGHTING GOOD JOBS THEY NEED AND DESERVE.  SO I THINK YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT HAS TO OFFER A SERIOUS PROPOSAL TO JUMPSTART MANUFACTURING. WITH THE RIGHT POLICIES AND INVESTMENTS WE CAN ENSURE AMERICA CONTINUES TO HAVE THE WORLD'S MOST COMPETITIVE AUTO AND AUTO PARTS INDUSTRY. THIS IS NOT A NEW FIGHT FOR ME. IN THE SENATE, WHERE I REPRESENTED NEW YORK, I ALSO REPRESENTED SOME GREAT MANUFACTURING TOWNS LIKE ROCHESTER AND BUFFALO. I WORKED CLOSELY WITH LIKE-MINDED SENATORS LIKE DEBBIE STEVAN A. WE REACHED ACROSS THE AISLE TO START BIPARTISAN MANUFACTURING CAUCUS. THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR ME. TO HELP OUR MANUFACTURERS USE ALL OF THE LATEST SCIENCE TO FORGE STRONGER STEEL AND WE'VE TOUGHER -- WEAVE TOUGHER FABRIC. AND MAKE STRONGER CLASS. --GLASS. I REMEMBER HOW HARD I HAD TO WORK TO PROTECT JOBS AGAINST CHINA. WE HAD TO BATTLE THE CHINESE AGAINST INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND FAIR COMPETITION. WE HAD TO BATTLE THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DIRECTLY GO TO BAT FOR A BLUE-CHIP AMERICAN COMPANY, BUT IT WAS WITH HER -- IT WAS WORTH IT. COMPANIES LIKE CORNING SHOW HOW TREND -- TECHNOLOGY CAN TRANSFER THE ECONOMY FOR THE BETTER. THAT CREATES ENTIRELY NEW INDUSTRY. IT IS A POWERFUL FORCE FOR PROSPERITY AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE. THE NEXT 20 YEARS ARE POISED TO BE EVEN MORE TRANSFORMATIVE THAN THE LAST. I THINK IT IS EXCITING. YOU CAN SEE THAT OLIVER MICHIGAN. -- ALL OVER MICHIGAN. IN ANN ARBOR AND OTHER PLACES. YOU CANNOT HAVE A CANDID CONVERSATION ABOUT THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE WITHOUT ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES POSED BY TECHNOLOGY, AUTOMATION, AND MECHANIZATION. WE HAVE -- THIS TECHNOLOGY IS A FORCE FOR GOOD, FOR ALL OF US. AS WE LADY FOUNDATION FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE, WE HAVE TO LOOK YIELD WITH THE LEGACY OF THE PAST -- WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE LEGACY OF THE PAST. THERE ARE TOO MANY ECONOMIC BARRIERS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY HOLD BACK COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SEGREGATION IN SCHOOL, A HUGE OPPORTUNITY GAP. WE NEED A CONFERENCE OF COMMITMENT TO INVEST IN ALL COMMUNITIES, ANYWHERE THAT HAVE TWO LONG BEEN NEGLECTED -- TOO LONG BEEN NEGLECTED. LET'S WORK TO REPLACE THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE WITH A CRADLE TO COLLEGE PIPELINE.  LET'S HELP THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE COMING HOME FROM PRISON EVERY YEAR FIND NEW JOBS, NOT CLOSED DOORS.  I WANT TO WORK ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. NOT ONLY IN URBAN COMMUNITIES, BUT IN COLD COUNTRY -- COAL COUNTRY, INDIAN COUNTRY, I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO HELP IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN THE SHADOWS. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE -- CREATING GOOD PAYING JOBS HAVE TO BE A TOP PRIORITY. WE HAVE TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE THE PRESIDENT OBAMA -- MADE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA. AS WE LEARNED THIS MORNING, MORE THAN 242,000 JOBS JUST LAST MONTH.  BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I AM NOT TAKING THAT FOR GRANTED. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE MUCH MORE IN THE PIPELINE SO THAT EVERY AMERICAN HAS A CHANCE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU WE CANNOT DO THIS. AS I SAID IN THE 90'S, WE MADE INCOMES RISE FOR EVERYONE. WE HAVE SEEN THE AUTO INDUSTRY PULL TOGETHER AND RECOVER FROM THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE TO RECORD SALES. WE HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE. I WILL TELL YOU, WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHO SPEND ALL OF THEIR TIME BADMOUTHING AMERICA, IT REALLY UPSETS ME. YOU KNOW WHAT, WE HAVE WORK TO DO. INSTEAD OF COMPLAINING, LET'S JOIN HANDS, LIFT OURSELVES UP. LET'S MAKE A DIFFERENCE. LET'S BUILD TOMORROW. LET'S MAKE SURE EVERY AMERICAN HAS A EIGHTH -- HAS THE SAME CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER DOG GIVEN POTENTIAL. -- GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. HANK YOU. -- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

SHE TALKED ABOUT IT IN MIAMI. THIS IS HAPPENED OUR. -- THIS IS HAPPENED AND OUR. SENATOR CLINTON: THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH. WHAT A SUPER TUESDAY. YOU KNOW, ALL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY  TODAY, DEMOCRATS VOTED TO BREAK DOWN BARRIERS SO WE CAN ALL RISE TOGETHER.   I AM SO DELIGHTED TO BE HERE WITH YOU IN FLORIDA.   I CONGRATULATE SENATOR SANDERS ON HIS STRONG SHOWING AND CAMPAIGNING. I AM GRATEFUL TO ALL OF YOU WHO VOTED FOR ME. THE VOLUNTEERS AND ORGANIZERS. I KNOW YOU HAVE WORKED YOUR HEARTS OUT.  AND TO ALL MY FRIENDS, MANY OF A LIFETIME THAT HAVE TRAVELED TO ALL THE STATES TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THE CANDIDATE THEY KNEW.  AND TO THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WENT TO HILLARY CLINTON.COM, TO GIVE WHAT THEY COULD.  MOST LESS THAN $100.   NOW THIS CAMPAIGN MOVES FORWARD TO THE CRESCENT CITY, THE MOTOR CITY, AND BEYOND.  SENATOR CLINTON WE ARE GOING TO : WORK FOR EVERY VOTE, AND WE WILL NEED ALL OF YOU TO KEEP VOLUNTEERING, CONTRIBUTING,  DOING EVERYTHING YOU CAN.  TALKING TO YOUR FRIENDS AND  NEIGHBORS. BECAUSE THIS COUNTRY BELONGS TO ALL OF US, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP.  NOT JUST THE PEOPLE THAT LOOK ONE WAY, WORSHIP ONE WAY, OR EVEN THINK ONE WAY.   AMERICA  PROSPERS WHEN WE ALL PROSPER.  AMERICA IS STRONG WHEN WE ARE ALL STRONG.   AND WE KNOW WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO. BUT THAT WORK -- THAT WORK IS NOT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AMERICA NEVER STOPPED BEING GREAT.   WE HAVE TO MAKE AMERICA WHOLE.  WE HAVE TO FILL IN WHAT HAS BEEN HOLLOWED OUT. [CHANTING  NO, WE HAVE TO MAKE STRONG THE BROKEN PLACES,  RESTITCH THE BONDS OF TRUST AND RESPECT ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. IT MIGHT BE UNUSUAL, AS I HAVE  SAID BEFORE, FOR A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TO SAY THIS, BUT I'M GOING TO KEEP SAYING IT -- I BELIEVE WHAT WE NEED IN AMERICA TODAY IS MORE LOVE AND KINDNESS.   BECUASE YOU KNOW WHAT?  IT WORKS.  INSTEAD OF BUILDING WALLS, WE  ARE GOING TO BREAK BARRIERS--   AND BUILD LADDERS  OF OPPORTUNITY AND EMPOWERMENT SO EVERY AMERICAN CAN LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER POTENTIAL. BECAUSE THEN AND ONLY THEN CAN AMERICA LIVE UP TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL.   NOW, IT IS CLEAR TONIGHT THAT THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. AND THE RHETORIC WE ARE HEARING ON THE OTHER SIDE HAS NEVER BEEN LOWER.   TRYING TO DIVIDE AMERICA BETWEEN US AND THEM IS  WRONG. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT WORK.   WHETHER WE LIKE IT  OR NOT, WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER, MY FRIENDS.   AND WE ALL HAVE TO  DO OUR PART. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, TO MANY OF  THOSE WITH THE MOST WEALTH AND POWER IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY, SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT BASIC TRUTH ABOUT AMERICA. YESTERDAY I WAS IN THE OLD SOUTH MEETING HOUSE IN BOSTON, WHERE NEARLY 2.5 CENTURIES AGO, AMERICAN PATRIOTS ORGANIZED THE ORIGINAL TEA PARTY. AND I HAD TO WONDER WHAT THEY  WOULD MAKE OF CORPORATIONS THAT  SEEM TO HAVE NO LOYALTY TO THE  COUNTRY THAT GAVE THEM SO MUCH.  WHAT WOULD THEY SAY ABOUT  STUDENT LOAN COMPANIES THAT  OVERCHARGE YOUNG PEOPLE  STRUGGLING TO GET OUT OF DEBT?   EVEN YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN SERVING OUR COUNTRY IN THE MILITARY.  OR CORPORATIONS THAT SHIP THEIR HEADQUARTERS OVERSEAS TO AVOID PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES.   LIKE JOHNSON CONTROLS, AN AUTO-PARTS  COMPANIES FROM WISCONSIN, THAT ALL OF US, WE TAXPAYERS HOPE TO BAILOUT --TAXPAYERS HELPED TO  BAIL OUT IN THE AUTO WRECKS THE 2008, NOW THEY ARE TURNING THEIR BACKS ON AMERICA.   NOW, I AM NOT INTERESTED IN CONDEMNING WHOLE CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE BUSINESSES. I'M JUST INTERESTED IN MAKING THINGS RIGHT. LET THERE BE NO DOUBT, IF YOU CHEAT YOUR EMPLOYEES, EXPLOIT CONSUMERS, POLLUTE OUR ENVIRONMENT, OR RIP OFF THE TAXPAYERS, WE ARE GOING TO HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE.   BUT IF YOU DO THE RIGHT THING, IF YOU INVEST IN  YOUR WORKERS AND IN AMERICA'S FUTURE, THEN WE WILL STAND WITH YOU.  WE ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS HOLDING BACK OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COUNTRY. BECAUSE THE MIDDLE CLASS NEEDS A RAISE.   AND MORE GOOD JOBS. JOBS THAT PAY ENOUGH FOR A FAMILY TO LIVE ON.   EVEN PUT A LITTLE  AWAY FOR RETIREMENT. JOBS THAT PROVIDE DIGNITY AND A BRIGHT FUTURE. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO INVEST IN MANUFACTURING, IN  INFRASTRUCTURE, IN SMALL BUSINESS AND CLEAN ENERGY. ENOUGH CLEAN ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME IN AMERICA.   DON'T LET ANYBODY  TELL YOU WE CAN'T MAKE THINGS IN AMERICA ANYMORE, BECAUSE WE CAN.  WE ARE, AND WE WILL.   AND TOGETHER WE CAN BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS THAT FACE WORKING-CLASS FAMILIES  ACROSS AMERICA. ESPECIALLY IN RUST BELT COMMUNITIES AND SMALL, APPELLATION TOWNS THAT HAVE BEEN HOLLOWED OUT AND LEFT WITHOUT HOPE. THOSE WHO KEPT OUR COUNTRY RUNNING. TOGETHER WE CAN BREAK DOWN BARRIERS SO THEY GET THE EDUCATION THEY NEED AND DESERVE. EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA SHOULD HAVE A GREAT SCHOOL AND A GREAT  TEACHER NO MATTER WHAT ZIP CODE THEY LIVE IN. TOGETHER, WE CAN BREAK DOWN BARRIERS FOR WOMEN AND FINALLY GUARANTEE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK.    AND WE CAN BREAK DOWN BARRIERS FOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE SEEN TOO MANY BLACK CHILDREN HARASSED, HUMILIATED.  WE CAN BREAK DOWN BARRIERS FOR VOTERS IN NORTH CAROLINA WHO HAVE BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY DISENFRANCHISED AND DISEMPOWERED. WE CAN BREAK DOWN BARRIERS FOR HARD-WORKING IMMIGRANTS EVERYWHERE WHO ARE TOO OFTEN EXPLOITED AND INTIMIDATED.   WE HAVE TO DEFEND ALL OF OUR  RIGHTS, WORKERS RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHTS, CIVIL RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS. LGBT RIGHTS AND RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE  WITH DISABILITIES. THAT STARTS BY STANDING WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN HE NOMINATES A STRONG SUPREME JUSTICE TO THE SUPREME COURT.   I KNOW TOO MANY AMERICANS HAVE LOST FAITH IN OUR FUTURE.  WE HEAR IT IN THE VOICES OF  PARENTS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW THEY  ARE GOING TO GIVE THEIR KIDS THE OPPORTUNITIES THEY DESERVE. WE SEE IN THE EYES OF WORKING MEN AND WOMEN WHO DON'T EXPECT  ANYTHING TO COME EASY BUT WONDER WHY IT HAS TO BE QUITE SO HARD. LIKE MANY OF YOU I FIND STRENGTH  AND PURPOSE IN THE VALUES I  LEARNED FROM MY FAMILY AND MY FAITH. THEY GAVE ME SIMPLE WORDS TO LIVE BY.  DO ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN FOR ALL  THE PEOPLE YOU CAN FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN.  THAT IS WHY I BELIEVE THAT IF WE  RESIST THE FORCES TRYING TO  DRIVE US APART WE CAN COME  TOGETHER TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY  WORK FOR EVERYONE, THE STRONG -- THE STRUGGLING, THE STRIVING, AND THE SUCCESSFUL. IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER, WE CAN RESTORE OUR COMMON FAITH IN OUR COMMON FUTURE. THAT IS THE SPIRIT POWERING THIS CAMPAIGN.  IT COMES FROM THE YOUNG JANITOR IN ARKANSAS WHO STOPPED BUYING JUNK FOOD AND PUT OFF BEING A -- GETTING A HAIRCUT TO  CONTRIBUTE TO IT. IT COMES FROM THE DISABLED  COMBAT VETERAN FROM NEBRASKA WHO SENT IN $10. IN 70 YEARS OF HIS LIFE, HE HAD NEVER DONATED TO A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN UNTIL NOW. YOU CAN JOIN US, TOO. PLEASE GO TO HILLARY  CLINTON.COM. TEXT ""JOIN"" TO 47246. LET ME LEAVE YOU WITH A STORY THAT HAS INSPIRED SO MANY OF US. WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN FLINT, MICHIGAN DON'T WE? OUR CITY'S CHILDREN WERE POISONED BY TOXIC WATER BECAUSE THEIR GOVERNOR WANTED TO SAVE A LITTLE MONEY. BUT, THERE IS ANOTHER STORY IN FLINT.  THE STORY OF A COMMUNITY THAT  HAS BEEN KNOCKED DOWN BUT REFUSED TO BE KNOCKED OUT. IT IS HUNDREDS OF UNION PLUMBERS COMING FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO HELP INSTALL NEW WATER SYSTEMS. IT IS STUDENTS SHOWING UP TO  DISTRIBUTE SUPPLIES. IT IS THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS DONATING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO HELP. WHEN I VISITED FLINT A FEW WEEKS AGO I WENT TO THE HOUSE OF PRAYER MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH, THE CONGREGATION LOCKED ARMS AND SAYING. -- AND SAYING. -- THE CONGREGATION LOCKED ARMS AND SANG. WE HAVE COME TOO FAR FROM WHERE  WE STARTED FROM.  THEY ARE NOT ABOUT TO QUIT NOW.  WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY OTHER  FLINTS OUT THERE, COMMUNITIES  THAT NEED HELP.  WE HAVE COME TOO FAR IN THIS  COUNTRY TO LET US TURN BACK.  WE ARE GOING TO BUILD ON THE  PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE.  WE HAVE SAVE THE AUTO INDUSTRY  THANKS TO PRESIDENT OBAMA.  NOW WE HAVE TO CREATE NEW JOBS AND INDUSTRIES OF THE FUTURE.   WE NOW HAVE  INSURED 90% OF  AMERICANS -- WE NEED TO GET TO 100%. WE HAVE COME TOO FAR TO STOP  NOW. WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING.  KEEP WORKING.  KEEP BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS AND IMAGINE WHAT WE CAN BUILD TOGETHER WHEN EACH AND EVERY AMERICAN HAS THE CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL.  THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.    ",Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton Super Tuesday Election Night Speech

HELLO, GEORGE MASON. HELLO! OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH!  OH, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU. I WANT TO THANK MY DEAR FRIEND, YOUR GOVERNOR, FOR NOT ONLY THAT INTRODUCTION BUT THE AMAZING JOB HE'S DOING. IN LEADING VIRGINIA, GETTING  RESULTS. HELPING TO BUILD A STRONG FUTURE. I AM THRILLED TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND A LITTLE  TIME WITH YOU THE DAY BEFORE  THIS IMPORTANT ELECTION. I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD FROM SENATOR KAINE AND BOBBY SCOTT AND JERRY CONNOLLY AND JIM MORAN WHO IS HERE. WE HAVE A GREAT PREPROGRAM ABOUT PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. I WANT TO JUST UNDERSCORE THAT. THERE COULDN'T BE A BIGGER  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT I  BELIEVE WE NEED TO DO TO MOVE OUR COUNTRY FORWARD. AND WHAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE  PROMISING TO DO. WHICH WOULD RIP AWAY THE PROGRESS, SEND US BACKWARDS, DEPRIVE PEOPLE OF RIGHTS THAT THEY HAVE OBTAINED AND GENERALLY MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO HAVE THE KIND OF OPPORTUNITY THAT I KNOW AMERICA DESERVES AND THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE TOGETHER. SO HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW. I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO BREAK DOWN EVERY BARRIER THAT STANDS IN THE WAY OF AMERICA  FULFILLING ITS POTENTIAL. AND I WANT TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE  FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN,  PARTICULARLY YOUNG AMERICANS, TO GO AS FAR AS YOU CAN. YOU KNOW, AMERICA NEVER STOPPED BEING GREAT. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE AMERICA WHOLE. WE PEOPLE TOGETHER, QUIT BEING DIVIDED. I REALLY REGRET THE LANGUAGE  THAT IS BEING USED BY REPUBLICANS, SCAPEGOATING PEOPLE, FINGER POINTING BLAMING. THAT IS NOT HOW WE SHOULD BEHAVE TOWARD ONE ANOTHER. THAT IS NOT HOW WE WANT TO BE  TREATED AND WE'RE GOING TO DEMONSTRATE, STARTING TOMORROW ON SUPER TUESDAY, THERE'S A  DIFFERENT PATH THAT AMERICANS  WANT TO TAKE AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT BECAUSE, FROM  MY PERSPECTIVE, KNOCKING DOWN BARRIERS MEANS WE GET RID OF ALL OF THE CHALLENGES WHETHER THEY  BE ECONOMIC, ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION, THE CONTINUING  BARRIERS OF SYSTEMIC RACISM, PREJUDICE, BIGOTRY, ALL OF THAT, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE  CALLED TO DO AS AMERICANS. AND I AM PROUD OF THE PROGRESS  WE HAVE MADE. I WANT US TO HAVE MORE GOOD JOBS, I REALLY APPLAUD GOVERNOR  McAULIFFE'S RECORD HELPING TO ATTRACT AND CREATE MORE JOB OPPORTUNITIES HERE IN VIRGINIA. WE NEED DO THAT ACROSS THE  NATION, PARTICULARLY WE NEED TO TARGET COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE  BEEN LEFT OUT AND LEFT BEHIND. I AM THE ONLY CANDIDATE RUNNING WHO HAS A PLAN TO IMPROVE THE ECONOMY IN COAL COUNTRY, TO HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT. WE CAN DO THIS BY CREATING JOBS  AND INFRASTRUCTURE, ADVANCE MANUFACTURING, CLEAN RENEWABLE  ENERGY. LET PUT AMERICANS TO WORK AND  JOBS THAT CAN'T BE EXPORTED AND  THAT WE'LL BUILD OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR COUNTRY. AND WITH RESPECT TO CLIMATE  CHANGE, THE REPUBLICANS, WHENEVER ASKED ABOUT IT, THEY  ALL SAY I DON'T KNOW, I'M NOT A  SCIENTIST. THERE'S A VERY EASY ANSWER TO  THAT, GO TALK TO A SCIENTIST LIKE SOMEBODY HERE AT GEORGE  MASON WHO CAN SET YOU STRAIGHT AND GIVE YOU THE FACTS. YOU SEE, I ACTUALLY HAVE  CONCLUDED THAT THEY DON'T  BELIEVE THAT. THEY JUST ARE FOLLOWING ORDERS FROM THE KOCH BROTHERS WHO HAVE  TOLD THEM, DO NOT EVER SAY YOU BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, NOT  ONLY DO WE KNOW IT'S HAPPENING,  WE'RE GOING TO TACKLE IT  TOGETHER. AND ONE OF THE WAYS IS BY BUILDING A NEW ECONOMY WITH  CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY JOBS. I'VE SET TWO BIG GOALS. LET'S DEPLOY HALF A BILLION MORE SOLAR PANELS BY THE END OF MY  FIRST TERM, AND ENOUGH CLEAN  ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME BY  THE END OF MY SECOND TERM. SOME NATION IS GOING TO BE THE 21st CENTURY CLEAN ENERGY  SUPERPOWER. I THINK IT'S EITHER GOING TO BE GERMANY, CHINA OR US. I WANT IT TO BE US. IT CAN BE US. LET'S WORK TO MAKE THAT COME TRUE! WE ALSO HAVE TO DO MORE FOR  SMALL BUSINESS. I WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO FEEL LIKE THEY CAN START A SMALL BUSINESS, HAVE THAT CHANCE TO GROW SOMETHING OF THEIR OWN, AND WE'RE GOING TO DO MORE TO  SUPPORT MINORITY AND WOMEN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES. LET'S GET AROUND TO RAISING THE  FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE  RIGHT NOW IT'S A POVERTY WAGE AND PEOPLE THAT WORK FULL TIME  SHOULD NOT STILL BE IN POVERTY. AND DON'T YOU THINK IT'S FINALLY TIME TO GUARANTEE EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN'S WORK? NOW, EVERYTHING I'VE JUST SAID,  THE REPUBLICANS DON'T AGREE WITH. AND IT'S A REAL SHAME BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW TO CREATE JOBS. BACK IN THE 1990s, WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS PRESIDENT, WE HAD 23 MILLION NEW JOBS. AND INCOMES WENT UP FOR  EVERYBODY, NOT JUST PEOPLE AT THE TOP. EVERYBODY. MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES, WORKING FAMILIES, POOR FAMILIES, AND WE LIFTED MORE PEOPLE OUT OF  POVERTY THAN AT ANY TIME IN RECENT HISTORY. AND HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW. DURING THAT TIME PERIOD, THE  MEDIAN AMERICAN FAMILY IN WENT  UP 17%. AND THE MEDIAN AFRICAN-AMERICAN  FAMILY IN WENT UP 33%. THERE IS NOTHING BETTER THAN A GOOD JOB TO HELP PEOPLE AND  THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN. AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL  THAT YOU PAY ATTENTION AND HELP  OTHER PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO SELL THE SAME SNAKE OIL. THEY WANT TO GO BACK TO TRIMLECKLE  DOWN ECONOMICS. HASN'T WORKED. WON'T WORK. HERE'S HOW WE KNOW IT. WE WENT FROM 1990s WITH ALL OF THE JOBS AND RISING INCOMES TO A NEW REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHO  CAME IN AND WENT BACK TO TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS, SLASHING TAXES,  GETTING THE REGULATORS TO TURN  AWAY FROM REGULATING WALL  STREET, NO LONGER KEEPING AN EYE ON THE MORTGAGE MARKET. AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. YOU KNOW WE HAD ANOTHER, NEW, YOUNG, DYNAMIC DEMOCRATIC  PRESIDENT COME IN AND WAS HAND HANDED -- HE WAS HANDED THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. YOU KNOW AFTER THAT '08 ELECTION, PRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA CALLED, ASKED ME TO SEE HIM IN CHICAGO. I DIDN'T KNOW WHY. HE JUST LOOKED AT ME AND SAID,  IT IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN THEY  TOLD US, AND IT WAS. WE WERE LOSING 800,000 JOBS A  MONTH. 9 MILLION AMERICANS LOST THEIR JOBS. 5 MILLION HOMES WERE LOST. AND 13 TRILLION DOLLARS IN FAMILY WEALTH WAS WIPED OUT. I DON'T THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA  GETS THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR  DIGGING US OUT OF THE DITCH THAT THE REPUBLICANS PUT US INTO. SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT DEBATE ABOUT THE ECONOMY IN THE  GENERAL ELECTION, IF I'M SO FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE THE NOMINEE. AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET THEM FORGET FORGET. WE'LL TALK A LOT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT'S AT STAKE. WE'LL ALSO TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE. BECAUSE I WILL DEFEND THE  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH HAS HELPED 19 MILLION AMERICANS GET  ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. WE ARE AT 90% UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE. WE HAVE 10% TO GO. THE REPUBLICANS KEEP TRYING TO REPEAL IT. 63 TIMES THEY HAVE VOTED TO  REPEAL IT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY WON'T TELL YOU WHAT THEY  WANT TO PUT IN ITS PLACE. THEY WON'T TELL YOU BECAUSE IF  THEY DO, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO  LIKE IT BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST  GOING TO HAND IT BACK TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WHERE WE WERE,  BECAUSE REMEMBER, BEFORE THERE  WAS SOMETHING CALLED OBAMACARE, THERE WAS SOMETHING CALLED HILLARYCARE, BECAUSE I WAS  TRYING TO GET TO UNIVERSAL  HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. AND YOU KNOW, THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, DRUG COMPANIES, GHEET US THAT TIME. AND I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED  BECAUSE I KNEW WHAT WAS  HAPPENING TO SO MANY AMERICAN  FAMILIES WHO COULD NOT AFFORD  HEALTH INSURANCE. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT WAS -- IT WAS SO UNFAIR. I'LL TELL YOU ONE QUICK STORY. I WAS AT THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN CLEVELAND, I WAS MEETING WITH PARENTS OF REALLY SICK KIDS. THOSE KIDS HAD PREEXISTINGEN CANS, THEY COULDN'T GET HEALTH INSURANCE AND PARENTS WERE  TELLING ME WHAT AN INCREDIBLE BURDEN, THEY WERE MORTGAGING  HOUSES, GOING INTO DEBT, TAKING  BANKRUPTCY TO TRY TO HELP THEIR  CHILD TO SAVE A LIFE, TO GIVE THEM QUALITY OF LIFE, AND YOU KNOW, ONE MAN SAID, LOOK, I'M SUCCESSFUL, I HAVE A BUSINESS, I PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE TO MY  EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES, AND NOBODY WILL SELL ME ANY KIND OF POLICY. I SAID, WHAT DO THEY TELL YOU? HE SAID, I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS. I SIT DOWN WITH THEM, SHOW THEM  MY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SHOW  THEM THE MEDICAL COSTS, I ASK  THEM FOR SOME HELP. HE SAID THE LAST TIME I MET WITH ONE OF THE COMPANIES, THE REP LOOKS AT ALL OF THAT, AND THEN  HE SAID TO ME YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, WE DON'T INSURE  BURNING HOUSES. TO THE FATHER SAYS TO ME, WITH  TEARS IF HIS EYES, THEY CALLED  MY LITTLE GIRLS BURNING HOUSES. I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT  BECAUSE ONE OF THE REASONS I  WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TO CREATE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE  PROGRAM WHICH INSURES 8 MILLION  KIDS NOW, WAS AT LEAST TO TRY TO HELP KIDS LIKE THAT GET SOME MEDICAL CARE AND GIVE THEIR  FAMILIES SOME PEACE OF MIND. THAT'S WHY I WAS THRILLED WHEN  THE PRESIDENT PASSED AND SIGNED  THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND I'M GO TO DO EVERYTHING I  CAN TO DEFEND IT AGAINST THE REPUBLICANS, TO IMPROVE IT, TO GET THE COSTS DOWN, AND TO MAKE IT WORK BETTER. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WE'RE  GOING TO GO AFTER THE DRUG COMPANIES THAT ARE INCREASING THE COSTS OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG SS. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS THAT STAND IN THE WAY  OF EDUCATION. EDUCATION FOR EVERY CHILD, REGARDLESS OF YOUR ZIP CODE. THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL UNFAIRNESS WE STILL HAVE TO OVERCOME IN  AMERICA. IF YOU'RE FROM A POOR COMMUNITY, YOU'RE LIKELY NOT TO HAVE THE  RESOURCES YOU NEED FOR THE KIND OF EDUCATION YOU DESERVE. AT SOME POINT, WE HAVE TO  ACKNOWLEDGE WE ARE SHORT  CHANGING MILLIONS OF KIDS. BEFORE THEY EVER GET TO BE 8,  10, 12, THEY ARE BEHIND. SO LET'S DO THIS, LET'S HAVE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SO WE  GET MORE KIDS READY TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND THEN LET'S MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AGAIN. I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO GO TO ANY PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY DEBT-FREE. YOU WON'T HAVE TO BORROW A PENNY TO PAY FOR TUITION. AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THE COSTS DOWN. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO WORK WITH STATES, LIKE THIS ONE, WHERE THE GOVERNOR JUST SAID HE GOOD A  BILLION MORE FOR EDUCATION. WE NEED STATES STARTING TO PUT BACK MONEY INTO HIGHER EDUCATION. WE HAVE ENOUGH PRISONS. WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE PRISONS. WOO NEED INVESTMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTEAD. AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO TACKLE  THE DEBT PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE WHO  ALREADY HAVE DEBT. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE STUDENT DEBT? I'M NOT SURPRISED. I'M NOT SURPRISED. ANYBODY HERE HAVE AN INTEREST RATE HIGHER THAN 10%? 11%. HIGHER THAN 11. 12%. I FEEL LIKE I'M IN AN AUCTION. 14%. OKAY. I WANT EVERYBODY TO JUST LISTEN  TO THAT. WE HAVEN'T HAD INTEREST RATES THAT HIGH FOR ANYTHING BESIDES  STUDENT DEBT. YOU CAN REFINANCE YOUR CAR. YOU CAN REFINANCE YOUR HOME. CORPORATIONS CAN REFINANCE THEIR DEBT. AND WE ARE SADDLING YOUNG PEOPLE TRYING TO GET THEIR EDUCATION  WITH THESE DEBTS AND AN INTEREST RATE THAT IS AS HIGH AS 14%. PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO GO TO SCHOOL BECAUSE IF THEY BORROW MONEY, THEY'LL NEVER GET OUT FROM UNDER THE DEBT. SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. WE'RE GOING TO REFINANCE ALL OF  THIS DEBT. GET THE INTEREST RATES DOWN AS  LOW AS THEY ARE FOR EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE ECONOMY. AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE  PEOPLE INTO INCOME REPAYMENT  PLANS, LIKE I HAD AND MY HUSBAND HAD. WE GRADUATED WITH DEBT FROM LAW SCHOOL BUT WE WERE IN A PLAN AS WE PAID IT BACK AS A PERCENTAGE  OF OUR INCOME. I WANT EVERY YOUNG PERSON TO HAVE THAT SAME OPTION. AND IF YOU DO PUBLIC SERVICE,  NATIONAL SERVICE, WE WILL CUT IT, DISCOUNT IT, EVEN FORGIVE IT AT A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME. AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT A DEADLINE, IF YOU PAY YOUR DEBT  BACK EVERY MONTH, FAITHFULLY AT THE END OF 20 YEARS, IT DOESN'T  MATTER HOW MUCH IS LEFT, YOU'RE  DONE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE YOU CARRYING THAT DEBT AROUND. AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAKE MONEY  OFF OF LENDING MONEY TO YOUNG PEOPLE. IT SHOULD BE AN INVESTMENT WE  MAKE, NOT A MONEY MAKING PROPOSITION PROPOSITION. I DO HAVE A DISAGREEMENT WITH MY ESTEEMED OPPONENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY BECAUSE HE  WANTS TO GIVE EVERYBODY FREE COLLEGE AND THERE'S TWO PROBLEMS WITH THAT. ONE IS, THAT DOES NOTHING TO GET THE COST DONE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GUARANTEE A FREE MONEY, THERE'S  NO REASON TO TRY GET THE COSTS  DOWN. THE OTHER PROBLEM IS PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD, UPPER CLASS, RICH PEOPLE, THEY SHOULD PAY. I I AM NOT GOING TO TAX YOU AND  YOUR FAMILY TO SEND DONALD TRUMP'S YOUNGEST CHILD TO COLLEGE FOR FREE. SO WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO. AND THERE'S MORE EXCITING OPPORTUNITIES TO KNOCK DOWN BARRIERS. BUT LET'S THINK FOR A MINUTE  ABOUT WHERE WE DISAGREE WITH THE REPUBLICANS ON WHAT THEY SAY  ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS AND VOTING RIGHTS AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND GAY RIGHTS AND WORKERS RIGHTS. THEY SEEM TO BE AGAINST THEM  ALL. HERE'S WHERE I STAND. I SUPPORT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO  MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS ABOUT HEALTH CARE. I WILL DEFEND PLANNED PARENTHOOD AGAINST THESE PARTISAN REPUBLICAN ATTACKS. I WILL DEFEND MARRIAGE EQUALITY  AND WORK TO END DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY. I WILL DEFEND VOTING RIGHTS AGAINST ALL OF THE EFFORTS TO  MAKE IT HARDER AND HARDER FOR  PEOPLE TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT  TO VOTE. I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO  END CITIZENS UNITED, ONE OF 0 THE WORST DECISIONS THAT HAS EVER BEEN DECIDED. AND I APPLAUD PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR FULFILLING HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES TO ACTUALLY NOMINATE A SUPREME  COURT JUSTICE. AND NOW, I THINK WE HAVE TO DEFEND DEFENDDE DEMAND THAT THE SENATE FULLFILL ITS CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES. I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FOR A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP. I WILL DEFEND SOCIAL SECURITY AGAINST THE REPUBLICAN SCHEMES  TO PRIVATIZE IT AND TURN THE TRUST FUND OVER TO WALL STREET, THE WORST IDEA EVER! I WILL STAND UPPER TO THE SIMPLE PROPOSITION THAT THE WEALTHY IN THIS COUNTRY NEED TO PAY THEIR  FAIR SHARE IN THE TAX SYSTEM. AND WHEN A COMPANY OR AN INDIVIDUAL PULLS ALL OF THE  GAMES AND GIMMICKS IN ORDER TO AVOID PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE, WE'RE GOING TO CRACK DOWN ON  THAT. I'LL GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE. A COMPANY CALLED JOHNSON  CONTROLS, BASED IN WISCONSIN, IT MAKES AUTO PARTS. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS PRESIDENT  OBAMA FACED IN '09 WAS THE POTENTIAL COLLAPSE OF THE AUTO  INDUSTRY, AND THE AUTO COMPANIES, PARTS COMPANIES, THEY CAME TO WASHINGTON, THEY ASKED  FOR HELP. THE REPUBLICANS SAID LET THEM  DIE, TAKE MILLIONS OF BE. S, LET IT GO. THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEMOCRATS SAID NO, WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP. THEY GAVE THEM A BAILOUT. TURNED OUT TO BE A GOOD DEAL FOR US, THEY PAID IT BACK, EVEN  FASTER THAN EXPECTED. BUT HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW. ONE OF THE COMPANIES ASKING FOR  HELP AND GETTING HELP WAS  JOHNSON CONTROLS. SO YOU, I, EVERYBODY ELSE IN  AMERICA WE KEPT THAT COMPANY  ALIVE. IT TURNED THE CORNER, BECAME SUCCESSFUL. WHAT DID THEY JUST ANNOUNCE LAST MONTH? THEY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO PROTENDGO  ING TO PRETEND TO SELL  THEMSELVES TO A SMALLER COMPANY  IN EUROPE, PRETEND TO MOVE THEIR HEADQUARTERED TO EUROPE SO THAT  THEY CAN AVOID PAYING TAXES TO  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY THAT SAVED THEM. NOW, IN THE TAX LAW THAT'S  CALLED AN INVERSION. I CALL IT A PERVERSION. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THAT CONTINUE. WE'RE GOING RIGHT AT IT. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THEM PAY A PRICE FOR THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR  BECAUSE IT'S WRONG AND IT REALLY DOES SEND A MESSAGE, HEY, BIG COMPANIES, BILLIONAIRES CAN DO  WHATEVER THEY WANT. SO WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO TO FIX  THE TAX CODE, TO MAKE IT FAIRER. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS, I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE, ON EITHER SIDE, WHO HAS SAID I'M GOING TO DO WHAT I CAN TO RAISE YOUR INCOMES. I WILL NOT RAISE MIDDLE CLASS TAXES. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN ON MY WATCH. NOW I ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU THAT I, LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE, AM SICK OF LOOKING ON THE INTERNET,  TURNING ON THE NEWS, SEE ANOTHER MASS KILLING IN AMERICA. ON AVERAGE 90 PEOPLE A DAY ARE KILLED BY GUNS. THAT'S 33,000 PEOPLE A YEAR. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE REALLY POWERFUL LOBBIES IN WASHINGTON,  THEY TALK ABOUT WALL STREET AND DRUGS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES  AND BIG OIL. THE MOST POWERFUL IS THE GUN  LOBBY. AND IT'S TIME WE ALL STOOD UP TO THEM. AND WORK TO ACHIEVE -- WORK TO ACHIEVE COMMON SENSE GUN REFORM MEASURES. WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS. WE NEED TO CLOSE THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE AND THE ONLINE  LOOPHOLE, CLOSE WHAT'S CALLED  THE CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE. THAT'S SOMETHING YOU MAY NOT  KNOW ENABLED THE KILLER IN CHARLESTON TO GET THE GUN THAT  HE WENT TO BUY BECAUSE, UNFORTUNATELY, THERE UNITED  STATES A LOOPHOLE THAT SAYS AT  THE END OF THREE DAYS, WHETHER  OR NOT THEY HAVE THE  INFORMATION, YOU GET TO BUY THE GUN, AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS YOUNG MAN IS THAT THEY FOUND OUT ONLY LATER HE SHOULDN'T HAVE  BEEN ABLE TO BUY THE GUN BECAUSE HE HAD A RECORD. BUT HE TOOK THAT GUN, WENT TO THE MOTHER EMMANUEL CHURCH IN CHARLESTON, WALKED IN TO BIBLE  STUDY, AND HE WAS WELCOMED. YOU KNOW, THOSE OF US WHO ARE PEOPLE OF FAITH, WE KNOW, YOU'RE CALLED TO WELCOME THE STRANGER. HE WAS WELCOMED. HE SAT DOWN IN THAT BIBLE STUDY. HE LISTENED TO THOSE FAITHFUL PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE BIBLE. AND THEN ABOUT AN HOUR LATER HE  STOOD UP AND MURDERED NINE OF THEM. IF WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESPECT THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS BUT KEEP GUNS OUT OF PEOPLE WHO  HAVE FELONY RECORDS WHO ARE FUGITIVES, STALKERS, HAVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING  ORDERS AGAINST THEM, ARE DANGEROUSLY MENTALLY ILL, SHAME  ON US. AND HERE'S THE WORST EXAMPLE OF  THE OVERREACH BY THE GUN LOBBY. SOMETHING CALLED THE NO FLY  LIST. YOU GET ON IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE  SOME CONNECTION TO TERRORISTS OR TERRORISM. SO THE GUN LOBBY WON'T EVEN LET THE CONGRESS PASS A LAW PROHIBITING PEOPLE ON THE NO FLY LIST FROM BUYING A GUN. WHAT IS IT ABOUT BEING A TERRORIST THAT GIVES YOU SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS THAT CAN BE EXERCISED POTENTIALLY BY  SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO DO HARM TO AMERICANS? 92% OF AMERICANS AGREE WITH WHAT I'M PROPOSING. 85% OF AMERICAN GUN OWNERS AGREE WITH WHAT I'M PROPOSING. NOW, I WANT TO KNOCK DOWN THESE BARRIERS. I WANT TO LIFT PEOPLE UP. CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITY. BUT I CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOUR HELP. I NEED YOUR HELP TOMORROW. I HOPE EVERYONE WILL TURN OUT  AND VOTE IN THE VIRGINIA PRIMARY PRIMARY. AND HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW. IF YOU GO OUT AND VOTE FOR ME TOMORROW, I WILL STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR YOU THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN NO MATTER WHO THE REPUBLICANS NOMINATE. IN FACT, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU,  I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THOSE DEBATES BECAUSE AT SOME POINT  YOU CAN'T JUST SAY WHATEVER POPS INTO YOUR HEAD IF YOU WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF 0 THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ACTUALLY LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT SAY. AND YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO DEFEAT ISIS. I AM PROUD OF THE UNITED STATES  MILITARY AND I'M PROUD OF  VIRGINIA, WHICH IS THE HOME TO  SO  MANY ACTIVE DUTY MEMBERS AND VETERANS. AND I KNOW WE'VE GOT TO DEFEAT THE TERRORISTS' THREAT. I'VE LAID OUT A PLAN TO DO THAT. BUT PART OF IT REQUIRES BUILDING COALITIONS WITH MUSLIM NATIONS  BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO GO AFTER IT, AN AIR COALITION LED BY THE U.S., ISIS, THEIR  INFRASTRUCTURE, THEIR LEADERSHIP, FROM THE AIR. BUT WE'VE GOT TO SUPPORT ARAB  AND KURDISH FIGHTERS WILLING TO  TAKE TERRITORY BACK PHYSICALLY. WE'VE GOT TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE IRAQI ARMY, NOW THAT WE FINALLY HAVE A CEASE-FIRE IN  SYRIA, WE'VE GOT TO WORK TO HOLD IT. WHILE WE HAVE IT, TURN PEOPLE'S  ATTENTION TOWARD ISIS AND THE  OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS. JUST IMAGINE, I BUILT THE COALITION THAT TOOK ON THE  SANCTIONS TO IMPOSE ON IRAN, PUT IT TOGETHER, INCLUDING CHINA AND RUSSIA. I KNOW HOW HARD IT'S BEEN. I KNOW WE'VE GOT TO DO THE SAME TO DEFEAT ALL OF THE TERRORIST  GROUPS FROM NORTH AFRICA TO SOUTH ASIA. SO, WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHO IS INSULTING PEOPLE, INSULTING THEIR RELIGION, I'LL TELL YOU,  THAT MAKES A HARD JOB EVEN HARDER. AND SO WE'VE GOT TO PAY  ATTENTION TO WHAT IS SAID BECAUSE EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD PAYS ATTENTION. AND IT HAS CONSEQUENCES. IN A CAMPAIGN, AND MOST  SERIOUSLY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WHEN YOU GO TO VOTE TOMORROW,  YOU'LL BE VOTING FOR A PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF, RIGHT? AND WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO HAS THE EXPERIENCE AND THE TEMPERAMENT TO DEAL WITH WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD. AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE  EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN THAT SITUATION ROOM, DECISIONS DON'T GET THERE UNLESS THEY NEED THE PRESIDENT TO  DECIDE THEM. JUST LIKE WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER TO BASE ANY  ACTION OFF OF THE INTELLIGENCE WHERE BIN LADEN WAS. THESE ARE HARD CHOICES. SO WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE  THINK HARD ABOUT WHO CAN FULFILL THAT ESSENTIAL PART OF THE JOB. SO HERE'S WHAT I'M ASKING YOU. IF YOU WILL STAND WITH ME TOMORROW, IF YOU WILL STAND WITH ME DURING THIS CAMPAIGN, AND THEN, THEN IF YOU WILL WORK WITH ME TO ACHIEVE THIS MISSION I HAVE LAID OUT OF KNOCKING DOWN THESE BARRIERS, OF CREATING  OPPORTUNITIES, OF GIVING EVERY  SINGLE PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY  NOT JUST THE FEELING BUT THE REALITY THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL  BEFORE THE LAW, THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO FIX THE CRIMINAL  JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THE INCARCERATION SYSTEM. THAT WE ALL HAVE POTENTIAL, THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO DEAL  WITH JOBS AND HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION, THAT WE ALL HAVE RIGHTS, THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO DEFEND THE RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE, IF YOU WILL STAND WITH ME, I TRULY BELIEVE AMERICA'S BEST YEARS ARE STILL AHEAD OF US. SO LET'S GO OUT AND MAKE THAT  COME TRUE! THANK YOU ALL SO VERY, VERY MUCH!                      >",Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally in Virginia
54,2016-02-26,http://www.c-span.org/video/?405395-1/hillary-clinton-campaign-rally-orangeburg-south-carolina,"[u'unidentified speaker', u'unidentified speaker', u'sec. clinton', u'unidentified speaker']",Clinton,"  HELLO, SOUTH CAROLINA'S DATE. I AM SO -- SOUTH CAROLINA STATES. I AM SO GRATEFUL TO BE HERE AND TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION AND I WANT TO THANK CONGRESSMAN CLYBURN FOR BEING HERE WITH ME. FOR HIS SUPPORT AND HIS GUIDANCE . IF I AM SO FORTUNATE TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT, I AM GOING TO BE COUNTING ON CONGRESSMAN CLYBURN TO HELP ME MAKE THE CHANGES THAT WE NEED IN WASHINGTON. IT IS ALWAYS A SPECIAL TREAT TO HAVE MRS. CLYBURN HERE AS WELL. THANK YOU EMILY FOR BEING WITH US THIS AFTERNOON. YOU KNOW, WHEN I THINK ABOUT THIS ELECTION, I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS ONE OF THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL WE HAVE HAD BECAUSE THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THERE IS A BIG DIVIDE BETWEEN WHAT I BELIEVE, WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA BELIEVES, WHAT CONGRESSMAN CLYBURN BELIEVES AND THOUGH MANY OTHERS AND WHAT YOU ARE HEARING FROM THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. THAT IS WHY GETTING INVOLVED IS NOT ONLY A GOOD THING TO DO, IT IS ESSENTIAL. I WANT TO MAKE A FEW POINTS TO YOU ABOUT WHY I BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE INVOLVED THIS TIME BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE ISSUES, THEIR PROBLEMS, THE CONCERNS THAT I HEAR FROM YOUNG PEOPLE WILL EITHER BE ADDRESSED OR THEIR -- OR THEY WILL BE IGNORED. LET ME START WITH THE ECONOMY. I HAPPEN TO THINK THAT WE HAVE GOT TO CREATE MORE GOOD PAYING JOBS, WE HAVE GOT TO RAISE INCOME, WE HAVE TO GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE CHANCES TO START MALL BUSINESSES, TO BE ENTREPRENEURS, TO START -- TO CHART THEIR OWN FUTURE. THAT IS WHY I HAVE PUT FORTH PLANS ON HOW WE CAN CREATE MORE JOBS IN MANUFACTURING, INFRASTRUCTURE, IN CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY. WE CAN DO THAT IF WE SET OUR MINDS TO IT. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE MORE ACCESS TO CREDIT AND MORE SUPPORT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. EVERYWHERE I GO, CAN PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE A GREAT IDEA THAT THEY ARE BURDENED BY DEBT AND THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO GET THE CREDIT THEY NEED. WE HAVE GOT TO FIX IT AND I HAVE A PLAN. WE ALSO HAVE TO RAISE MINIMUM WAGE. PEOPLE WHO WORK FULL-TIME SHOULD NOT BE MIRED IN POVERTY AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IT IS WAY PAST TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WOMEN GET EQUAL PAY FOR THE WORK WE DO IN THE WORKPLACE. EVERYTHING I HAVE JUST SAID, THE REPUBLIC INNS DO NOT AGREE WITH. THEY DO NOT BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER TO INVEST MORE IN NEW JOBS. THEY SAY, LEAVE IT TO THE MARKET. THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE. THEY DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH EQUAL PAY. THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES IN THIS ELECTION AND THEY WILL TRY TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT THERE PHILOSOPHY OF TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS IS WHAT FOLKS SHOULD VOTE FOR. LET ME MAKE TWO HISTORICAL OBSERVATIONS. WE WERE ON THE RIGHT TRACK IN THE 1990'S WHEN MY PRESIDENT -- WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS PRESIDENT. INCOME WENT UP FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST FOLKS AT THE TOP. MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES, WORKING FAMILIES, AND WHERE PEOPLE WERE LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY THAN AT ANY TIME IN RECENT HISTORY. WHAT HAPPENED? THE SUPREME COURT ELECTED A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT AND THEY WENT BACK TO TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS. THEY TOOK THEIR EYES OFF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. AND THE MORTGAGE MARKETS. IN COMES A NEW DYNAMIC, AND EXTRAORDINARY YOUNG PRESIDENT, BARACK OBAMA. WHAT DOES HE INHERIT? THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. PRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA CALLS ME SHORTLY AFTER THE 2000 AND -- 2008 ELECTION TO SEE HIM IN CHICAGO. I DID NOT KNOW WHY -- TURNS OUT HE WANTED BE TO BE -- WANTED ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE BUT THE FIRST THING HE TOLD ME WAS THAT THE ECONOMY WAS SO MUCH WORSE THAN WHAT THEY TOLD HIM. 9 MILLION AMERICANS LOST THEIR JOBS. 5 MILLION LOST THEIR HOMES. $13 TRILLION IN FAMILY WEALTH WIPED OUT. PRESIDENT OBAMA DOES NOT GET THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR DIGGING US OUT OF THE DITCH THAT THE REPUBLICANS PUT US IN. I WILL TELL THAT TO EVERYONE. WE WILL WAGE A CAMPAIGN ON THAT BECAUSE IF YOU LISTEN TO THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES, THEY WANT TO TURN THE CLOCK BACK AS IF NONE OF THIS HAS HAPPENED. THANKS TO LEADERS IN THE CONGRESS LIKE CONGRESSMAN CLYBURN WORKING WITH THE PRESIDENT, WE WERE ABLE TO GET OURSELVES OUT OF THAT DITCH, STAND UP AGAIN, GET 40 MILLION JOBS BACK, SAVE THE AUTO INDUSTRY, PUT THE TOUGHEST NEW REGULATIONS ON WALL STREET AND MOST OF THAT DID NOT GET ANY HELP FROM THE REPUBLICANS. SO, I AM A PROUD DEFENDER OF PRESIDENT OBAMA. I WAS HONORED TO SERVE AS HIS SECRETARY OF STATE. WE BECAME NOT JUST PARTNERS, BUT FRIENDS. I AM NOT GOING TO LET THE REPUBLICANS RIP AWAY THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP. I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE HE DID -- THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH HAS MOVED US TOWARDS 80% UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IN OUR COUNTRY. DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT SINCE HARRY TRUMAN. PRESIDENT OBAMA GOT THAT DONE. I HEARD CONGRESSMAN CLYBURN SAY IT WAS CALLED HILLARY CARE. I WORKED REALLY HARD BUT THE COMPANIES STOPPED US. SO I TURNED AROUND AND CREATED THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH FUND. THAT IS WHY I WAS SO THRILLED WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS SUCCESSFULLY GETTING THE -- WAS SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PAST. -- PASSED. REPUBLICANS WANT TO REPEAL IT. I WANT YOU TO ASK -- WHAT WOULD THEY REPLACE IT WITH? YOU WANT TO GET RID OF WHAT WE HAVE THAT IS HELPING ALL OF THESE FOLKS? THEY WANT TO GIVE IT BACK TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SO YOU CAN BE DENIED HEALTH INSURANCE FOR A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, WHERE WOMEN WILL PAY MORE FOR OUR HEALTH INSURANCE THAN MEN AND YOUNG PEOPLE WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO GET ONTO THEIR APPEARANCE POLICY UP TO THE AGE OF 26. WE ARE NOT GOING BACK THERE, MY FRIENDS. WE WILL STAND AND DEFEND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE WILL TAKE IT FURTHER. WE WILL GO AFTER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS WHICH ARE OUT OF SIGHT. WE ARE GOING TO FINALLY MAKE SURE MEDICARE CAN NEGOTIATE FOR LOWER DRUG PRICES BECAUSE ONCE WE GET TO CARE TO DO THAT, THEN PRICES WILL GO DOWN. WE PAY THE HIGHEST PRICES IN THE ADVANCED WORLD FOR DRUGS WE HELPED CREATE THROUGH RESEARCH WITH OUR TAX DOLLARS. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THAT ON, FRONT AND CENTER. WE WILL WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE EDUCATION PROVIDES A QUALITY OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE NO MATTER WHAT ZIP CODE THEY LIVE IN. I WAS OVER IN WILLIAMSBURG COUNTY, ONE OF THE COUNTY THAT IS A LONG INTERSTATE 95. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN A DOCUMENTARY FROM A FEW YEARS AGO THAT WAS CALLED -- THE COURT OR UP -- THE CORRIDOR OF SHAME. THEY FILMED SCHOOLS FALLING DOWN AROUND THE TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. TERRIBLE CONDITIONS. THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE HAS ORDERED THAT THE LEGISLATURE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BUT SO FAR, THEY HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO ACT. I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE IN SOUTH CAROLINA OR AMERICA. YOU ARE ENTITLED TO A FIRST-CLASS EDUCATION. WE WILL WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE SUPPORT PARTICULARLY FOR SCHOOLS THAT ARE EDUCATING LOW INCOME KIDS THAT NEED EXTRA HELP AND SUPPORT. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE MORE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT WILL HELP US GET MORE KIDS READY TO SUCCEED BY THE TIME THEY GET TO KINDERGARTEN OR FIRST GRADE. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE. WE ARE GOING TO LOWER THE COST. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO GO TO COLLEGE, DEBT FREE WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR TUITION. YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO OUR OWN MONEY TO ATTEND COLLEGE, A COLLEGE LIKE THIS THAT HAS SUCH A STORY DID -- STORIED HISTORY . I HAVE A FUND FOR HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE.  BECAUSE I KNOW, I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THEY HAVE BEEN TO EDUCATE SO MANY LEADERS, SO MANY PROFESSIONALS ACROSS THE YEARS. THAT THEY HAVE BEEN OPERATING. WE ARE GOING TO DO MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KEEP EDUCATING YOUNG PEOPLE, NOW AND FAR INTO THE FUTURE.  I ALSO WANT TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM OF STUDENT DEBT. IF YOU HAVE STUDENT DEBT, WE WILL REFINANCE YOUR DEBT AND GET THE COST DOWN. WE WILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO PAY IT AS A PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME AND WE ARE GOING TO BE SURE THAT YOU GET TO PAY IT OFF AT A CERTAIN TIME SO WE DON'T HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE BURDENED BY DEBT. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES THE WAY MANY OF US DID WHEN WE HAD STUDENT DEBT.  THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I HAVE TAKEN A STAND AGAINST THE PRIVATIZATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY. WE ARE GOING TO EXTEND THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND. I NEED YOU TO STAND WITH ME BECAUSE REPUBLICANS STILL DO WANT TO PRIVATIZE IT. THEY SAY THAT OUT LOUD AND IN PUBLIC. WE HAVE GOT TO DEFEND SOCIAL SECURITY. WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT AND DEFEND VOTING RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS ARE UNDER ATTACK ACROSS AMERICA. WE HAVE GOT TO STAND AGAINST EFFORTS AT THE STATE LEVEL TO SUPPRESS THE VOTES AND RESTRICT THE VOTES. WE HAVE TO GO AFTER CITIZENS UNITED, A TERRIBLE SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT OPENED THE DOOR TO SECRETS, UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY, AND WE WILL GET SUPREME COURT JUSTICES APPOINTED STARTING WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO IS FOLLOWING THROUGH ON HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO NOMINATE SOMEONE FOR THE SUPREME COURT.  AND NOW, THE SENATE NEEDS TO DO IS CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND CONSIDER THAT NOMINATION. BUT IF WE CANNOT GET THAT DECISION REVERSED, I WILL LEAD A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT TO STOP THE SECRET, UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE WATCHING AS IT CORRUPTS OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE REFORMED OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT WE REFORMED OUR INCARCERATION SYSTEM. I HAVE LAID OUT VERY SPECIFIC PLANS TO DO THAT AND THIS IS AN AREA THAT I HOPE IS BIPARTISAN. I WAS WITH MY FRIEND SENATOR BOOKER YESTERDAY IN FLORENCE. HE IS ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE SENATE WORKING WITH REPUBLICANS TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT WE NEED. IT IS ALSO IMPERATIVE THAT WE PROTECT THE GAINS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE, NOT ONLY FOR WOMEN, BECAUSE BELIEVE ME, THEY WANT TO TURN THE CLOCK BACK ON US ALSO. I ALSO WANT TO END DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY. THEY DESERVE TO HAVE THEIR RIGHTS AND HAVE THEIR LIVES RESPECTED AS WELL. WE HAVE WORK TO DO, MY FRIENDS AND IT IS IMPORTANT WORK. WORK THAT I CANNOT DO A LOAN. IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO DO IT ALONE. WE NEED TO DO IT TOGETHER. THAT IS WHY I AM ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN THE PRIMARY TOMORROW. I HOPE YOU WILL TURN OUT AND VOTE. I HOPE YOU WILL STAND WITH ME.  BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET THE NOMINATION. I AM DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO EARN IT BUT THEN WE HAVE GOT TO TURN AROUND AND WIN THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER. I KNOW THAT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS THAT SOUTH CAROLINA IS PRETTY MUCH IN THE REPUBLICAN COLUMN THESE DAYS THAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW, WORKING WITH LEADERS LIKE CONGRESSMAN CLYBURN AND OTHERS IN YOUR STATE, IN THE STATE SENATE AND HOUSE AND AT THE COUNTY AND LOCAL LEVEL, I WANT TO HELP SUPPORT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THIS STATE SO WE CAN BE COMPETITIVE IN SOUTH CAROLINA AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES THAT MATTER TO SOUTH CAROLINIANS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE OTHER PARTY. THIS GREAT INSTITUTION DESERVES A LOT MORE HELP FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE THAN IT RECEIVES. WHAT IS THE BEST WAY OF GETTING THAT DONE? ELECT PEOPLE WHO CAN FIGHT FOR YOU AND GET THE NUMBERS UP IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE THAT CASE. I WANT TO END BY SAYING THIS. EVERY DAY I AM OUT HERE CAMPAIGNING AND MAKING THE CASE THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR COUNTRY, I REALLY REMEMBER HOW BLESSED I AM. MY GRANDFATHER WAS A FACTORY WORKER, MY FATHER WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN. MY MOTHER WAS OUT ON HER OWN AT THE AGE OF 14 WORKING AS A MAID. EVERY ONE OF US HAS A STORY TO TELL. IF WE HAD THE TIME, WE COULD HEAR FROM EVERY ONE OF US. WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR COUNTRY LIVES UP TO ITS PROMISE. I WANT TO BREAK EVERY BARRIER THAT STANDS IN THE WAY OF ANY OF AMERICAN OF GETTING A HEAD AND STAYING AHEAD. I KNOW AMERICA CANNOT LIVE UP TO ITS POTENTIAL UNLESS EVERY PERSON IN OUR COUNTRY HAS A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HERS. I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN ME AND THAT YOU WILL BE PART OF THIS EFFORT TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA TO GO FURTHER AND TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT WE ARE FIGHTING TO BREAK DOWN BARRIERS WHEREVER THEY MAY BE BECAUSE WE KNOW AMERICA DESERVES NOTHING LESS AND AMERICANS DESERVE TO HAVE THE FUTURE THAT WE WILL CREATE TOGETHER. THANK YOU ALL, VERY MUCH.     ","Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton Rally in Orangeburg, South Carolina"

LET ME THANK THEM FOR BEING HERE. I'M GOING TO ACKNOWLEDGE EACH OF THEM IN A MINUTE.  HILLARY CLINTON: I WANT TO RECOGNIZE AND ACKNOWLEDGE CONGRESSMEN JIM CLYBURN.  HILLARY CLINTON: AND MRS. EMILY CLIBURN, BOTH OF WHO ARE WITH US THIS EVENING. I ALSO WANT TO IT KNOWLEDGE  SOMEONE WHO I FIRST MET HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. IN COLUMBIA, A LONG TIME AGO, WHEN I CAME AS A YOUNG LAWYER FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND.  TO INVESTIGATE THE DEPLORABLE SITUATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE, YOUNG TEENAGERS.  BEING HELD IN ADULT PRISONS. AND ATTORNEY HERB MUEHL WHO IS HERE WITH US WITH HIS WIFE, I  WANT TO THANK THEM FOR COMING.  HE WAS THE ATTORNEY WHO LED ME TO HIS AUTOMOBILE AT THAT TIME, A STICK SHIFT.  HILLARY CLINTON: I DROVE THAT AROUND THE STATE BUCKING AND  MOVING BACK AND FORTH AS IT WENT FROM PLACE TO PLACE TO INTERVIEW PEOPLE TO GATHER INFORMATION FOR THE LAWSUIT THAT THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND EVENTUALLY FILED WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL BEING INVOLVED IN THAT.  TONIGHT, WE WILL TALK ABOUT TWO VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES. THEY INTERSECT AND THEY ARE DISTINCT BUT THEY HAVE GRAVE CONSEQUENCES.  NOT JUST FOR THE PEOPLE SITTING HERE WITH ME, BUT FOR ALL AMERICANS. YOU WILL HEAR FROM WOMEN WHO HAVE LOST THEIR CHILDREN. THE MOTHERS OF THE MOVEMENT. WHO HAVE SUFFERED AS NO MOTHER EVER SHOULD.  YOU WILL MEET SABRINA FULTON, HER SON, TRAYVON MARTIN, WAS  FOLLOWED AND SHOT IN A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WHERE HIS FATHER LIVED BECAUSE HE WENT OUT TO BUY A PACKET OF SKITTLES. FOUR YEARS AGO, THIS WEEK. YOU WILL MEET LUCY MACBETH, HER TEENAGE SON, JORDANDISTINCT DAVIS, WITH SOME FRIENDS PLAYING MUSIC AS EVERY TEENAGER I EVER HAVE KNOWN DOES, AND HE WAS KILLED. BECAUSE THE MUSIC WAS TOO LOUD. MICHIGAN ARE POISONED BY THE WATER THEY  DRINK. YOU NEED TO BREAK DOWN ALL OF THE BARRIERS IN THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY THAT HOLDS PEOPLE BACK DISPROPORTIONATELY.  WE NEED TO BE BUILDING LADDERS OF OPPORTUNITY. WE NEED TO REBUILD TRUST IN OUR  JUSTICE SYSTEM. TO THE MOTHERS HERE AND MOTHERS EVERYWHERE, WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED A TRAGEDY THAT A VAST MAJORITY OF US NEVER WILL. WHAT I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR IS HOW THEY ARE TURNING THEIR GRIEF  INTO RESOLVE. THEY HAVE BEEN TRAVELING ACROSS  SOUTH CAROLINA THE LAST FEW DAYS  BUT THEY HAVE BEEN TRAVELING ACROSS AMERICA TO ASK FOR THE KIND OF REAL CHANGE THAT WE NEED. THERE ARE MANY STATE AND CITY OFFICIALS WHO ARE ALREADY WORKING TO DO THIS. THEY ARE HAVING REAL POLICE  INVOLVED SHOOTINGS AND IN CUSTODY DEATHS HANDLED BY INDEPENDENT AUTHORITIES. I SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS. TODAY, I AM ANNOUNCING THAT WE WILL PROVIDE FEDERAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE STATE AND LOCALLY DRIVEN APPROACH.  HILLARY CLINTON: TACKLING AND ENDING SYSTEMIC RACISM REQUIRES CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ALL OF US. WHITE AMERICANS, WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF LISTENING WHEN AFRICAN-AMERICANS TALK ABOUT THE  SEEN AND UNSEEN BARRIERS THEY FACE EVERY DAY. WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE OUR PRIVILEGE AND PRACTICE HUMILITY. RATHER THAN ASSUME THAT OUR EXPERIENCES ARE EVERYONE'S EXPERIENCES. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IF WE WORK TOGETHER, TO MAKE MAJOR NEW INVESTMENTS IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN LEFTRATHER THAN ASSUME THAT OUR  EXPERIENCES BEHIND, AND  GUARANTEE JUSTICE AND DIGNITY TO  EVERY AMERICAN, THAT WILL  BENEFIT ALL OF US. I REALLY APPLAUD CONGRESSMAN CLYBURN'S PLAN AS TO HOW TO BETTER DISTRIBUTE FEDERAL PLANS. SO THAT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND OVER SO MANY YEARS CAN HAVE A BETTER CHANCE TO LIFT THEMSELVES UP.  HILLARY CLINTON: OUR PROBLEM WITH VIOLENCE GOES FAR BEYOND  THE TERRIBLE CASES WHERE THE  POLICE ARE INVOLVED. THAT IS WHY I AM DEEPLY HONORED TO HAVE GABBY GIFFORDS AND HER HUSBAND WITH US.  HILLARY CLINTON: THE EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE STOCKING OUR LAND IS ANOTHER BARRIER HOLDING US BACK. 33,000 AMERICANS FOR YEAR ARE THIS IS NOT JUST AN URBAN PROBLEM AS SOME LIKE TO SAY. IT IS A PROBLEM FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. GABBY GIFFORDS WAS SHOT WHILE MEETING WITH HER CONSTITUENTS IN THE PARKING LOT OF A SHOPPING MALL.  SHE WAS DOING HER JOB. SIX PEOPLE DIED THAT DAY. INCLUDING A NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO WAS SO EXCITED BECAUSE SHE WAS GOING TO GET TO MEET HER CONGRESSWOMAN. SHE WAS STANDING IN LINE TO DO JUST THAT. I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT CAPI AND MARK HAVE BEEN TAKING ON THE GUN LOBBY TIRELESSLY, FIGHTING FOR  COMMONSENSE REFORM. WE SHOULD ALL JOIN THEMKILLED BY GUN VIOLENCE. IN THIS EFFORT.  HILLARY CLINTON: WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS. WE NEED TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE WRONG HANDS. WE NEED TO CLOSE THE CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE. THAT LED THE KILLER THERE GET A GUN, EVEN THOUGH HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ORDERED. WE NEED TO REVOKE THE SPECIAL  IMMUNITY GUN DEALERS AND MANUFACTURERS THAT THEY HAVE TODAY THANKS TO A VOTE BY THE CONGRESS. THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR PRODUCTS JUST LIKE ANY  OTHER COMPANY. AND WE NEED TO CRACK DOWN ON PURCHASING AND MAKE THIS A FEDERAL CRIME. AND FOR GOODNESS SAKES, WE SHOULD BAR PEOPLE ON THE NO-FLY  LIST, THE TERRORIST LIST FROM  BUYING GUNS IN THE UNITED STATES.  HILLARY CLINTON: I KNOW THE  POLITICS ARE HARD. I AM WELL AWARE. BUT SOMETIMES THE HARD THING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP TRYING TO DO. WE CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SAID WE NEED TO MAKE IT A VOTING ISSUE AND I AGREE COMPLETELY. SO PLEASE, JOIN ME IN WELCOMING AGAIN, THESE REMARKABLE PEOPLE  WHO ARE TAKING THIS JOURNEY ON BEHALF OF ALL OF US.   >> HAVE A CHANCE TO TELL YOU PERSONALLY --  HILLARY CLINTON: PEOPLE OF COURAGE AND COMMITMENT. >> THANK YOU. I AM THE MOTHER OF TRAYVON MARTIN.  >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WOW.  >>  YOU KNOW, THE COURAGE, THE COMMITMENT, TURNING SORROW INTO STRATEGY, IT IS JUST SUCH A GREAT MESSAGE FOR EVERYBODY. SOMETHING THAT I HOPE PEOPLE  TAKE WITH YOU WHEN YOU LEAVE HERE TONIGHT. SOMETHING THAT IS YES, IMPORTANT FOR EACH OF US APPEAR, BUT SHOULD BE -- IMPORTANT FOR EACH OF US UP HERE, BUT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR EACH OF US. I HAVE DETERMINED THAT TOGETHER WE WILL HAVE JUSTICE. WE WILL REFORM THE CRIMINAL  JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE WILL PROVIDE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE IN POSITIONS OF POWER AND RESPONSIBILITY. WE WILL MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY MEASURES TO DEAL WITH THE GUN CULTURE AND THE EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE. WE WILL KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE WILL LOOK OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER. WE WILL SHOW MORE KINDNESS, MORE RESPECT FOR EVERY HUMAN BEING. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US DESERVES NOTHING LESS THAN THAT.  I THANK THESE EXTRAORDINARY MOTHERS. I THANK MARC AND GABBY FOR BEING WITH ME TONIGHT. I REALLY HOPE THAT THIS IS THE BEGINNING, THAT THIS IS A MOVEMENT, THAT YES, IT DOES RESULT IN CHANGE. AND IT DOES BRING MORE PEOPLE, AS PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID, TO  CONSIDER GUNS AND VIOLENCE AS A VOTING ISSUE. SOMETHING THAT WILL MOTIVATE YOU AND THOSE YOU KNOW TO TURN OUT ON SATURDAY FOR THE SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY, TO TURN OUT IN NOVEMBER, AND TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE CHANGES WE DESERVE TO SEE.

YOU TURNED OUT IN EVERY CORNER OF THIS STATE, WITH DETERMINATION AND PURPOSE. HOTEL AND CASINO WORKERS WHO NEVER WAVERED.   STUDENTS WITH TOO MUCH DEBT, AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO NEVER GO OFF THE  TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MEN AND WOMEN WITH KIDS TO RAISE, BILLS TO PAY, AND DREAMS OF THAT WON'T DIE. THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. AND IT IS A CAMPAIGN TO BREAK DOWN EVERY BARRIER THAT HOLDS YOU BACK. THEY ARE GOING TO BUILD OPPORTUNITY IN ITS PLACE, SO EVERY AMERICAN CAN GO AS FAR AS YOUR HARD WORK TAKES YOU. AND FOR THE THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEERS AND ORGANIZERS THAT WORKED SO HARD IN THE STATE --   TO THE MORE THAN 750,000 PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED ME ON HILLARYCLINTON.COM, AND CONTRIBUTED WHAT YOU COULD, THE VAST MAJORITY OF GIVING LESS THAN $100, AND TO THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS OUR COUNTRY, WHO ARE SUPPORTING OUR CAMPAIGN, THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.   WE HEAR YOU, WE SEE YOU, WE ARE INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL TO YOU, BECAUSE WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER. WE LOOK AT OUR COUNTRY, AND SEE SO MUCH THAT IS NOT WORKING THE WAY IT SHOULD. WE SEE GRANDPARENTS FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PAYING RENT AND BUYING MEDICINE, BECAUSE A PRESCRIPTION DRUG COMPANY HAS RAISED THE PRICE IS 5000% OVERNIGHT. WE SEE AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES DENIED MORTGAGES AT NEARLY THREE TIMES THE RATE OF WHITE FAMILIES. WE SEE SMALL TOWNS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY LOTS JOBS AND LOST HOPE. WE SEE RISING GENERATIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE COMING OF AGE IN A WORLD WHERE OPPORTUNITY THINGS OUT OF REACH. WORST OF ALL, WE SEE CHILDREN GROWING UP IN POVERTY OR PAIN OR FEAR. HERE IN NEVADA, A BRAVE YOUNG GIRL TOLD ME HOW SCARED SHE IS. THAT HER PARENTS WOULD BE DEPORTED. IN SOUTH CAROLINA, I MET CHILDREN TRYING TO LEARN IN CRUMBLING CLASSROOMS AND NEGLECTED COMMUNITIES. AND THEN THERE IS FLINT, MICHIGAN. WHERE CHILDREN WERE POISONED I TOXIC WATER, JUST BECAUSE THEIR GOVERNOR ONE TO SAVE A LITTLE MONEY. AMERICANS ARE RIGHT TO BE ANGRY. BUT WE ARE ALSO HUNGRY FOR REAL SOLUTIONS.   IN THE CAMPAIGN, YOU READ A LOT ABOUT WASHINGTON AND WALL STREET. WE ALSO WANT TO GET UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY OUT OF POLITICS, WHICH STARTS WITH APPOINTING A NEW SUPREME JUSTICE TO THE COURT.   WHO WILL PROTECT THE RIGHT OF EVERY CITIZEN TO VOTE, NOT EVERY CORPORATION TO BUY ELECTIONS. AND WE ALSO AGREE THAT WALL STREET CAN NEVER BE ALLOWED TO THREATEN MAINSTREET AGAIN. NO EXECUTIVES SHOULD BE TOO POWERFUL FOR JAIL. IF WE LISTEN TO THE VOICES OF FLINT, AND FERGUSON, IF WE OPEN OUR HEARTS TO THE FAMILIES, IF WE LISTENED TO THE OPENHEARTED OF HARD-WORKING PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA, IT IS CLEAR THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO BE DONE. THE TRUTH IS, WE ARE NOT A SINGLE ISSUE COUNTRY.   WE NEED MORE THAN EIGHT PLAN FOR A BANK, THE MIDDLE CLASS NEEDS A RAISE. WE NEED MORE JOBS A. WE NEED JOBS THAT CAN'T BE OUTSOURCED, JOBS OF DIGNITY AND A FUTURE. WE CAN DO THIS BY UNLEASHING THE INNOVATION OF OUR ENTREPRENEURS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. WE CAN DO THIS WITH NEW INFRASTRUCTURE, AND CLEAN ENERGY, ESPECIALLY HERE IN NEVADA.   SOMEBODY, SOME COUNTRY WILL BE THE ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF THE 21ST CENTURY. IT WILL BE CHINA, GERMANY, OR US, AND I WANTED  WE ALSO HAVE TO DO MORE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PARENTS TO BALANCE WORK AND FAMILY, AND TO BREAK DOWN BARRIERS TO KEEP SO MANY PEOPLE ON THE SIDELINES OF THE ECONOMY, ESPECIALLY WOMEN. DON'T YOU THINK WE HAVE WAITED LONG ENOUGH? IT IS TIME FOR EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK.   AND ALL YOU THINK IT IS TIME TO FACE HEAD-ON THE REALITY OF RACISM, AND THE COMMUNITY? LEFT OUT AND LEFT BEHIND, REFORMING OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM DURING ENSURING THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK AND FULLY PARTICIPATE IN OUR SOCIETY.  IT MEANS, TO MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING HOLDS YOU BACK, NOT DEBT, NOT DISCRIMINATION, NOTHING. NO ONE CAN GET THIS DONE ALONE, NOT EVEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IT HAS GOT TO BE THE MISSION OF OUR ENTIRE NATION. I HAVE NEVER BELIEVED THAT DIVIDING AMERICA BETWEEN US AND THEM. WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. WE ALL HAVE TO DO OUR PART.   SO LET ME SAY THIS TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO RUN OUR COUNTRY. IF YOU CHEAT YOUR EMPLOYEES, EXPLOIT CONSUMERS, POLLUTE OUR ENVIRONMENT, OR RIP OFF TAXPAYERS, WE ARE GOING TO HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE.   BUT, IF YOU DO THE RIGHT THING, INVEST IN YOUR WORKERS, YOUR COMMUNITY, HELPED BUILD A BETTER AMERICA, WE ARE GOING TO STAND WITH YOU, AND GO INTO THE FUTURE TOGETHER. WE NEED MORE JOBS, MORE OPPORTUNITIES. AND I WANT TO SAY THIS TO ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE OUT THERE. I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE UP AGAINST. IF YOU LET COLLEGE, A KIND OF LOANS, IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT MAKING COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE, YOU NEED HELP RIGHT NOW WITH THE DEBT YOU ALREADY CAP.   THAT IS WHY I HAVE A PLAN, TO CAP PAYMENTS SO YOU NEVER HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD.   BUT I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS. IT CANNOT BE JUST ABOUT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO GIVE TO YOU. IT HAS TO BE ABOUT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BUILD TOGETHER.   YOUR GENERATION IS THE MOST CONNECTED OUR COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN. IN THE DAYS AHEAD, WE WILL PROPOSE NEW WAYS FOR MORE AMERICANS TO GET INVOLVED IN NATIONAL SERVICE, AND GIVE BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES, BECAUSE EVERYONE OF US HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN BUILDING THE FUTURE WE WANT. WASHINGTON IS NEVER GOING TO HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS, BUT FOR EVERY PROBLEM WE FACE, SOMEWHERE, SOMEONE IN AMERICA IS SOLVING IT. WE NEED YOU TO BE PART OF THAT EXCITING JOURNEY WE CAN MAKE TOGETHER. WE NEED THE COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS TO DECIDE ABOUT THE SCHOOL BOARD. THE ENTREPRENEURS DO NOT LEAVE A HOMETOWN THAT HAS SEEN BETTER DAYS. WE NEED MILLIONS OF TEACHERS AND NURSES, POLICE OFFICERS, FIREFIGHTERS, TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY A SAFER, BETTER PLACE. EACH OF US WORKING TOGETHER, GROWING TOGETHER. LOOKING OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER, AND LIFTING EACH OTHER UP. THERE IS A BASIC TRUTH ABOUT AMERICA, SOMETHING THAT BILL AND I HAVE BEEN THE BENEFICIARIES OF, THAT WE HAVE TRIED TO CONTRIBUTE TO, AND WHILE WE COULD TO CONTINUE. AMERICANS CAN ONLY LIVE UP TO THEIR POTENTIAL. EACH AND EVERY AMERICAN HAS A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO YOUR POTENTIAL, TOOL. IMAGINE, NO CHILD GROWING UP WITH DISCRIMINATION, OR THE SPECTER OF DEPORTATION. EVERY CHILD IN EVERY ZIP CODE GET THE EDUCATION HE OR SHE NEEDS  IMAGINE A TOMORROW WHERE EVERY PARENT CAN FIND A GOOD WHERE SMALL BUSINESSES THRIVE AND BIG BUSINESSES PLAY BY THE RULES, GIVING MORE BACK TO THE COUNTRY THAT GAVE THEM SO MUCH. WHERE HARD WORK IS HONORED, FAMILIES ARE SUPPORTED, AND COMMUNITIES ARE STRONG. WITH YOUR HELP, THAT IS THE TOMORROW WE WILL BUILD OUR COUNTRY. SO PLEASE JOIN US. GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM TO BECOME PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN. LET'S DO THIS TOGETHER. NOW, I AM HEADING ON --    I AM ON MY WAY TO TEXAS, BILL IS ON HIS WAY TO COLORADO. THE FIGHT GOES ON. THE FUTURE THAT WE WANT IS WITHIN OUR GRASP. THANK YOU ALL. GOD BLESS YOU.

IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE HERE, REUNITED WITH SO MANY FRIENDS, SUPPORTING A STATE WITH SUCH A LONG PROUD TRADITION. SO MANY MINNESOTANS HAVE INSPIRED US WITH PRINCIPLED LEADERSHIP. WANT HER MONTELL. PAUL MILLSTONE. I HAD THE GREAT HONOR OF SERVING WITH PAUL AND SHEILA, SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE TALKING WITH HIM ABOUT WHAT WE WANTED TO SEE HAPPEN TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENTED, AND I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT HIM IN THE LAST MONTH. HE WAS A TRUE PROGRESSIVE WHO WANTED TO GET THINGS DONE. HE WANTED TO MAKE PROGRESS. I MISS HIM, AND I THINK YOU -- I THANK YOU FOR SENDING HIM TO SERVE. ADDING TO THAT LIST THERE ARE MANY OF YOU HERE TONIGHT, SOMEONE ELSE I SERVED WITH, SPENT A LOT OF TIME SITTING IN THE BACK ROW, FIRST-TERM SENATOR'S AS YOUR GOVERNOR, MARK DAVIES.  THERE'S A LOT TO BE SAID ABOUT MARK. YOU KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE HE HAS BEEN. HOW HE HAS STOOD AGAINST THE TIDE OF TEA PARTY REPUBLICANISM. HOW HE HAS THE HIGHEST JOB GROWTH RECORD IN THE UNITED STATES. KNOWING MARK, THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. THEY WANT TO FOCUS ON WHAT CAN BE DONE TO CREATE MORE JOBS AND PLACES THAT ARE NOT SEEING THAT KIND OF ECONOMIC GROWTH. MARK IS DETERMINED HE IS GOING TO MAKE PROGRESS EVERYWHERE IN YOUR STATE. I WANT TO THANK HIS TERRIFIC LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR.  I WANT TO THANK MY TWO FRIENDS AND FORMER COLLEAGUES, YOUR SENATORS, AMY CLOVER SHAR AND AL FRANKEN. YOU KNOW WHAT TREASURES THEY ARE. YOU GET TO SEE THEM ALL THE TIME. THEY ARE ACTUALLY WORKING THEIR HEARTS OUT, STUMPING ACROSS THE COUNTRY FROM ME. EVERYWHERE THEY GO PEOPLE ARE BLOWN AWAY. THEY WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THEM. THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY CAN DO TO ELECT PROGRESSIVE SENATORS LIKE THEM. AMY AND OUT OUR GREAT FRIENDS AND EVEN BETTER PUBLIC SERVANTS. TO CHRIS COLMAN AND BETSY HODGES, THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS REPRESENTING YOU, THE CITY OFFICIALS WHO POUR YOUR HEART'S INTO SERVING THE PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA AND OUR COUNTRY, I THANK YOU. WE HAVE COME TOGETHER AT AN IMPORTANT MOMENT. WHEN I STARTED THIS CAMPAIGN LAST APRIL, I KNEW WE WERE FACING CHALLENGES AS A COUNTRY. TALKING TO FAMILIES ACROSS AMERICA HAS MADE IT EVEN CLEARER TO ME. IT IS APPALLING TO ENCOUNTER THE INDIFFERENCE AND NEGLECT THAT I SAW FIRSTHAND WHEN I WENT TO FLINT LAST SUNDAY. THOSE CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE BEEN POISONED WITH LEAD IN THEIR WATER BECAUSE THEIR GOVERNOR WANTED TO SAVE MONEY.  WHEN I HEAR ABOUT THE MAN IN NEVADA TAKING CARE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S LOVED ONES FOR 40 YEARS, AND SHE HAS NEVER EARNED ENOUGH TO PUT AWAY EVEN ONE PENNY FOR HER OWN RETIREMENT, THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG. IT IS WRONG THAT THE CASHIER I MET IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IS PAID LESS THAN HER SON FOR DOING THE SAME JOB AT THE SAME COMPANY WHERE SHE IS ACTUALLY WORKS LONGER. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT ELSE IS WRONG. IT IS WRONG AMERICAN COMPANIES PLAY LEGAL TRICKS TO SELL THEMSELVES ON PAPER TO COMPANIES OVERSEAS TO AVOID PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES AT HOME. THE MOST EGREGIOUS EXAMPLE OF THAT IS A COMPANY FROM WISCONSIN CALLED JOHNSON CONTROLS. JOHNSON CONTROLS MAKES AUTO PARTS. WHEN THE ECONOMY CRASHED IN 2008, THEY ALONG WITH THE AUTO COMPANIES CAME TO WASHINGTON ASKING FOR HELP. IN FACT, THEY WENT FROM OFFICE TO OFFICE, REPUBLICAN'S RESPONSE WAS LET THE AUTO INDUSTRY DIED. TAKE MILLIONS OF JOBS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND LET THEM JUST DIE. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS LISTENS, CONSTRUCTED A PROGRAM TO HELP PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE COMPANIES AND SUPPLIERS. IT WORKS SO WELL THAT THOSE COMPANIES PAID BACK THE U.S. TREASURY AHEAD OF TIME. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST MONTH? JOHNSON CONTROL ANNOUNCED AND THEY ARE TURNING THEIR BACK ON AMERICA. THEY ARE PRETENDING TO SELL THEMSELVES TO A COMPANY IN EUROPE. THEY ARE PRETENDING TO MOVE HEADQUARTERS. THEY ARE MOVING THEIR PROFITS TO IRELAND. IN ORDER TO AVOID PAYING TAXES TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE THAT HELPED THEM IN THEIR TIME OF NEED AND CAP THEIR COMPANY GOING. THAT IS CALLED AN AD VERSION -- A VERSION IN THE TAX LAW. I CALL IT A PERVERSION AND WE ARE GOING TO SHUT DOWN THOSE ABUSES WHEN I GET INTO OFFICE.  THERE IS NO WONDER PEOPLE ARE A GREAT THEY HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE. THEY ARE ALSO HUNGRY. THEY ARE HUNGRY FOR SOLUTIONS THEY CAN COUNT ON. WE HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WASHINGTON AND WALL STREET IN THIS CAMPAIGN. I WANT TO GET UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY OUT OF POLITICS, AS MUCH AS ANYONE, PROBABLY MORE THAN MOST. A LITTLE KNOWN FACT, CITIZENS UNITED WAS ABOUT A RIGHT-WING ATTACK ON ME. ONE OF MANY OVER THE YEARS TO TRY TO UNDERMINE AND PUSH BACK THE VIEWS AND VALUES I HAVE A SPOUSE. ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY CAMPAIGN I SAID WE ARE GOING TO OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED. WE WILL USE THE SUPREME COURT APPOINTMENTS, AND I WILL LEAD A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO GET CONTROL BACK OVER THE FINANCING OF POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS. I HAVE ALSO MADE IT CLEAR WE CAN'T LET WALL STREET THREATEN MAINSTREET AGAIN. NO EXECUTIVE TOO POWERFUL TO JAIL. WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT. THANKS TO PRESIDENT OBAMA, YOUR SENATORS AND OTHERS, THE TOUGHEST REGULATIONS ON WALL STREET SINCE THE 1930'S WERE PASSED IN THE DODD FRANK HILL, THAT GIVES THE GOVERNMENT THE AUTHORITY TO GO AFTER ANY BANK THAT POSES A SYSTEMIC RISK. THAT IS AVAILABLE. IT HAS TO BE USED IF APPROPRIATE. I WILL USE IT. I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THIS. AFTER WE GET ANYTHING WE CAN TO GET CONTROL OVER THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY, GET CONTROL AGAIN OVER CAMPAIGN FINANCE, WE CAN'T STOP THERE. WE NEED TO GET JOB GROWING, AND INCOMES RISING. TO MANY AMERICANS CAN'T FIND A GOOD PAYING JOB NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY TRY. PEOPLE HAVEN'T HAD A RAISE IN 15-16 YEARS. WE NEED A MISSION TO CREATE JOBS IN CLEAN ENERGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE. WE NEED A DEAL WITH HIGH COLLEGE COSTS AND STUDENT DEBT. THEY ARE HOLDING SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE BACK FROM STARTING THEIR LIVES. WE NEED TO CREATE MORE JOBS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE BEING OUT OF WORK AT THE START OF YOUR CAREER CAN HAVE LIFELONG REPERCUSSIONS. EARLIER TODAY, AND SOUTH CAROLINA I SHARED MY PLAN TO HELP MOVE 46,000 UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE IN MINNESOTA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO BE AGAINST THINGS. THAT IS IMPORTANT. BUT AMERICA, WE ARE THE NATION THAT GETS THINGS DONE, THAT CHARTS THE FUTURE, THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. WE NEED AN AGENDA TO UNLEASH THE INNOVATION OF OUR ENTREPRENEURS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. WE HAVE TO TACKLE THE ECONOMY. WE HAVE TO TACKLE THE BARRIERS THAT STAND IN THE WAY OF PEOPLE GETTING AHEAD. THERE ARE OTHER BARRIERS HOLDING AMERICANS BACK. AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES WHO FACE DISCRIMINATION GENERATION AFTER GENERATION. THEY HAVE A FRACTION OF THE WEALTH OF WHITE FAMILIES. THEY GET DENIED A MORTGAGE THREE TIMES AS OFTEN. THEY FACE OTHER CHALLENGES IN HEALTH AND EDUCATION. THAT IS A BARRIER. THAT IS A BARRIER THAT STANDS IN THE WAY OF THEIR DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS. HAVING $11,000 OF WEALTH IS AN INDICTMENT. BUT ALSO A REFLECTION. OF THE DEEPLY ENTRENCHED DISCRIMINATION THAT IS FACED. THINK ABOUT PRICES OF SO MANY YOUNG BLACK PEOPLE DYING AFTER ENCOUNTERS WITH POLICE LIKE CLARK SHOT AND KILLED A FEW MONTHS AGO NOT FAR FROM WHERE WE SIT TONIGHT. THINK ABOUT IMMIGRANT FAMILIES LYING AWAKE AT NIGHT LISTENING FOR A KNOCK ON THE DOOR IN THE NIGHT IT STATES OF AMERICA. , WORKING IN THE SHADOWS, VULNERABLE TO UNSCRUPULOUS EMPLOYERS. THINK OF THE WOMEN IN OUR COUNTRY STILL FIGHTING FOR EQUAL PAY, STILL STRUGGLING TO GET ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE CARE WHILE AMERICANS GO AFTER PLANNED PARENTHOOD AGAIN AND AGAIN. THINK OF THE NEW PARENTS STRUGGLING TO TAKE CARE OF THAT NEWBORN BABY, MAYBE A SICK RELATIVE, WHEN THEIR JOB DOESN'T OFFER PAID LEAVE. I WANT TO APPLAUD GOVERNOR DAYTON FOR HIS PROPOSAL FOR PAID PARENTAL LEAVE HERE IN THIS STATE. IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WE HAVE TO DO IT ACROSS OUR NATION. TALK ABOUT SCHOOLS, AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONE I VISITED IN SOUTH CAROLINA TODAY. THEY ARE PART OF WHAT IS CALLED THE CORRIDOR OF SHAME. ALONG I-95,  SCHOOLS CRUMBLING AND DECREPIT. THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES, THE TEACHERS TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE GET THE BEST POSSIBLE EDUCATION. I WAS MOVED BY THE LETTERS SEVERAL SIGNED LAST WEEK ASKING THE WHITE HOUSE TO ALLOCATE MORE FUNDS FOR SCHOOLS THAT EDUCATE NATIVE AMERICAN KIDS RIGHT HERE IN MINNESOTA.  IF I AM FORTUNATE AS TO BECOME YOUR PRESIDENT I WILL BE YOUR PARTNER EVERY SINGLE DAY, WORKING WITH YOU TO SERVE ALL OF MINNESOTA'S CHILDREN. ALL OF US KNOW, DON'T WE? DON'T WE KNOW WE NEED REAL SOLUTIONS TO THE CHALLENGES WE FACE? I'M RUNNING TO TEAR DOWN ALL THE BARRIERS THAT HOLD PEOPLE BACK ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. I AM NOT MAKING PROMISES I CAN'T KEEP. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE --   A DAY COMES ALONG WHERE WE MAKE SOMETHING BIG AND EXTRAORDINARY HAPPEN ALL AT ONCE. BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE, THAT IS NOT HOW WE MAKE CHANGE MOST OF THE TIME. TO MAKE CHANGE HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN, YOU HAVE TO KEEP WORKING AT IT. YOU HAVE TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR IT DAY AFTER DAY. IF YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN, YOU GET BACK UP. I REMEMBER BACK IN THE EARLY 1990'S, I WAS WORKING DAY AND NIGHT TO PASS UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. WE FACED A LOT OF THE SAME OBSTACLES AND CRITICISMS. THEY WENT RIGHT AT ME. WE DIDN'T GET WHAT WE WANTED. YES, WE WERE KNOCKED DOWN, AND WE WERE SET BACK. BY THEN I HAD TRAVELED ACROSS AMERICA. I HAD MET COUNTLESS AMERICANS WHO HAD BEEN DENIED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. THEY HAD A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. THEY HIT A LIFETIME LIMIT. I REMEMBER BEING IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN CLEVELAND TALKING TO A GROUP OF PARENTS WITH VERY SICK CHILDREN. THEY WERE TELLING ME WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO HAVE A CHILD THAT NEEDED A LOT OF MEDICAL CARE. AND NOT BE ABLE TO GUARANTEE THEY COULD HAVE THAT PROVIDED. ONE FATHER SAID I'M A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN. I ACTUALLY RUN A BUSINESS. I PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO MY EMPLOYEES. I CAN'T GET HEALTH CARE FOR MORE TO DOLLAR -- FOR MY TWO DAUGHTERS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS. I GO FROM INSURANCE COMPANY TO INSURANCE COMPANY. I SAY I CAN PAY SOMETHING. GIVE ME WHAT I CAN PAY FOR. THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS THE SAME, NO. WHAT DO THEY TELL YOU? HE SAID, THE LAST MEETING I HAD, I WAS TALKING TO THE AGENT MAKING THE SAME CASE I'VE MADE SO MANY TIMES BEFORE. HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. WE DON'T ENSURE BURNING HOUSES. THIS MAN LOOKED AT ME WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES AND SAID THEY CALLED MY LITTLE GIRLS BURNING HOUSES. I COULDN'T GET THAT AND OTHER STORIES OUT OF MY MIND. WHEN WE DIDN'T GET EVERYTHING WE WANTED, WHEN WE GOT KNOCKED DOWN, I SAID WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE MAKE PROGRESS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. I GOT TO WORK WITH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO FIND COMMON GROUND, TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE'S MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US, OUR CHILDREN. WE WERE ABLE TO PASS THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM WHICH NOW IS A LIFELINE FOR 8 MILLION KIDS ACROSS AMERICA.  I NEVER GAVE UP ON THE DREAM OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, NOT FOR A SECOND. AN 8 MILLION KIDS, IT WAS IN EVERYTHING WE WANTED. BUT IT WAS REAL. IT WAS ACHIEVABLE. IT MADE A PROFOUND DIFFERENCE. I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD LEAVE CHILDREN WITHOUT HEALTH CARE, EVEN A SINGLE DAY LONGER THAN WE HAD TO. THAT IS WHY I WAS THRILLED WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THAT HAS BEEN A GOAL OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SINCE HARRY TRUMAN.  IT IS HELPING SO MANY PEOPLE RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE 90% COVERAGE. 10% SHORT OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. NO MORE DENIALS BECAUSE OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. YOUNG PEOPLE UP TO THE AGE OF 26 YEARS OLD CAN BE ON THEIR PARENTS POLICY. WOMEN NO LONGER PAY MORE FOR OUR INSURANCE THAN MEN. AND NO MORE LIFETIME LIMITS.  YES, I'M GOING TO DEFEND IT. I KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS TO ACCOMPLISH. I WANT TO IMPROVE IT. IF THE COSTS DOWN. GET TO 100% COVERAGE. AND DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO REIN IN PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS BY GOING AT THE DRUG COMPANIES REQUIRING THEM TO NEGOTIATE FOR LOWER PRICES WITH MEDICARE, AND GOING AFTER PREDATORY PRICING, WHICH WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST MONTHS RESULT IN PRICE INCREASES OF 4-5000% OVERNIGHT. I LEARNED FROM MY FAMILY AND MY FAITH TO TRY TO DO ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN, AS LONG AS YOU CAN, FOR AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN. WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE HURTING, OR BEING TREATED UNJUSTLY, AND YOU THINK YOU CAN HELP THEM, MAYBE MAKE THEIR LIVES BETTER, YOU HAVE GOT TO DO IT. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO HAS HAD BLESSINGS. WHO YES, HAS BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, BUT ABLE TO GET BACK UP. THAT IS WHY I SAY WITH ALL MY HEART I AM GOING TO BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE KIT CARE ACT -- CARE ACT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO PLUNGE THIS COUNTRY INTO SOME NATIONAL DEBATE. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE ON THE DRUG COMPANIES. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE ON THE COSTS. WE ARE GOING TO FINALLY ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. WE ARE GOING TO DO ALL OF THAT.  SO MANY PEOPLE WITH FAMILIES DEPEND ON US DOING THAT. THAT IS THE PATH FORWARD, NOT A DIVISIVE DEBATE. IT IS ABOUT THE SHAPE OF WHAT COULD BE DONE, A WHOLE SYSTEM THAT WILL STOP US IN OUR TRACKS, CREATE GRIDLOCK, AND NOT MOVE US FORWARD. HERE IS MY PROMISE TO ALL OF YOU. I WILL WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE, ACTUALLY, TO MAKE CHANGES THAT IMPROVE LIVES. TOGETHER WE WILL BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA, TO BREAK ALL THE BARRIERS THAT HOLD AMERICANS BACK. I WAS HONORED AFTER RUNNING A HARD CAMPAIGN AGAINST SENATOR OBAMA TO BE ASKED TO SERVE AS HIS SECRETARY OF STATE. THE TRUSTEE PLACED IN ME, THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAD TO WORK TOGETHER -- ON BEHALF OF OUR FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY, IT WAS AN ENORMOUS PRIVILEGE. I HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT IN WATCHING HIM DO WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE, RESPONDING TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. I DON'T THINK HE GETS THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR SAVING OUR ECONOMY FROM THE HORRIBLE DITCH THE REPUBLICANS DROVE US INTO IN 2008.  I THINK HE HAS SHOWN GREAT PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP IN DEALING WITH THE OPPOSITION OF THE RIGHT-WING AND THE REPUBLICANS OF THE TEA PARTY.  I THINK MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE BETTER OFF BECAUSE OF HIS PRESIDENCY. I WILL BUILD ON THE PROGRESS HE HAS MADE BECAUSE I AM A PROGRESSIVE WHO ACTUALLY LIKES TO MAKE PROGRESS.  YOU KNOW, THOSE OF US WHO ARE GRANDPARENTS KNOW THE OLDER YOU  GET, FUNNY ENOUGH, THE MORE YOU START THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE. SO IMAGINE TOMORROW WHERE HARD WORK IS HONORED AND REWARDED WITH RISING INCOMES, WHERE WE  PRODUCE ENOUGH RENEWABLE ENERGY  TO POWER EVERY HOME IN AMERICA  AND CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD JOBS DOING IT. WHERE EDUCATION LIFTS YOU UP AND SOON A DEBT DOESN'T DRAG YOU DOWN. WHERE MORE ENTREPRENEURS CAN  START AND GROW NEW SMALL BUSINESSES. IMAGINE A TOMORROW WHERE EVERY AMERICAN KNOWS THAT, NO MATTER WHAT THEIR RACE OR RELIGION OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY, THEY'LL HAVE AN EQUAL SHOT AT ACHIEVING THEIR DREAMS  BECAUSE THIS IS THEIR COUNTRY TOO. IMAGINE A TOMORROW WHERE GUN  VIOLENCE NO LONGER STALKS OUR  COUNTRY AND ELECTED OFFICIALS  STAND UP TO THE GUN LOBBY, NOT  GET INTIMIDATED. IMAGINE A TOMORROW WHERE AMERICA IS SAFE AT HOME AND STRONG IN  THE WORLD. THAT'S THE TOMORROW WE WANT. FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR  GRANDCHILDREN AND FOR OUR COUNTRY. SO WHEN YOU GO TO CAUCUS ON  MARCH 1, I HOPE YOU WILL ASK  YOURSELF, ""WHO CAN YOU COUNT ON  TO BREAK DOWN EVERY BARRIER, NOT JUST SOME?"" AND THINK ABOUT THIS. THINK ABOUT THIS AS YOU GO. YES, WALL STREET AND BIG FINANCIAL INTERESTS ALONG WITH  DRUG COMPANIES, INSURANCE COMPANIES, BIG OIL ALL HAVE TOO  MUCH INFLUENCE AND I WILL FIGHT EVERY SINGLE DAY TO EVEN THE  ODDS. BUT EVEN IF WE WERE ABLE TO GET RID OF ALL OF THAT UNDUE  INFLUENCE TOMORROW, WE WOULD  STILL HAVE THE CRUEL NEGLIGENCE  WE SAW IN FLINT. WE WOULD STILL HAVE THE KIND OF ANTI-MUSLIM DEMAGOGUERY THAT WE  HAVE SEEN IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND  WHICH MUST END. WE WOULD STILL HAVE  DISCRIMINATION IN SO MANY FORMS  WE WOULD STILL HAVE POWERFUL VOICES DENYING CLIMATE CHANGE,  OPPOSING EVERY SINGLE COMMON  SENSE GUN SAFETY REFORM. AND WE WOULD STILL HAVE REPUBLICAN REPUBLICAN REPUBLICAN IDEALOGUES RIPPING THE HEART OUT OF WORK EARS RIGHTS, THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE, TO AND THE UP, TO BE PART OF A  UNION FOR BETTER WAGES AND  WORKING CONDITIONS.  MY FRIENDS, I AM NOT A SINGLE-ISSUE CANDIDATE AND THIS  IS NOT A SINGLE-ISSUE COUNTRY. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN DO ALL PARTS OF THE JOB ON BEHALF  OF ALL AMERICANS WHO BELIEVES IN THE BASIC PROPOSITION ABOUT OUR COUNTRY. THEN WHEN EACH AND EVERY AMERICAN HAS A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO THEIR OWN GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL, THEN AND ONLY THEN  COULD AMERICA LIVE UP TO ITS POTENTIAL. WITH YOUR HELP, WE CAN BUILD THAT FUTURE TOGETHER. PLEASE, JOIN ME ON MARCH 1. THANK YOU ALL FOR EVERYTHING YOU ARE DOING TO MAKE SURE WE VOTE  WITH CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM AND INTO THE FUTURE THAT WE SHAPE. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.",2016 Humphrey-Mondale Dinner

AND I WANT TO THANK EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU. I STILL LOVE NEW HAMPSHIRE AND I ALWAYS WILL.  HERE'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. NOW WE TAKE THIS CAMPAIGN TO THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR EVERY VOTE IN EVERY STATE. WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR REAL SOLUTIONS THAT MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. WHEN I STARTED THIS CAMPAIGN, I KNEW WE WERE FACING PROFOUND CHALLENGES. THE WAY TOO MANY THINGS WERE GOING JUST WASN'T RIGHT. IT IS IN RIGHT. THE KIDS I MET IN FLINT ON SUNDAY WERE POISONED BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR WANTED TO SAVE MONEY. A GRANDMOTHER HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PAYING RENT AND BUYING MEDICINE BECAUSE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG COMPANY INCREASED THE PRICE 4000%. IT ISN'T RIGHT TO THE CASHIER IS PAID LESS THAN HER SON FOR DOING THE SAME WORK EVEN THOUGH SHE IS BEEN ON THE JOB FOR MANY MORE YEARS. PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO BE ANGRY. THEY ARE ALSO HUNGRY FOR SOLUTIONS. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?  THAT IS THE FIGHTS WE ARE TAKING TO THE COUNTRY. WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S LIVES SO WE CAN ALL GROW TOGETHER? WHO IS THE BEST CHANGE MAKER? I WILL WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT WILL MAKE YOUR LIVES BETTER. SENATOR SANDERS AND I BOTH WANT TO GET SECRET UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY OUT OF POLITICS. CITIZENS UNITED WAS THE WORST SUPREME COURT DECISION IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY. IT WAS ACTUALLY A CASE ABOUT A RIGHT-WING ATTACK ON ME AND MY CAMPAIGN. AN ORGANIZATION TOOK AIM AT ME AND ENDED UP DAMAGING OUR ENTIRE DEMOCRACY. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO FIND ANYBODY MORE COMMITTED TO AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM THAN ME.  WE ALSO AGREE THAT WALL STREET CAN NEVER BE ALLOWED TO ONCE AGAIN THREATENED MAIN STREET. I KNOW HOW TO DO IT.  WHEN I TELL YOU NO BANK SHOULD BE TOO BIG TO FAIL HAS NO EXECUTIVE TO POWERFUL TO JAIL, YOU KNOW I BELIEVE IT. WE NEED TO BUILD A GROWTH AND FAIRNESS ECONOMY. HIGHER WAGES, GOOD PAYING JOBS. A BOLD NATIONAL MISSION TO CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS IN CLEAN ENERGY, MANUFACTURING AND INFRASTRUCTURE. WE NEED TO UNLEASH THE INNOVATION OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. MAKE IT EASIER FOR PARENTS TO BALANCE WORK AND FAMILY. CRACK DOWN ON CORPORATIONS THAT GAME THE SYSTEM. STOP OTHER COUNTRIES FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF US. BUT EVEN ALL THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. WE HAVE TO BREAK THROUGH THE BARRIERS OF BIGOTRY. AFRICAN-AMERICAN PARENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL BE HARASSED AND EVEN SHOT IS OF THE  COLOR OF THEISKIN.  IMMIGRANT FAMILIES SHOULDN'T HAVE TO LIE AWAKE AT NIGHT WORRYING ABOUT A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.  S DELIVERS SOMETHING ALONG OVERDUE, EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN.  HERE IS HOW I SEE IT. A PRESIDENT HAS TO DO ALL PARTS OF THE JOB FOR ALL AMERICANS. TO MAKE SURE NOTHING HOLDS YOU BACK. NOT DEBT, NOT DISCRIMINATION NOT A DECK THAT IS ONLY STACKED FOR THOSE AT THE TOP. THAT HAS BEEN THE CAUSE AND THE WORK OF MY LIFE. MY FAMILY AND MY FAITH TAUGHT ME A SIMPLE CREDO. DO ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN IN ALL THE WAYS YOU CAN FOR ALL THE PEOPLE YOU CAN. THAT IS WHAT CALLED ME TO A LIFE OF SERVICE. MILLIONS OF TEACHERS AND NURSES AND POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS AND MEMBERS OF OUR ARMED SERVICES. THE HEROIC WORK FOR ALL THE REST OF US. WHEN CHILDREN ANYWHERE IN OUR COUNTRY GO TO BED HUNGRY OR ARE DENIED A QUALITY EDUCATION, THAT DIMINISHES ALL OF US. THAT IS WHEN I STARTED MY CAREER AT THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. I WENT UNDERCOVER IN ALABAMA TO FIGHT RACISM IN THE SCHOOLS. THAT IS WHY I WENT TO FLINT MICHIGAN ON SUNDAY.  WHEN PEOPLE ANYWHERE IN AMERICA ARE HELD BACK BY INJUSTICE, THAT DEMANDS ACTION. I BELIEVE SO STRONGLY THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH EVERY FIBER OF OUR BEING THE ARGUMENT FOR CAMPAIGNS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. WOMEN'S RIGHTS, GAY RIGHTS, WORKERS RIGHTS. VOTING RIGHTS. HUMAN RIGHTS ACROSS THE BOARD FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN.  THAT IS WHO I AM, THAT IS WHAT I'VE ALWAYS DONE, THAT IS WHY I AM IN THIS RACE. I KNOW I HAVE SOME WORK TO DO PARTICULARLY WITH YOUNG PEOPLE BUT I WILL SAY AGAIN WHAT I SAID THIS WEEK. EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT SUPPORTING ME NOW I SUPPORT THEM.  I KNOW I HAVE LED A BLESSED LIFE BUT I ALSO KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO STUMBLE AND FALL. SONY PEOPLE IN AMERICA KNOW THAT FEELING. IT IS NOT WHAT YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN THAT MATTERS, IT IS WHETHER YOU GET BACK UP.  MY FRIENDS, PLEASE, JOIN ME IN BUILDING ON THE PROGRESS OF PRESIDENT OBAMA PUSHING FORWARD EVERY SINGLE DAY. TO BREAK DOWN THOSE BARRIERS THAT HOLD US BACK. WE HAVE GOT TO BELIEVE IN THE BASIC PROPOSITION OF OUR COUNTRY. ALL AMERICANS HAVE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED. EVERYBODY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE UP TO OUR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL.  LET ME THANK ALL OF YOU. I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO MY WONDERFUL FAMILY KNOWING THEY ARE BY MY SIDE. HE KEEPS ME GOING EVERY DAY. TO THE THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEERS AND ORGANIZERS WHO CALLED NEIGHBORS AND KNOCKED ON DOORS IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE SNOW. TO EVERYONE WHO WENT TO HILLARY CLINTON.COM.

I APOLOGIZE FOR THOSE OF YOU JUST GETTING IN. I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME BACK THERE BECAUSE I AM THRILLED TO BE HERE TODAY BEFORE THE FIRST IN THE NATION PRIMARY TO MAKE MY FINAL PUSH TO CONVINCE AS MANY GRANITE STATERS AS POSSIBLE TO COME OUT AND VOTE FOR ME TOMORROW.  I DON'T THINK A LITTLE SNOW WILL STOP ANYBODY, DO YOU?  WELL, IT IS A GREAT PRIVILEGE ONCE AGAIN TO BE COMPETING IN THIS PRIMARY, ASKING ALL OF YOU TO CONDUCT THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB INTERVIEW IN THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT IT IS. I KNKOWOW VOTERS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE GIVE PEOPLE A FIRST, SECOND AND SOMETIMES A THIRD LOOK. I THINK EVERYBODY HERE HAS MADE UP THEIR MIND AND YOU ARE COMING TO VOTE FOR ME TOMORROW. I APPRECIATE YOU. I'M GRATEFUL TO YOU.  AS FOR ALL OF THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE STILL DECIDING, STILL SHOPPING, I HOPE I CAN CLOSE THE DEAL BETWEEN NOW AND THE TIME THE POLLS CLOSE. I'M SO GRATEFUL TO MY HUSBAND AND MY DAUGHTER FOR BEING HERE WITH ME. I DO, I DO JUST LOVE HAVING THE CHANCE TO HAVE MY DAUGHTER WITH ME ANY CHANCE I CAN GET. I APPRECIATE THE GREAT HELP SHE GIVES ME AND THE OPPORTUNITY I HAVE TO SEE MY GRANDDAUGHTER WHENEVER POSSIBLE. I ALSO AM REMINDED EVERY TIME I THINK ABOUT HER OR ANY OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE THAT THIS IS WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT. TO ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING ME, I THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.  AND TO ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING MY OPPONENT, I THANK YOU, TOO. I THANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF THIS PROCESS, FOR UNDERSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING INVOLVED IN THE POLITICS OF AMERICA IF YOU WANT THE FUTURE YOU DESERVE. I WILL SAY THIS TO THEM -- YOU MAY NOT SUPPORT ME NOW, BUT I WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT YOU, HAVE YOUR BACK AND WORK TO PRODUCE RESULTS FOR YOU. I'M THRILLED TO HAVE MY HUSBAND HERE BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, NEW HAMPSHIRE MEANS A LOT TO US GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1992 WHEN NEW HAMPSHIRE GAVE BILL A CHANCE TO COME OUT OF HERE WITH MOMENTUM AND HEAD TOWARDS THE NOMINATION. WE HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT. WE HAVE ALSO NEVER FORGOTTEN HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO MAKE THE CHANGES HAPPEN THAT HE TALKED ABOUT IN THAT CAMPAIGN. THERE WERE A LOT OF PLACES IN THIS STATE IN 1992 THAT WERE IN BAD ECONOMIC STATES. A LOT OF FACTORIES BEING CLOSE, PRODUCTION BEING SHIPPED OVERSEAS. THE EMPTY BUILDINGS SOMETIMES OUTNUMBERED THOSE THAT WERE IN USE. SO IT IS A THRILL FOR ME TO GO BACK TO CLAREMONT, FOR EXAMPLE, AND TO SEE THE REVITALIZATION OF THAT TOWN BECAUSE OF A LAW MY HUSBAND PASSED, THE NEW MARKET TAX CREDIT, THEN ENABLED THE PEOPLE OF CLAREMONT TO GET A BETTER SHOT AT A BETTER ECONOMIC FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES. WE CAN ACTUALLY MEET PEOPLE HERE IN THIS STATE WHO KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO TURN THE ECONOMY AROUND BECAUSE THEY EXPERIENCED IT. I ONLY WISH WE HADN'T GOTTEN OFF TRACK IN 2011, BECAUSE HONESTLY I BELIEVE THAT SO MUCH OF THE ANGER, THE INSECURITY, THE FEAR AND WORRY THAT PEOPLE FEEL NOW ABOUT THE ECONOMY, ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOUNG PEOPLE COMING OUT OF COLLEGE WITH DEBT, OR UNABLE TO FIND A JOB THAT REALLY GIVES THEM THE BEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITIES, IT IS RELATED TO THE CHOICES THAT WERE MADE STARTING IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. BAD CHOICES FOR AMERICA, WRONG CHOICES FOR THE ECONOMY. TAKING THEIR EYES OFF THE FINANCIAL MARKET, DEREGULATING AND TURNING A BLIND EYE TO THE MORTGAGE MARKET AND HAVING US END UP IN THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY HAVE GONE THROUGH, WHAT THEY HAVE KNOWN OF OUR COUNTRY STARTING WITH THE HORRIBLE ATTACK ON 9/11, GOING INTO THE GREAT RECESSION -- THERE IS NO WONDER THAT THEY ALONG WITH SO MANY OF US ARE SAYING WAIT A MINUTE, WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. WE CAN DO MORE. WE CAN ONCE AGAIN WITH THIS SHIP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THAT IS WHAT OUR MISSION MUST BE. FOR ME, THIS ELECTION IS A TURNING POINT ELECTION IN SO MANY WAYS. I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE WITH ME WHAT IT IS WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH TOGETHER. IMAGINE AN ECONOMY AGAIN THAT PRODUCES MANY, MANY MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS WITH RISING INCOME, WITH PATHWAYS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR A DANCE ADVANCEMENT. IMAGINE RETURNING MANUFACTURING TO AMERICA BY CHANGING THE TAX INCENTIVES THAT TOO OFTEN NOW IT SENDS IT OVERSEAS. IMAGINE TENDING TO OUR FAILING INFRASTRUCTURE IN WAYS LARGE AND SMALL. I SAW IT FIRST HAND YESTERDAY IN FLINT. THE IDEA THAT ANY CITY IN AMERICA WOULD BE DRINKING POISONED WATER FOR TWO YEARS BECAUSE OF INDIFFERENCE, BECAUSE OF STONEWALLING FROM THEIR GOVERNMENT IS HEARTBREAKING, BUT IT ALSO HAS TO BE MOTIVATING. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND A LOT OF PEOPLE TO PUT THE WORK BUILDING AND MAINTAINING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. NOT JUST WHAT WE CAN SEE IN TERMS OF ROADS AND TUNNELS AND BRIDGES AND AIRPORTS, BUT WHAT IS UNDER THE GROUND. WHAT BRINGS OUR WATER, ENERGY, WHAT TAKES OUR SEWAGE -- THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE GREAT JOBS PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE HAD IN A REALLY LONG TIME. I WAS AT A HAVING BREAKFAST WITH BILL THIS MORNING AND ONE MAN SAID THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE ECONOMY. I WANT TO WORK AGAIN. MORE THAN THAT, WHAT MY KIDS AND MY GRANDKIDS TO WORK. IMAGINE AN ECONOMY THAT ONCE AGAIN PRODUCES THOSE GOOD JOBS. IMAGINE AN ECONOMY WHERE INCOMES ARE RISING AGAIN, NOT STAGNANT, WHERE PEOPLE ARE WORKING HARDER THAN EVER BUT NOT GETTING AHEAD. IMAGINE THAT WE CAN COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE BY GOING RIGHT AT CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY.  THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND SOME COUNTRY WILL BE THE 21ST CENTURY CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER. I THINK THE BEST ODDS ARE GERMANY, CHINA OR US. I WANT IT TO BE US. I KNOW IT CAN BE US. I KNOW WE CAN CREATE THE TECHNOLOGY, THE JOBS AND THE SMALL BUSINESSES, AND EVEN EXPORT. IMAGINE THAT WE MEET MY GOAL OF INSTALLING HALF A BILLION MORE SOLAR PANELS BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM AND ENOUGH CLEAN ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME IN THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS. IMAGINE WHAT THAT WILL DO TO HOW WE ARE ONCE AGAIN THE LEADERS IN THE MOST IMPORTANT GLOBAL CHALLENGE WE FACE. IMAGINE GETTING BACK TO BEING NUMBER ONE IN CREATING SMALL BUSINESSES INSTEAD OF WHERE WE ARE. WE HAVE FALLEN DOWN THE RANKSKSKSKSKSBECAUSE WE ARE NOT PROVIDING CREDIT, NOT PROVIDING THE KIND OF SUPPORT THAT SMALL BUSINESSES NEED. IMAGINE RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE SO PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING FULL-TIME ARE NOT MIRED IN POVERTY BUT HAVE A CHANCE TO GET AHEAD. LET'S IMAGINE FINALLY MAKING SURE WOMEN GET EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK IN AMERICA.  YOU SEE, I THINK THERE IS A LOT WE HALF TO BE AGAINST, TO STOP, TO PREVENT -- THE ABUSE OF POWER, ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL. THE IMPOSITION OF IDEOLOGY. THE REFUSAL TO EXTEND THE RIGHTS OF OUR FELLOW AMERICANS. THERE IS A LOT WE HAVE TO STOP, BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE GOOD THINGS HAPPEN, TOO. WHAT I HAVE JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT WHAT I IMAGINE WE CAN DO TOGETHER, THE REPUBLICANS DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF IT. THEY ARE NOT IN THE JOB CREATION BUSINESS. THEY LEAVE THAT TO THE MARKETPLACE. THAT HAS NOT WORKED SO WELL FOR US. WE NEED THE GOVERNMENT PLAYING AN ACTIVE ROLE. THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN MORE MONEY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE OR MY IDEA OF A NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE BANK. THAT WANT TO TALK ABOUT OR COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT ALL OF THIS ADDS UP TO A PATH FORWARD, A VISION THAT NOT ONLY CAN WE IMAGINE, BUT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THESE CLOSING HOURS OF THIS CAMPAIGN, I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE WHAT YOU NEED AND WANT FOR YOU, FOR YOUR FAMILIES, FOR YOUR COMMUNITY AND WHAT YOU WANT FOR OUR COUNTRY. I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART THAT WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED IF WE HAVE THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP TO SEIZE THE FUTURE JUST LIKE WE HAVE IN THE PAST. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN BY WISHING FOR IT. IT WILL HAPPEN BY WORKING FOR IT.  PARTICULARLY, THAT IS TRUE WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE, BECAUSE I'M PROUD OF THE CAMPAIGN WE HAVE RUN. TRYING TO DRAW DIFFERENCES ON ISSUES BECAUSE OF IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT. WHATEN I THINK OF THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCES, IT HAS TO DO WITH HEALTH CARE. IT WAS CALLED HILLARYCARE BEFORE IT WAS CALLED OBAMACARE ALL THOSE YEARS AGO. WE TRIED REALLY HARD AND WE WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL. THE DRUG COMPANIES, INSURANCE COMPANIES REALLY SPENT A LOT OF MONEY AS THEY SEEM TO DO WHENEVER I'M AROUND TRYING TO PREVENT GOOD THINGS FROM HAPPENING. IT WAS DISAPPOINTING. I SURE FELT AFTER HAVING TALKED TO SO MANY AMERICANS THAT THE DIRECTION WE WERE TRYING TO HEAD WAS RIGHT BECAUSE LOOK AT WHAT WAS GOING ON BACK RENT. THEN. THE INSURANCE COMPANIES CALLED ALL THE SHOTS. IF YOU ARE A WOMAN, YOU PAID MORE THAN A MAN. IF YOU WERE A YOUNG PERSON, THERE IS NO WAY YOU COULD GET INSURANCE AND THERE WERE LIFETIME LIMITS THAT PREVENTED PEOPLE FROM GETTING THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEEDED. AFTER WE WERE UNSUCCESSFUL, I THOUGHT HARD ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO. THERE WERE A LOT OF STORIES THAT I HAD HEARD DURING THE COURSE OF MY WORK BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU ONE. I WAS AT THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN CLEVELAND. I WENT THERE BECAUSE I WAS MEETING WITH PARENTS OF VERY ILL CHILDREN WHO COULD NOT GET INSURANCE. I LISTENED TO THEIR STORIES AND, YOU KNOW, AS A MOM, THEY WERE HARD TO HEAR. ONE MAN SAID, HERE IS WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND -- I HAVE MY OWN BUSINESS. I PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE FOR MY EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES. I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS. NOBODY WILL SELL ME AN INSURANCE POLICY NO MATTER WHAT I OFFER. I SAID, WHAT DID THEY SAY TO YOU? HE SAID, THE LAST CONVERSATION I HAD, I ASKED, I TOLD THEM I CAN AFFORD SOMETHING, ANYTHING THAT COULD HELP A. ME. MAN SAID YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, WE DON'T ENSURE BURNING HOUSES. THIS FATHER WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES JUST SAID THEY CALLED MY LITTLE GIRLS BURNING HOUSES. THAT IS WHY I WENT TO WORK ON THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROGRAM AND WE GOT A BUY THE HOUSE AND SENATE TO PASS IT. WAS EVERYTHING WE WANTED? NO, IT WASN'T EVERYTHING WE WANTED. I OFTEN THINK OF THAT OLD SAYING -- A PERSON WHO REFUSES A HALF A LOAF BECAUSE HE IS NOT OFFERED EIGHT WHOEA WHOLE LOAF HAS NEVER GOTTEN HUNGRY. I WAS THRILLED WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA PASSED AND SIGNED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.  FOR ME, WE HAVE TO BUILD ON THAT. WE HAVE TO DEFEND IT AGAINST THE REPUBLICANS CONTINUING EFFORTS TO REPEAL IT. I HAVE SAID, LOOK, WE ARE GOING TO GET OUT-OF-POCKET COST DEDUCTIBLES DOWN, PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS DOWN. I KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO GET FROM 90% COVERAGE TO 100% COVERAGE, BUT WHAT WE CANNOT DO IS START OVER. WE CANNOT THINK WHAT LOOKS GOOD ON PAPER, AN IDEA, AND SAY WE ARE GOING TO THRUST OUR NATION INTO A CONTENTIOUS DEBATE AND START ALL OVER. IT IS A LOT EASIER TO GET FROM 90% COVERAGE TO 100  % THAN 0% TO 100%. I WILL NOT STOP UNTIL WE GET THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THE WAY IT SHOULD BE, HOW IT WORKS, HOW IT PRODUCES RESULTS FOR PEOPLE BECAUSE I IMAGINE A COUNTRY WHERE WE DO HAVE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. WHERE EVERYBODY CAN AFFORD COVERAGE. WHERE WE FINALLY HAVE DRUG COSTS UNDER CONTROL BECAUSE WE CAN NEGOTIATE WITH THE COMPANY'S WITH MEDICARE AND OTHER INSURERS. I ALSO IMAGINE A TIME WHEN WE WILL HAVE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. WHERE WE WILL HELP PREPARE OUR CHILDREN TO SUCCEED. WHERE WE WILL HAVE THE SERVICES AVAILABLE THAT ARE SO DESPERATELY NEEDED BY THESE KIDS IN FLINT, BUT ARE ALSO NEEDED BY OTHER KIDS AS WELL. WHERE WE WILL WORK WITH OUR TEACHERS AND SUPPORT THEM, NOT SCAPEGOAT THEM, BUT GIVE THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO DO THE BEST JOB THEY CAN DO. IMAGINE WHEN WE GET BACK TO MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AGAIN LIKE IT USED TO BE FOR ALL OF US . I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GOT SO FAR OFF THE TRACK ON AFFORDABLE COLLEGE. TUITION HAS GONE UP 40% IN 10 YEARS. NOTHING ELSE HAS GONE UP THAT HIGH, NO OTHER SERVICE. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? YES, I WANT TO GET COLLEGE AFFORDABLE BY MAKING SURE EVERY YOUNG PERSON CAN ATTEND WITHOUT BORROWING MONEY FOR TUITION, BOOKS AND FEES, BUT I ALSO WANT TO GET THE COST DOWN BECAUSE IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE. SO, MY PLAN ASKS SOMETHING FROM EVERYBODY. I WANT STATES TO QUIT BUILDING SO MANY PRISONS AND START BUILDING MORE COLLEGES AND SUPPORTING HIGHER EDUCATION AGAIN.  I WANT FAMILIES AND YOUNG PEOPLE ONLY TO AFFORD WHAT THEY CAN, THAT IS WHY I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF TOTALLY FREE COLLEGE BECAUSE FRANKLY, DONALD TRUMP SHOULD PAY FOR HIS KIDS TO GO TO COLLEGE.  I ALSO DON'T WANT TO TELL THE COLLEGES YOU HAVE A GIVEN TEETH OF MONEY SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE COST. THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP UP WITH. I EXPECT YOUNG PEOPLE TO WORK 10 HOURS A WEEK BECAUSE I THINK BEING INVESTED IN YOUR COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A GOOD COMMITMENT. BUT, WE ARE ALSO GOING TO GET THE DEBT UNDER CONTROL. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE -- I HEAR FROM EVERYWHERE I GO -- THAT BORROW MONEY TO GO TO COLLEGE, BUT NOW THEY ARE OWING THREE TIMES AS MUCH BECAUSE OF INTEREST. I BORROWED MONEY, BUT I BORROWED IT AND ONLY HAD TO PAY BACK THE PRINCIPAL. I BORROWED IT AND I SAID, OK, I WILL PAY IT BACK AS A PERCENTAGE OF MY INCOME WHICH IS WHY WENT TO THE CHILDREN DEFENSE FUND. THAT IS WHAT I WANT FOR EVERYBODY. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. WE WILL MOVE YOU OFF THE HIGH INTEREST RATES THAT TOO MANY OF YOU HAVE. WE WILL MOVE YOU INTO THE INCOME CONTINGENCY PLAN TO CAN PAY AS A PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME. WE ARE GOING TO TRIPLE THE NATIONAL SERVICE POSITION"" THE AND DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF THE GRANT. SO EVERY PERSON CAN AFFORD TO GO TO COLLEGE. WHEN YOU GRADUATE, YOU WILL NOT BE BANKRUPT. YOU CAN GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE LIKE SO MANY OF US HAD THE CHANCE TO DO. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE SOME MORE YOUNG PEOPLE GET THE SKILLS AND CREDENTIALS THEY NEED TO GET ON THE PATH TO A LIFE OF OPPORTUNITY. IMAGINE THAT WE WILL BE BACK DOING WHAT WE SHOULD BE -- INVESTING IN OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND I WILL AND THE PRACTICE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAKING MONEY OFF OF LENDING MONEY TO YOUNG PEOPLE. THAT IS GOING TO BE OVER. AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE ON THE ABUSES IN THESE LOAN COLLECTORS, THESE COMPANIES WHO ARE HARASSING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. THEY ARE EVEN HARASSING OUR VETERANS. WE NEED TO STOP THIS. THIS SHOULD NOT BE A PROFIT-MAKING CENTER FOR ANYBODY. THIS IS AN INVESTMENT IN INDIVIDUALS AND OUR NATION AND THAT IS WHAT IT WILL BE AGAIN.  NOW, I DO HAVE A PRETTY ACTIVE IMAGINATION SO IMAGINE, IMAGINE THAT WE FINALLY MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT NO SPECIAL INTERESTS, NO POWERFUL INTEREST IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO CALL THE SHOTS BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED EITHER BY THE SUPREME COURT OR CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.  WE ARE GOING TO IMAGINE A TIME WHERE WE GET TO GO BACK TO PUBLIC FINANCING. SO ALL THESE QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT EVERYBODY IN POLITICS CAN BE PUT TO REST, BECAUSE YOU DESERVE TO KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING TO SERVE YOU ASARE PUTTING YOU AT THE CENTER OF THEIR ATTENTION AND THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE THEIR ULTIMATE EMPLOYER. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO GET BACK TO. WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE LOOK AT VOTING, WE REGISTER EVERY 18-YEAR-OLD IN THE COUNTRY TO VOTE AUTOMATICALLY. IMAGINE A TIME WHERE WE END DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY SO THAT --  SO THAT, OUR FELLOW AMERICANS CAN BE JUST AS INVOLVED AS EVERY WALK OF LIFE AS ANYBODY ELSE. NOW YOU CAN GET MARRIED ON SATURDAY AND GET FIRED ON MONDAY. THAT IS NOT RIGHT. IMAGINE THAT WE FINALLY GET COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP THAT WILL ADD TO OUR ECONOMY RIGHT NOW. IT WILL RISE ANOTHER $20 BILLION IF WE GET ON THE PATH OF CITIZENSHIP. IT WILL TAKE PEOPLE OUT OF THE SHADOWS SO THAT THERE IS NO MORE EXPLOITATION OF ANYBODY'S LABOR. IMAGINE THAT WE FINALLY, ONCE AND FOR ALL, END THE EFFORTS OF THE REPUBLICANS TO PRIVATIZE SOCIAL SECURITY AND INSTEAD WE LOOK FOR WAYS TO EXTEND THE LIFE OF THE TRUST FUND. IMAGINE THAT WE ALL PAY MORE ATTENTION TO FIXING THE V A.A. T HAN TRYING TO PRIVATIZE IT LIKE THE KOCH BROTHERS AND REPUBLICANS WANT TO DO.  IMAGINE THAT WE DO GET THE KIND OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM THAT OUR PEOPLE DESERVE. BEING EQUAL ON THEIR TO LAW SHOULD NOT JUST BE A SLOGAN, IT SHOULD BE A REALITY. IMAGINE THAT WE END THE ERA OF MASS INCARCERATION AND PROVIDED OF JOBS AND HOUSING AND OPPORTUNITIES IN COMMUNITIES WHEREVER THEY ARE THAT ARE DISTRESSED AND BEHIND. IMAGINE THAT FINALLY WOMEN NOT ONLY GET EQUAL PAY, BUT OUR RIGHTS TO MAKE HER OWN DECISION ARE FINALLY RESPECTED.  IMAGINE THAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD COULD ACTUALLY TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO FEND OFF LAWSUITS AND PARTISAN ATTACKS.  IMAGINE THAT WE FINALLY GET COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY REFORM.  YOU KNOW, I WAS INTERVIEWED -- A BUNCH OF INTERVIEWS TODAY, A LOT OF LOCAL PRESS -- SOMEBODY SAID YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT GUN SAFETY. IS THAT REALLY A VOTING ISSUE? I SAID I HOPE SO BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE ARE 33,000 PEOPLE A YEAR DIEYING. I KNOW WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. I KNOW WE CAN DO THIS CONSISTENTLY WITH THE RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS COMES ADDITIONAL RIGHTS. -- CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. YOU TALK ABOUT LOBBIES IN THIS CAMPAIGN. THE MOST POWERFUL LOBBY BY FAR IS THE GUN LOBBY. THEY INTIMIDATE MORE LEGISLATORS. THEY CALL THE SHOTS ON MORE LEGISLATORS. THEY ACTIVELY WORK TO DEFEAT LEGISLATORS WHO STAND UP AGAINST THEM. THEY TRY TO CONTROL CONGRESS, GOVERNORS. I AM TELLING YOU, FOLKS, WE CANNOT LET ANY LOBBY, WE CANNOT LET MONEY UNELECTED FORCE FOR MONEY, GUNS, DRUGS, OIL, INSURANCE, YOU NAME IT -- THEY CANNOT CONTROL OUR GOVERNMENT ANY LONGER.  THIS IS ONE OF THE POINTS I WANT YOU TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS. SENATOR SANDERS AND I SHARE A LOT OF THE SAME GOALS. I THINK THAT HAS MADE FOR A VERY GOOD CONTEST IN THIS CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE REALLY TRIED TO KEEP IT ON THE ISSUES COMPARED TO REPUBLICANS WERE MOSTLY ENGAGING IN INSULTS ALL THE TIME. THERE ARE DIFFERENCES. IT IS IMPORTANT YOU UNDERSTAND THOSE DIFFERENCES. I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OUT AGAINST AND WORKING TO REIGN IN POWERFUL FORCES FOR MANY YEARS. I HAVE THE SCARS TO PROVE THAT. THEY HAVE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY AGAINST ME. I WANT PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT THIS -- IMAGINE, IF WALL STREET WERE SO INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING DEMOCRATS LIKE THE PRESIDENT AND LIKE ME FOR THEIR OWN REASONS, WHY ARE THEY SPENDING $6 MILLION TRYING TO DEFEAT ME IN THIS PRIMARY? I WILL TELL YOU WHY BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THIS. I HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION. I HAVE CALLED THEM OUT. I HAVE GONE TO WALLSTREAKBY PRESIDENT OBAMA, I HAVE DONATIONS. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD A LOT OF REGULATIONS. DID THAT STOP HIM FROM SIGNING DODD-FRANK? I WAS AMUSED THE OTHER DAY. SENATOR SANDERS TOOK $200,000 FROM A WALL STREET FIRM, NOT DIRECTLY, BUT TO THE SENATE CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE. THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. IT DID NOT CHANGE HIS VIEW. IT DID NOT CHANGE MY VIEW FOR MY VOTE EITHER. SO THAT THEY LEAVE YOU -- SO LET ME LEAVE YOU WITH THIS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHO HAS PUT OUT THE TOUGHEST PLAN, WHO HAS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO MAKING SURE WALL STREET NEVER WRECKS MAINSTREET AGAIN, WHICH HAS IN TURN A  ENCOURAGED TO WALL STREET TO GANG UP AGAINST ME, I TAKE THAT AS A BADGE OF HONOR. I WILL TAKE THEM ON AND I KNOW HOW TO BEAT THEM AND PREVENT THEM FROM EVER DOING TO US AGAIN WHAT THEY DID IN 2008. SO WE HAVE GOT WORK TO DO. IMAGINE A TAX SYSTEM THAT GOES AFTER WHERE THE MONEY IS, AT THE TOP. IMAGINE THE ONLY CANDIDATE ON EITHER SIDE THAT SAID I WILL RAISE YOUR INCOME, NOT MORE TAXES. MIDDLE-CLASS TAXES FAMILIES WILL NOT HAVE AN INCREASE WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, BUT I AM GOING OUT AFTER THE MILLIONAIRES, THE MONEY TO THE BAHAMAS, BERMUDA. IMAGINE THAT WE CAN ONCE AGAIN BELIEVE THAT IT TRULY IS A GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHAT WE MUST IMAGINE AND CREATE TOGETHER. AND IMAGINE THAT WE HAVE ON DAY ONE SOMEONE PREPARED AND READY TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY, TO KEEP OUR FAMILIES SAY, TO BE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF, TO PROTECT THE MEN AND WOMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES AS WELL. IMAGINE THAT AS WE FACE NEW CHALLENGES EVERY DAY, WE DO NOT EVEN KNOW FROM WHERE, AND AS PART OF THIS JOB INTERVIEW, YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHO WILL BE IN THAT WHITE HOUSE ON GENERATE JANUARY 20, 2017.  LET ME AT WITH SOME THANK YOUS. I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE, ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUPPORTED ME. I WANT TO THANK YOUR AMAZING CE SENATOR, JEANNE SHAHEEN. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THEIR SUPPORT. I WANT TO THANK MARTY WALSH, INCREDIBLE MAYOR FROM BOSTON. AND A OF THE LOCAL OFFICIALS WHO ARE HERE. I WANT TO THANK OUR FRIENDS OF VERMONT, THE GOVERNOR OF VERMONT, THE SENATOR FROM VERMONT, THE FORMER GOVERNORS OF VERMONT WHO ARE SUPPORTING ME. THEY ARE SUPPORTING ME BECAUSE THEY KNOW ME. THEY KNOW MY OPPONENT, TOO, THAT IS TRUE, BUT THEY ARE SUPPORTING ME BECAUSE THEY CAN IMAGINE WITH ME AS OUR PRESIDENT, WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THESE THINGS DONE. WE CAN MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLES'S LIVES, BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY, THAT IS WHAT THIS JOB SHOULD BE ABOUT. ARE PEOPLE GOING TO BE BETTER OFF WHEN I FINISH THAN WHEN I STARTED? IS OUR COUNTRY GOING TO BE STRONGER AND COMING TOGETHER INSTEAD OF WEAKER AND FALLING APART? IS OUR ECONOMY TO BE PRODUCING MORE JOBS OR MORE STAGNATION WHERE PEOPLE FEEL THEY ARE SLIPPING BACK? THAT IS THE QUESTION WE ALL HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES. BEING IN FLINT YESTERDAY FOCUSED MY MIND ON WHAT WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IN AMERICA. IT IS HARD TO SQUARE WHAT I KNOW AND LOVE ABOUT MY COUNTRY WITH WHAT HAPPENED THERE. THAT IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE IT HAS HAPPENED. IT IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT AND ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND. IT IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE BREATHING DIRTY ERROR AND DRINKING DIRTY WATER. IT IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE THAT HAS LOST JOBS IN THE PAST AND HAS NO HOPING GETTING JOBS THE FUTURE. THAT IS WHAT MOTIVATES ME. THAT IS WHAT I CARE ABOUT, MAKE SURE TOGETHER WE IMAGINE AND THEN WE CREATE THE COUNTRY THAT IS WORTHY OF ALL THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE AND ONE THAT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN DESERVE TO INHERIT. PLEASE CAN OFTEN HELP ME. COME OUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH, NEW HAMPSHIRE!    ","Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton Rally in Manchester, New Hampshire"

THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK HERE AT FORT SMITH, GREAT BAY, TO HAVE THIS CHANCE TO BE HERE BEFORE YOU WITH MY FRIENDS. I AM THRILLED TO HAVE AL FRANKEN HERE. IT IS SATURDAY NIGHT, AND HE IS LIVE RIGHT HERE IN PORTSMOUTH. I AM SO PROUD OF YOUR GOVERNOR AND SO EXCITED ABOUT HER JOINING THE SENATE. WITH YOUR HELP, MAGGIE, THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND ALL THAT YOU ARE DOING. THANK YOU. I AM ALSO REALLY GRATEFUL TO  HAVE JEANNE SHAHEEN'S SUPPORT. AS SHE WAS TALKING TOWARDS THE END ABOUT THE NEED TO REALLY CONSIDER THAT YOU ARE VOTING FOR BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF, I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE PORTSMOUTH SHIPYARD. I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE NATIONAL GUARD BASE AND HOW MUCH THIS COMMUNITY HAS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE AND SECURITY. AND I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF PORTSMOUTH AND NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR THAT.   WE ARE GETTING DOWN TO THE POINT BEFORE THE FIRST IN THE NATION PRIMARY WHEN I SEE CROWDS LIKE THIS, WHEN I GO DOOR TO DOOR, AS I DID IN MANCHESTER, OR STOP AT A RESTAURANT, WHERE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS PROCESS HAS REALLY GRIPPED THE PEOPLE OF  THIS STATE. YOU HAVE THE FIRST IN THE NATION PRIMARY FOR A REASON. GRANITE STATERS PAY ATTENTION. YOU FOLLOW THIS, YOU CARE ABOUT IT. YOU GIVE A CANDIDATE A FIRST LOOK, MAYBE A SECOND, THIRD,  EVEN A FOURTH. BECAUSE YOU WANT TO GET IT RIGHT, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR VIEWS OR HOW YOU THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE. YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, AND WE ARE THE BETTER FOR IT. I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE SUPPORT THAT I HAVE GOTTEN IN THIS STATE, FOR THE WONDERFUL EXPERIENCES BILL AND I HAVE HAD  GOING BACK TO 1992. THE FRIENDS WE HAVE MADE, HOW WE HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW THIS STATE. TO PARAPHRASE DANIEL WEBSTER, IT  IS A SMALL STATE, BUT THERE ARE THOSE THAT LOVE IT, INCLUDING ME. BEING HERE AS WE MOVE TOWARDS THE TUESDAY PRIMARY IS A GREAT PRIVILEGE. I WANT YOU TO THINK FOR A MINUTE  ABOUT WHAT THIS ELECTION SHOULD BE ABOUT. IT SHOULD BE ABOUT ALL OF US DECIDING WHAT KIND OF FUTURE DO  WE WANT FOR OURSELVES, OUR FAMILIES, OUR COMMUNITIES, AND OUR DEAR COUNTRY. I KNOW THERE IS A LOT OF ANGER, VENTING AND FRUSTRATION, AMONG PEOPLE TODAY. AND I GET IT. THINGS NEED TO BE BETTER. WE NEED TO GET OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM WORKING, GET OUT OF THE GRIDLOCK, START ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES AND SOLVING PROBLEMS AGAIN.   THAT IS, INDEED, WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE. EARLIER TODAY IN CONCORD, I WAS WITH ONE OF OUR GREAT SENATORS SUPPORTING THE, THE SENATOR FROM  NEW JERSEY, CORY BOOKER. CORY WAS TALKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT GENERATION AFTER  GENERATION OF AMERICANS HAVE HAD  TO FACE. HE WENT ALL THE WAY BACK TO  GEORGE WASHINGTON. HE SAID, YOU KNOW, GEORGE WASHINGTON GOT DRIVEN OUT OF NEW YORK BY THE BRITISH AND HAD TO  GO TO NEW JERSEY TO RECONSIDER HOW HE WAS GOING TO GET BACK. WE HAVE ALWAYS FACED OBSTACLES. WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD CHALLENGES. WHAT SETS US APART IS OUR BELIEF IN THE FUTURE. THAT WE ARE, AS AL SAID, BETTER WHEN WE ARE ALL BETTER. THAT IS WHY WE CONTINUE TO WIDEN  THE CIRCLE OF OPPORTUNITY AND RIGHTS. WHY WE KEEP MOVING TOWARDS THAT  PERFECT UNION KNOWING THERE IS  NO PERFECTION, JUST THE JOURNEY. THE IMPETUS TO KEEP DOING BETTER EVERY SINGLE DAY. I SAID LAST NIGHT IN MANCHESTER THAT MY HUSBAND AND I THINK A LOT ABOUT THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE YESTERDAYS THAN TOMORROWS IN OUR LIVES. BUT I'VE LOOKING OUT THERE AND SEE SO MANY OF YOU WITH MORE TOMORROWS. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TOGETHER IS IMAGINE WHAT THAT TOMORROW CAN  AND SHOULD BE. IMAGINE THAT TOMORROWS -- THE TOMORROWS WHERE WE WILL HAVE MORE GOOD QUALITY JOBS WITH RISING INCOME, WHERE PEOPLE WILL BE WORKING TO FIX AND BUILD THE  INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED FOR A  COMPETITIVE ECONOMY, WHERE ADVANCED MANUFACTURING WILL ONCE AGAIN BE GIVEN THE INCENTIVE TO  COME BACK TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AND AMERICA, WHERE WE WILL COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE BY BECOMING A  CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER. NOT GERMANY, NOT CHINA. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.   IMAGINE THE TOMORROWS WHERE SMALL BUSINESSES  WILL BE GROWING AGAIN. WHERE THE MINIMUM WAGE WILL NO LONGER BE A POVERTY WAGE, WHERE  WOMEN WILL FINALLY GET EQUAL PAY  FOR OUR WORK.   I APPRECIATE THE  SIGN ABOUT BELIEVING IN ME, BUT ULTIMATELY, I BELIEVE IN YOU.  I BELIEVE IN US. I BELIEVE IN WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF DOING TOGETHER. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY WAY WE CAN MAKE THOSE TOMORROWS WHAT WE IMAGINE THEY CAN BE IS BY DECIDING WE ARE GOING TO COME TOGETHER, FIND WAYS TO WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER, AND CREATE THE FUTURE THAT OUR CHILDREN AND WE DESERVE. I GET THE ANGER. I GET THE FRUSTRATION. BUT ANGER IS NOT A PLAN, AND VENTING IS NOT A STRATEGY.     ONCE WE EXPRESS OUR DISAPPOINTMENT AND OUR DETERMINATION, THEN WE HAVE TO  ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES. AND AS YOU HEARD FROM THE GOVERNOR, AS YOU HEARD FROM THE TWO SENATORS, WE HAVE WORK TO DO. IMAGINE THE TOMORROW WHEN WE FINALLY GET TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. 100% OF ALL AMERICANS ABLE TO AFFORD QUALITY HEALTH CARE.   IMAGINE WHEN WE HAVE REINED IN THE PREDATORY  PRICING OF DRUG COMPANIES SO  THEY CANNOT RIP OFF PATIENTS ANY LONGER. IMAGINE WHEN WE TAKE MENTAL HEALTH AS SERIOUSLY AS EVERY OTHER KIND OF HEALTH PROBLEM.   IMAGINE WHEN WE HAVE ENOUGH TREATMENT FOR EVERY ADDICTED PERSON WHO WANTS TO GET INTO RECOVERY AND GET ON WITH LIFE.   IMAGINE WHEN WE  TAKE SERIOUSLY ALZHEIMER'S AND  AUTISM AND OTHER CONDITIONS THAT  WE CAN HELP FAMILIES WITH AND GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE A BETTER FUTURE.   ALL OF THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS NOT JUST POSSIBLE. IT IS DOABLE.  IT IS WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. EVERYTHING I HAVE JUST SAID THE REPUBLICANS DISAGREE WITH. THEY DO NOT HAVE A JOBS PROGRAM. THEY WANT TO TAKE US BACK TO TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS. IF FAILED NOT ONCE, NOT TWICE, BUT THREE TIMES. AND THEY WANT TO IMPOSE IT  AGAIN. THAT IS THEIR POLICY. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. THEY ALSO DO NOT BELIEVE IN RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE OR EQUAL PAY. AND THEY WANT TO REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS  OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND OF PRESIDENT OBAMA WE HAVE EVER  HAD.   THAT IS WHY I SO STRONGLY SUPPORT IT. AND I WANT TO MAKE IT BETTER. AND WHY I WILL NOT LET THE REPUBLICANS REPEAL IT AND WHY I THINK IT WOULD BE A GRAVE ERROR  TO START OVER AGAIN AND TRY TO ACHIEVE 100% COVERAGE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.   YOU KNOW, IT IS SO  INTERESTING TO ME. SENATOR SANDERS AND I SHARE MANY OF THE SAME GOALS. WE KNOW WE HAVE TO GET THE ECONOMY WORKING FOR EVERYBODY. IT IS TILTED TOWARDS THE TOP. THAT IS NOT THE WAY WE SUCCEED TOGETHER. I WANT YOU TO FEEL YOUR HARD WORK WILL BE REWARDED. WE HAVE TO CHANGE DIRECTION, REIN IN THE SPECIAL INTERESTS. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WALL STREET NEVER WRECKS MAINSTREET  AGAIN, AND WE WILL.   BUT SETTING THE GOALS IS AN ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP. BUT IT IS JUST THE BEGINNING. IT IS THE BEGINNING. I WILL GET TO THAT, BUT DO NOT BLOCK OTHER PEOPLE. COME ON, BE RESPECTFUL. WE WILL GET THERE. EVERYONE HAS AN ISSUE, I LOVE IT. THANK YOU. BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS FIGURE OUT HOW WE CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS. WE HAD A LITTLE BACK AND FORTH IN THE DEBATE THE OTHER NIGHT ABOUT BEING A PROGRESSIVE. I DO NOT KNOW. MAYBE I AM SORT OF SIMPLE ABOUT THIS. I THINK A PROGRESSIVE IS SOMEONE WHO MAKES PROGRESS.   AND FOR ME, THERE IS SO MUCH PROGRESS TO BE MADE. BUT WE DO NOT START BY TEARING DOWN THE PROGRESS WE HAVE ALREADY MADE. WE NEED TO KEEP AND FIGHT FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND MAKE IT BETTER. WE NEED TO TAKE ON THOSE INTERESTS THAT ARE UNDERMINING THE QUALITY OF CARE AND THE PRICE OF CARE, AND WE WILL. WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE AN ENERGY POLICY THAT MOVES ON FROM FOSSIL FUEL TO CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY AS QUICKLY AS THAT IS POSSIBLE.   THAT IS WHY I HAVE SET SOME BIG GOALS. I WANT US TO HAVE A HALF BILLION  MORE SOLAR PANELS INSTALLED BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM, ENOUGH TO POWER EVERY HOME IN AMERICA IN EIGHT YEARS.   WHEN I THINK ABOUT TOMORROW, I THINK ABOUT STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF SO MANY WHO HAVE COME BEFORE. PEOPLE WHO HAVE SACRIFICED, WHO HAVE WORKED, WHO HAVE GIVEN THE IR ALL TO MOVE OUR COUNTRY INTO  THE FUTURE WITH CONFIDENCE, WITH OPTIMISM, WITH BROAD-BASED  PROSPERITY AND WITH THE EXPANSION OF OUR RIGHTS. AT THE ROOT OF THAT IS EDUCATION. AND I KNOW WE HAVE SOME TEACHERS  AND RETIRED TEACHERS HERE. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WANT TO BE YOUR PARTNER. I WANT TO SUPPORT TEACHERS, NOT SCAPEGOAT TEACHERS. I WANT TO BE SOMEONE WHO WORKS  WITH YOU TO EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN. AND I WANT TO IMAGINE A TOMORROW WHERE WE HAVE ENOUGH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SO EVERY SINGLE CHILD IS PREPARED TO GO TO SCHOOL AND ACHIEVE.   AND I IMAGINE A TOMORROW WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD TO GO TO COLLEGE AND NOT COME OUT WITH SO MUCH DEBT THAT YOU CANNOT GET ON WITH YOUR  LIFE.   YOU KNOW, I THINK ABOUT THIS COLLEGE ISSUE ALL THE TIME. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE EVER HAD STUDENT DEBT? I DID, OK? I MEAN, IT USED TO BE YOU WOULD  HAVE STUDENT DEBT, YOU WOULD PAY  IT OFF, YOU WOULD GO ON. WHEN I BORROWED MONEY, I DID NOT HAVE A BIG INTEREST RATE ON IT. I WAS ABLE TO PAY IT OFF. TOOK A WHILE, BUT I DID IT. SO DID IT -- MY HUSBAND. I WAS JUST ACT NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE AND ASKED ABOUT STUDENT DEBT. I ASKED IF KIDS KNEW WHAT KIND OF INTEREST RATE THEY HAD. A MAN RAISED HIS HAND AND SAID  8%. A YOUNG WOMAN SAID 11%. THERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WHEN WE ARE MORTGAGING THE FUTURE OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND WE ARE NOT GIVING THEM THE RESOURCES YOU NEED TO GET YOUR EDUCATION.   WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AFFORDABLE COLLEGE, DEBT FREE TUITION. WE ARE GOING TO PAY DOWN THOSE DEBTS.  WE ARE GOING TO READ IT --  REFINANCE THEM. I WANT PEOPLE TO GET OUT OF HIGH-INTEREST DEBT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING TO BE MAKING A PROFIT OFF OF LENDING MONEY TO OUR STUDENTS ANYMORE.   THERE IS SO MUCH WE CAN IMAGINE TOGETHER. THEN WE CAN GET TO WORK TO MAKE IT REAL. THAT IS WHAT I CARE ABOUT. AT THE END OF THE SPEECHES, THE END OF THE VOTING, THE WAY I WANT TO BE JUDGED IS, ARE YOU BETTER OFF WHEN I STOP THAN WHEN I START? IS OUR COUNTRY BETTER OFF? ARE WE GROWING TOGETHER OR  SPLITTING APART? ARE WE REACHING OUT, ONE TO THE OTHER, TO FIND WAYS TO LIFT PEOPLE UP? WHEN YOU RUN FOR PRESIDENT, IT CAN BE EXHAUSTING. IT IS AN ENDURANCE TEST, ALL THE  THINGS YOU READ ABOUT. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED EXPERIENCES I CAN IMAGINE. BECAUSE IN SHORT ENCOUNTERS WITH PEOPLE, THEY SOMETIMES TELL YOU THE MOST PERSONAL THINGS, JUST WANTING YOU TO KNOW, HERE IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN MY LIFE. HERE IS WHAT I WANT THE NEXT PRESIDENT TO DO. CAN YOU DO ANYTHING? WHEN I WAS CANVASSING MANCHESTER , A YOUNG MAN CAME UP TO ME AND SAID, I AM SUPPORTING YOU.  I SAID, THANK YOU. WHY? BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ADDICTION. I SAID, YOU HAVE A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE? HE SAID, YEAH. I WAS A STUDENT ATHLETE. I GOT INJURED MY SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL. I HAD TO HAVE SURGERY. AND I GOT A LOT OF PAIN PILLS, A  LOT OF OPIOIDS. AND I GOT HOOKED. THEN, WHEN THEY CUT THEM OFF, I TURNED TO HEROIN. IT WAS CHEAP. IT WAS READILY AVAILABLE. I SAID, HOW ARE YOU DOING NOW? THE SAID, I AM 2.5 YEARS SOBER. IT IS HARD. EVERY DAY IS REALLY HARD. HE SAID, I WANT A PRESIDENT WHO THINKS ABOUT SOMEBODY LIKE ME. YOU KNOW, I THINK WE ALL WANT A PRESIDENT THAT THINGS ABOUT US. WE WANT A PRESIDENT THAT NOT ONLY THINKS ABOUT THE BIG ISSUES LIKE THE ECONOMY, GOING AFTER THE BAD ACTORS, MAKING SURE THEY DO NOT HURT US ANYMORE. LET'S MAKE US SAFE AT HOME. WE HAVE TO. THAT IS PART OF THE JOB DESCRIPTION. THIS IS REALLY A JOB INTERVIEW THAT I AND THE OTHER CANDIDATES ARE ASKING YOU TO THINK ABOUT HIRING ONE OF US FOR THIS JOB. BUT IN TODAY'S WORLD, WE ALSO NEED A PRESIDENT WHO THINKS ABOUT THOSE ISSUES THAT DO KEEP YOU UP AT NIGHT. THAT YOU WORRY ABOUT. THAT YOU THINK NOBODY ELSE IS REALLY CONCERNED. YOU KNOW, I STARTED MY WORK MANY YEARS AGO WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND, DEALING WITH PROBLEMS LIKE MAGGIE WAS SAYING, KIDS LEFT OUT OF SCHOOL BECAUSE  OF DISABILITIES, OR JUVENILES  INCARCERATED IN ADULT JAIL IN SOUTH CAROLINA. GOING UNDERCOVER IN ALABAMA TRYING TO STOP SEGREGATED ACADEMIES THAT WERE TRYING TO  EVADE THE LAW. WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE LIFE BETTER RIGHT NOW? WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE MANY TOMORROWS AHEAD OF US, THE TOMORROWS THE NEXT PRESIDENT  WILL HAVE A HAND IN HELPING SHAPE, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY THINKING ABOUT WHAT I CAN DO TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE IN YOUR LIFE. YOU KNOW, THE WORK OF MAKING PROGRESS CAN BE FRUSTRATING. CAN BE DISAPPOINTING. I REMEMBER THE DAY WHEN WE LOST THE HEALTH CARE BATTLE IN 1993 AND 1994. BEFORE IT WAS OBAMACARE, THEY CALLED IT ""HILLARYCARE."" WE GOT BEAT. INSURANCE AND DRUG COMPANIES, THEY BEAT US. WHEN YOU GET BEAT, YOU HAVE A  CHOICE. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US GETS KNOCKED DOWN. THE QUESTION IS, ARE YOU GOING TO GET BACK UP? THAT IS AS TRUE FOR A COUNTRY AS IT IS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. ARE YOU GOING TO GET UP AND KEEP MOVING FORWARD?  ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE A  DIFFERENCE?   AND WHAT I KNEW THAT DAY IS THAT I COULD NOT  QUIT. I WAS NOT GOING TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HEALTH INSURANCE. BUT I HAD MET, BY THEN,  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE. YOU KNOW, ONE STORY I COULD NEVER GET OUT OF MY MIND WAS AT A CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN CLEVELAND. I WAS SITTING IN A CONFERENCE ROOM TALKING TO PARENTS WHO HAD VERY SICK CHILDREN, WHO WERE TELLING ME THEY COULD NOT GET INSURANCE. BACK IN THOSE DAYS, YOU HAD A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, YOU WERE OUT OF THE INSURANCE MARKET. THIS ONE MAN SAID TO ME, I AM A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS OWNER. I PROVIDE INSURANCE TO MY EMPLOYEES.  I CANNOT GET INSURANCE FOR MY TWO LITTLE GIRLS, WHO HAVE CYSTIC FIBROSIS. I TELL THEM, I CAN EVEN PAY. I SAID, WHAT DO THEY SAY TO YOU? THE LAST CONVERSATION I HAD, THIS MAN JUST LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND. WE DO NOT INSURE BURNING HOUSES. THE MAN I WAS TALKING WITH HAD TEARS IN HIS EYES. THEY CALLED MY LITTLE GIRL'S ""BURNING HOUSES."" WHEN YOU ARE OUT IN THE ARENA TRYING TO MAKE PROGRESS, IT IS NOT JUST HEART OR HEAD. IT HAS TO BE BOTH. THOSE STORIES IN YOUR HEART IS WHAT GETS YOU UP. I SAID, THIS COUNTRY OF OURS SHOULD INSURE EVERY CHILD, AT THE VERY LEAST. THAT IS WHEN I WENT TO WORK WITH  REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TO  CREATE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH  INSURANCE PROGRAM THAT ENSURED 8  MILLION KIDS.   WAS IT EVERYTHING  THAT WE WANTED? NO, IT WAS NOT. DID IT GIVE PEACE OF MIND AND  GUARANTEED HEALTH CARE TO 8 MILLION CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES?  YES, IT DID. THERE IS THAT OLD SAYING ATTRIBUTED TO DIFFERENT FOLKS IN THE PAST. SOMEBODY SAYS HE WILL NEVER SETTLE FOR HALF A LOAF. IT IS TIME WE SAY WE ARE GOING TO TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY INCH BY INCH, STEP-BY-STEP. WE ARE GOING TO BEAT BACK THOSE  SPECIAL INTERESTS AND FORCES THAT WANT TO HAVE IT ALL FOR THEMSELVES. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE PROGRESS  TOGETHER, DEFEND OUR RIGHTS, AND  WE ARE GOING TO ONCE AGAIN BE THE COUNTRY WE KNOW WE CAN BE. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXTEND ACROSS OUR COUNTRY, IT MAKES ME SO PROUD. REPUBLICANS DO NOT BELIEVE IN NEARLY ANYTHING WE HAVE DONE. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHERE I STAND. I WILL DEFEND A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN HEALTH CARE  DECISION.   I WILL DEFEND PLANNED PARENTHOOD AGAINST THESE  PARTISAN REPUBLICAN  I WILL DEFEND MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND MOVED TO END DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY.  I WILL DEFEND VOTING RIGHTS. I WANT EVERY 18-YEAR-OLD TO BE AUTOMATICALLY REGISTERED TO VOTE.   I WILL MAKE APPOINTMENTS TO THE SUPREME COURT WHO WILL DO WHAT THEY CAN TO OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED.   AND IF THAT CANNOT HAPPEN, I WILL LEAD A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO GET RID OF THAT PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE IN OUR POLITICS. I WILL DEFEND SOCIAL SECURITY AGAINST TED CRUZ AND ALL THE OTHERS THAT WANT TO END IT BY PRIVATIZING IT. I WILL DEFEND THE V.A. WE WILL NOT LET THE KOCH BROTHERS RUN SOME PHONY CAMPAIGN TO PRIVATIZE THE V.A.   I WILL WORK FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND TO END THE ERA OF MASS INCARCERATION. I WILL WORK FOR IMMIGRATION  REFORM WITH A PATH TO  CITIZENSHIP. AND I WILL TAKE ON THE GUN LOBBY TO GET COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY REFORM.   THIS IS VERY  PERSONAL TO ME BECAUSE ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS YOU DO WHEN YOU HAVE HAD THE POSITIONS LIKE I HAVE, YOU GO TO A LOT OF VERY SAD, TRAGIC PLACES. YOU GO TO COLUMBINE. YOU MEET WITH THE PARENTS OF SANDY HOOK VICTIMS. YOU GO TO EMANUEL CHURCH IN  CHARLESTON FOR THE FUNERAL OF THE PASTOR.I HAVE LOST LOVED ONES -- HAVE  LOOKED INTO THE EYES OF THOSE WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES TO GUN  VIOLENCE THAN I CAN BEAR. WE MUST DO IT WE CAN TO SAVE LIVES WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH  CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.  THE LAW I HAVE DRAFTED CLOSES  LOOPHOLES AND ENDS IMMUNITY FOR  MAKERS AND SELLERS. PUTTING PEOPLE ON THE NO-FLY  LIST ON THE PROHIBITED LIST FOR BUYING GUNS THAT IS SUPPORTED BY 92% OF AMERICANS AND 82% OF GUN OWNERS.   SO WE WILL WORK TOGETHER TO PUSH FORWARD AND IMPLEMENT A PROGRESSIVE AGENDA.  AND AROUND THE WORLD, I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE, TO GIVE THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT IS NEEDED FOR OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM AND THEIR FAMILIES, AND TO THANK THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR THE SERVICE THAT THEY PROVIDE. TO TAKE ON A LOT OF THESE REALLY TOUGH ISSUES, AS SENATOR SHAHEEN SAID. I KNOW WE HAVE TO DEFEAT ISIS. WE WILL DO IT. WE WILL DO IT WITHOUT SENDING AMERICAN TROOPS INTO COMBAT IN SYRIA AND IRAQ.  WE WILL DO IT BY LEADING AND AIR COALITION TO SUPPORT SYRIAN FIGHTERS USING TRAINERS AND  SPOTTERS AND OTHERS, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO. THIS IS A THREAT THAT IS NOT JUST OVER THERE. IT IS A THREAT THAT WE KNOW IS HERE AND IS METASTASIZING LIKE A VIRULENT, FAST-MOVING CANCER. WE HAVE TO GO AFTER THEIR FOREIGN FIGHTERS, THEIR PRESENCE ONLINE. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE OUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST TERRORISM IS RIGHT HERE AT HOME. WE NEED TO ALL BE ON THE SAME SIDE, UNITED. AFTER 9/11, ONE OF THE REALLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED WAS A PROGRAM SAYING , IF YOU SEE SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS, REPORT IT. WE WERE UNITED. ALL RELIGIONS, ALL RACES, ALL PEOPLE. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO BE TO DEFEAT THESE TERRORIST THREATS. WHEN I HEAR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES IN SALTING AND DEMEANING AMERICAN MUSLIMS AND MUSLIMS OVERSEAS, IT IS NOT JUST  SHAMEFUL. IT IS DANGEROUS. IT IS A REAL ASSAULT ON OUR COMMON DEFENSE. AND WE CANNOT LET ANYONE HERE AT HOME OR AROUND THE WORLD BELIEVE THAT THOSE CANDIDATES SPEAK FOR US. I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CREATING COALITIONS BECAUSE I PUT THE COALITION TOGETHER TO  OPPOSE THE SANCTIONS ON IRAN, TO DRIVE THEM TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE, TO PUT A LID ON THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS. YOU DO NOT FORM A COALITION WITH MUSLIM NATIONS BY INSULTING THEIR RELIGION. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG.   SO HERE IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I REALLY BELIEVE IN OUR TOMORROWS. I REALLY KNOW THAT THE NATION WE IMAGINE IS WITHIN OUR REACH. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL WORK MY HEART OUT FOR YOU. I WILL FIND COMMON GROUND WHERE IT EXISTS AND STAND MY GROUND WHEN I MUST. I CANNOT DO ANY OF THAT WITHOUT YOU. NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS BEEN VERY KIND TO ME. I KNOW I AM RUNNING AGAINST A NEIGHBOR. AND I KNOW HOW NEIGHBORLY GRANITE STATERS ARE. BUT AS YOU TAKE THE SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH LOOK AT US AS WE MOVE TOWARDS TUESDAY, I HOPE YOU WILL IMAGINE WHO CAN BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF. I HOPE YOU WILL IMAGINE WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. I HOPE YOU WILL BELIEVE THAT WE CAN WAGE AND WIN THE FIGHT FOR THE FUTURE. BECAUSE I SURE DO, AND I NEED YOUR HELP ON TUESDAY. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU SO MUCH.   THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.    I AM ALL FOR IT. I LOVE WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO. WE HAVE TO GET STARTED. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE GOT TO DO. OK? THAT IS WHAT I BELIEVE IN. VERY GOOD. OK. ALL RIGHT.  YOU GOT HERE, I AM SO HAPPY. YOU DID. I AM NOT GIVING UP ON IT.           I WILL DO MY BEST.    THANK YOU SO MUCH.     YOU WILL. WE GOT TO.","Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton Rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire"

THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU RAY MUCH. -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL, I HAVE TO TELL YOU -- I KNEW THAT HERE IN THE GRANITE STATE, A LITTLE SNOW WAS NOT GOING TO DAMPER THE ERA -- THE  SPIRITS OF DEMOCRATS. AND IT REALLY IS IMPOSSIBLE TO  EXPRESS HOW GRATEFUL I FEEL. FOR EVERYTHING THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE HAVE DONE FOR ME, FOR MY FAMILY, FOR OUR COUNTRY OVER THE YEARS. TO PARAPHRASE YOUR NATIVE SON, DANIEL WEBSTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE IS  A SMALL STATE, BUT THERE ARE  THOSE WHO LOVE IT, AND I AM ONE  OF THEM.  YOU KNOW GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1992, YOU OPENED YOUR HOMES AND HEARTS TO US. IN 2008 YOU LIFTED ME UP AND GIVE ME BACK MY VOICE.  YOU HAVE TAUGHT ME AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT THE ONLY DIRECTION THAT MATTERS IN LIFE IS FORWARD. OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS SOME PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED AT THE POLLS THAT SHOW SENATOR SANDERS WITH A BIG LEAD HERE AND SUGGESTED --   YES, THAT IS A FACT. AND SUGGESTED I SHOULD JUST LOOK PAST NEW HAMPSHIRE AND FOCUS ON THE NEXT DATE. -- STATE. WELL, NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS NEVER QUIT ON ME, AND I'M NOT GOING TO QUIT ON YOU.  I AM SO PROUD -- I AM SO PROUD  OF THE CAMPAIGN WE HAVE BUILT  HERE. THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEERS. I KNOW HOW HARD YOU ARE WORKING. ACROSS THE STATE POURING YOUR DREAMS AND DETERMINATION INTO THIS EFFORT, CALLING YOUR NEIGHBORS, KNOCKING ON DOORS IN THE WINTER COLD, GOING TO HILLARY CLINTON.COM, CONTRIBUTE  IN WHATEVER YOU CAN, BECAUSE YOU WANT A PRESIDENT WHO WILL ROLL UP HER SLEEVES AND MAKE A  DIFFERENCE IN YOUR LIVES.  AND THIS ENORMOUS SUPPORT THAT YOU HAVE DEMONSTRATED RANGES  ACROSS THE STATE, MANY DIFFERENT  PEOPLE, MANY DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE. I WANT TO START BY THANKING YOUR EXTRA ORDINARY UNITED STATES SENATOR, JEANNE SHAHEEN.  I LIKE SAYING THIS BECAUSE IT IS  JUST A SMALL WAY OF RECOGNIZING HER HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENTS, BUT SHE IS AS OF NOW, THE ONLY WOMAN IN AMERICAN HISTORY TO HAVE SERVED BOTH AS A GOVERNOR AND A SENATOR.  AND I HOPE -- I HOPE NEXT NOVEMBER, YOU WILL SEND THE SECOND WOMAN TO HAVE SERVED AS A GOVERNOR AND SENATOR, MAGGIE HASSAN TO THE SENATE.  THE SUPPORT AND THE ADVICE OF  THESE TWO REMARKABLE LEADERS MEANS THE WORLD TO ME. I HAVE WORKED WITH THEM. I HAVE SUPPORTED THEM. I HAVE WATCHED WHAT THEY HAVE ACHIEVED IN THEIR PUBLIC  CAREERS. I AM JUST SO GRATEFUL TO NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR LIFTING THEM UP,  AND FOR GIVING THEM THE CHANCE TO LEAD AND TO SERVE. I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ELECTING, AND I KNOW YOU WILL SEND BACK CONGRESSWOMAN AND A CUSTARD TO REPRESENT YOU -- ANNIE CUSTER TO REPRESENT YOU, AND I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU RETURN CAROL SHEA-PORTER TO CONGRESS. BUT IN ADDITION TO THESE WELL-KNOWN PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT ME , WHO HAVE BEEN TRULY AT MY BACK AND SIDE, THERE ARE SO MANY OTHERS. LIKE AVA, AND OVERACHIEVING HIGH  SCHOOL SENIOR IN BERLIN,'S WHO  ALSO WORKS MOST NIGHTS AT HER  FAMILY RESTAURANT. SHE STILL MAKES TIME TO  VOLUNTEER FOR MY CAMPAIGN. WHY? BECAUSE SHE IS SEEN SO -- HOW  MUCH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS MEANT TO HER FAMILY AND THEIR  SMALL BUSINESS, AND SHE DOES KNOWLEDGE OF THE THAT PROGRESS EVER RIPPED AWAY.  OR ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN,  SAMANTHA, WHO WORKS THREE JOBS IN BELMONT, INCLUDING A LOT OF NIGHT SHIFTS. SHE STILL FINDS TIME TO VOLUNTEER FOR ME. SHE IS ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED,  SHE SAYS, TO ELECT A PROGRESSIVE WHO GETS THINGS DONE. AND IF IT MEANS -- IF IT MEANS ALSO BREAKING THE HIGHEST, HARDEST, GLASS CEILING -- THAT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD AS TOO.  I ALSO WANT TO THANK EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL, EVERY LOCAL LEADER, ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF ORGANIZED LABOR, PLANNED PARENTHOOD, THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN, THE LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS, AND EVERY  OTHER PROGRESSIVE ORGANIZATION  WHO ARE WORKING SO HARD FOR MY CAMPAIGN.  NOW ONE THING I KNOW FOR SURE,  IS HOW SERIOUSLY THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE TAKE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS THE FIRST IN THE NATION PRIMARY. I KNOW THAT A LOT OF VOTERS ARE STILL SHOPPING. YOU MAY HAVE A FAVORITE, BUT THIS IS NEW HAMPSHIRE. EVERYONE TAKES A SECOND LOOK. MAYBE EVEN A THIRD OR FOURTH LOOK. I HOPE YOU WILL GIVE ONE OF THOSE LOOKS TO ME IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  I AM GOING TO COMPETE FOR EVERY VOTE HERE. I WILL ANSWER EVERY QUESTION. I WILL WORK MY HEART OUT TO EARN YOUR SUPPORT. IN THIS CAMPAIGN I HAVE LISTENED  TO PEOPLE ACROSS NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND THE COUNTRY. SHARE THE PROBLEMS THAT KEEP THEM UP AT NIGHT, AND SEEM ALWAYS TO STACK THE DECK EVEN MORE FOR THOSE OF THE TOP. PRESCRIPTION DRUG CUBBIES ARE JACKING UP THE PRICE OF DRUGS FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN GREED. I HAVE MET PEOPLE WHOSE BILLS HAVE DOUBLED, EVEN TRIPLED OVERNIGHT. POWERFUL CORPORATIONS ARE HEADING OVERSEAS, FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN TO AVOID PAYING U.S. TAXES, INCLUDING AN AUTO PARTS COMPANY THAT LOBBIED FOR THE RESCUE OF THE AUTO INDUSTRY BACK IN 2008. ALL OF US, ALL OF US TAXPAYERS, WE HELP TO SAVE THEM -- HELPED  SAVE THEM. NOW THEY WANT TO TURN THEIR BACK ON AMERICA. THEY CALL IT AN INVERSION, I  COLLEGE IT A PER VERSION, AND WE HAVE TO STOP IT.  THINK OF THIS -- A GOVERNOR IN STATE GOVERNMENT IN MICHIGAN ALLOWS CHILDREN IN FLINT TO DRINK POISON WATER JUST TO SAVE A BUCK. AS IF THEIR LIVES WERE WERE NOT  WORTH THAT MUCH. AS I SAID SOME WEEKS AGO A,SK YOURSELF, WOULD IT HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY WERE RICH AND WHITE, INSTEAD OF POOR AND BLACK. WE KNOW THE ANSWER, DON'T WE. SENATOR SANDERS AND I AGREE, WE HAVE TO STOP BAD THINGS FROM HAPPENING. BUT I BELIEVE WE HAVE GOT TO START GOOD THINGS HAPPENING AGAIN IN AMERICA.   WE NEED -- WE NEED A BOLD  NATIONAL MISSION TO GET JOBS  GROWING, AND INCOMES RISING SO WORKING FAMILIES CAN GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. WE NEED TO PULL OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER SO THERE IS MORE JUSTICE AND DIGNITY, AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF OUR SENATE -- CITIZENS. WHEN HE TO MEASURE OUR SUCCESS  BY HOW MANY CHILDREN CLIMB OUT  OF PROPERTY, AND HOW MANY FAMILIES WORK THEIR WAY INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS, NOT HOW MANY CEOS GET BONUSES AT THE END OF THE YEAR.  I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT AMERICA CANNOT REACH ITS FULL POTENTIAL WHEN YOU ARE HELD BACK FROM REACHING EUROS -- YOUIRRS. I WANT TO BREAK DOWN ALL OF THE BARRIERS HOLDING AMERICANS BACK  FROM ACHIEVING THEIR DREAMS.  ECONOMIC BARRIERS OF COURSE,  ESPECIALLY THOSE PUT IN PLACE BY GREED. REDUCING INEQUALITY. THE PROBLEMS IN AMERICA CANNOT THE REDUCED TO WALL STREET AND WASHINGTON, AS IMPORTANT AS THE CZAR. -- AS THOSE ARE. WE ALSO NEED TO BREAK DOWN A BARRIERS OF RACISM AND SEXISM AND DISSEMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY. IMMIGRANTS AND PEOPLE WITH HIS ABILITIES -- DISABILITIES.  WE NEED TO TAKE ON THOSE QUIET,  DEVASTATING CHALLENGES OF  ADDICTION AND MENTAL ILLNESS. WE NEED TO HELP FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO CARE FOR LOVED ONES WITH ALZHEIMER'S AND AUTISM. I WANT TO REMOVE THE OBSTACLES STANDING IN THE WAY OF PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT AND LEFT BEHIND FROM  COLD COUNTRY -- COAL COUNTRY TO  INNER CITIES. WHEN EVERY CHILD HAS THE CHANCE TO SUCCEED, AMERICA EXCEEDS. YOU SAW -- SUCCEEDS. YOU SAW IN THE VIDEO WHEN BILL SAID SOMETHING THAT REALLY STUCK WITH ME. HE HAS A WAY OF DOING THAT. HE WAS TALKING TO YOUNG PEOPLE AND HE TOLD HIM -- THEM -- YOU STILL HAVE MORE TOMORROWS IN YOUR LIFE THAN YESTERDAY'S.  AND THOSE OF US WHO HAVE MORE YESTERDAYS THAN TOMORROW'S  BELIEVE IT OR NOT SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE. I CERTAINLY KNOW THAT IS TRUE  FOR ALL OF US WHO ARE GRANDPARENTS BECAUSE THAT REALLY FOCUSES YOUR MIND ON THE FUTURE. AS -- IF I HAVE THE HONOR OF SERVING AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL SPEND ALL OF MY TOMORROW'S DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE YOUR TOMORROW'S BETTER. TO GIVE EVERY ONE OF OUR CHILDREN THE POSSIBILITY AND PROSPERITY THEY DESERVE.   SO, PLEASE, IMAGINE WITH ME,  IMAGINE A TOMORROW WHERE YOUR HEART -- HARD WORK AND REWARDED WITH RISING INCOME. WHERE THE MINIMUM WAGE IS NO LONGER A POVERTY WAGE. WE KNOW YESTERDAY, REPUBLICANS AND CONCORDE SAID NO TERROR RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE. -- SAID NO TO RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE. WELL I KNOW HOW TO GET IT DONE. IMAGINE A TOMORROW WHERE WE PRODUCE ENOUGH RENEWABLE ENERGY  TO POWER EVERY HOME IN AMERICA,  AND CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD JOBS DOING IT. I KNOW HOW TO GET THAT DONE.  A TOMORROW WHERE EDUCATION LIST YOU UP AND STUDENT -- LIFTS YOU UP AND STUDENT DEBT DOES NOT DRAG YOU DOWN. WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHOICES YOU DESERVE, AND WHERE MORE ENTREPRENEURS CAN START AND GROW NEW SMALL BUSINESSES. IMAGINE, IMAGINE A TOMORROW WHERE PARENTS HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE SO THEY DO NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A PAYCHECK AND CARING FOR THOSE BABY -- OR A  BABY OR A SICK RELATIVE. A TOMORROW WHERE WE OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED AND FINALLY GET BIG UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY OUT OF OUR DEMOCRACY.  AND, IMAGINE A TOMORROW WHERE  GUN VIOLENCE NO LONGER STALKS OUR COUNTRY.  AND THE GUN LOBBY CANNOT STAND IN THE WAY OF EVERY COMMONSENSE REFORM. THAT IS THE TOMORROW I WANT FOR US.  FOR A KIDS. FOR A COUNTRY -- OUR COUNTRY. I KNOW HOW TO GET THAT DONE. WE DEMOCRATS FACE A BIG CHOICE ON TUESDAY. I WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE RIGHT NOW TO SPEAK TO ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE.  WHETHER THEY ARE SUPPORTING ME OR SENATOR SANDERS.  NOW OF COURSE I STILL HOPE TO PERSUADE THOSE WHO ARE  SUPPORTING SENATOR SANDERS TO GIVE ME ANOTHER LOOK, BUT, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I AM TRULY GLAD THAT YOU ARE INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS AND IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. YOU ARE BRINGING ENERGY, IDEAS, AND URGENCY TO OUR SHARED CAUSES.  AND I CANNOT HELP BUT THINK ABOUT HOW I FELT WHEN I FIRST CAME TO NEW HAMPSHIRE IN 1968 TO CAMPAIGN FOR MY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, GENE MCCARTHY TO END THE WAR IN VIETNAM.  IN THE FOLLOWING YEARS I WENT ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY, TRYING IN MY OWN WAY TO MAKE THINGS BETTER. I WENT UNDERCOVER IN ALABAMA TO EXPOSE RACISM IN THE SCHOOLS. I DROVE THROUGHOUT SOUTH TEXAS, REGISTERING LATINO VOTERS. I EVEN SHOCKED MY FRIENDS BY  MOVING TO ARKANSAS WITH MY THEN BOYFRIEND BECAUSE WE WERE IN LOVE AND SO FIRED UP TO DO GOOD WORK THERE. AND I LEARNED WHAT YOU ALL ARE  PROVING EVERYDAY. YOU CAN MAKE CHANGE WITHOUT  BEING ELECTED TO ANYTHING. YOU JUST NEED TO GO DO IT. SO I RESPECT -- I RESPECT NOT ONLY YOUR ENTHUSIASM, BUT ALSO YOUR SERIOUSNESS ABOUT HELPING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY WHAT IT CAN AND SHOULD BE. THAT IS WHY I WANT TO TAKE JUST A FEW MINUTES TO MAKE MY CASE  FOR WHY I BELIEVE THAT THIS --  AT THIS TIME I AM THE BETTER CHOICE TO BE A PRESIDENT -- YOUR  PRESIDENT. SENATOR SANDERS AND I SHARE BIG, PROGRESSIVE GOALS FOR OUR COUNTRY. I BELIEVE I HAVE LAID OUT STRONGER PLAN FOR HOW TO ACHIEVE THEM, AND HOW TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVE SOON -- LIVES SOON.  I HAVE HEARD SOME OF THE PUNDITS SAY THAT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR APPROACHES COMES DOWN TO HEAD VERSUS HEART, WILL I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY. FOR ME, IT IS BOTH. WE HAVE HAD A WORTHY DEBATE ABOUT HEALTH CARE IN OUR CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE HAD SUBSTANTIVE  DISAGREEMENTS OVER ISSUES, AS IT SHOULD BE. COMPARE THAT TO THE CAMPAIGN OF INSULTS GOING ON ON THE  REPUBLICAN SIDE. WHEN WE DRAW THESE CONTRASTS WE  DO IT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF BOTH OF US UNDERSTANDING, WE HAVE TO GO TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WE HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHAT WE WANT TO DO, AND HOW WE WILL COME PUSH IT -- ACCOMPLISH IT. I HAVE FOUGHT MY ENTIRE CAREER TO GET QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN.  I KNOW, I KNOW HOW HARD THAT IS. THE INSURANCE LOBBY AND THE DRUG COMPANIES SPEND TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO STOP US. IT WAS DISAPPOINTING. I HAD TRAVELED TO SO MANY PLACES TO MEET WITH SO MANY AMERICANS WHO ARE SO HOPEFUL THAT FINALLY THEY WOULD HAVE HEALTH CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. I HAVE A MILLION STORIES THAT TUGGED AT MY HEART AND MY BRAIN. ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT SUMMED UP FOR ME BUT WAS SO PROFOUNDLY WRONG. IT WAS FROM A VISIT I MADE FROM -- TO THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN CLEVELAND. I WAS SITTING IN A CONFERENCE ROOM, TALKING WITH PARENTS OF VERY ILL CHILDREN. THEY WERE TELLING ME HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO GET THE MEDICAL CARE THEIR CHILDREN NEEDED. ONE MAN SAID, LOOK, I AM SUCCESSFUL. I PROVIDE HEALTH CARE FOR MY  EMPLOYEES OF THE BUSINESS I STARTED. NOBODY WILL SELL ME A POLICY TO ENSURE MY TWO DAUGHTERS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND, I HAVE GONE FROM PLACE TO PLACE, I ASKED  HIM, WHAT DID THEY TELL YOU WHAT YOU SAY YOU HAVE THE MEANS. HE SAID, WILL THE LAST PERSON I SPOKE WITH LISTEN TO ME -- LISTENED TO ME AND SAID, YOU  DON'T UNDERSTAND. WE DON'T ENSURE EARNING HOUSES -- INSURE BURNING HOUSES. THIS MAN GOT TEARS IN HIS EYES. HE SAID, THEY CALLED MY LITTLE GIRLS BURNING HOUSES. WE DIDN'T GET EVERYTHING WE WANT TO, BUT I GOT BACK TO WORK, WENT TO WORK AND WE GOT CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE THAT E INSURES 8 MILLION CHILDREN  TODAY.  THAT PROGRAM -- THAT PROGRAM CAME A LIFELINE FOR THOSE A MILLION KIDS -- 8 MILLION KIDS. AND A SENSE OF SOME SECURITY FOR THEIR FAMILIES. LET ME BE CLEAR, I NEVER GAVE UP  ON THE DREAM OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH  CARE NOT FOR A SECOND. 8 MILLION KIDS WAS CERTAINLY NOT EVERYTHING WE WANTED, BUT IT WAS  REAL. I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD LEAVE CHILDREN  WITHOUT HEALTH CARE, EVEN A SINGLE DAY LONGER THAN WE HAD  TO.  I THINK, BASED ON THE WORK I HAVE DONE OVER SO MANY YEARS  THAT WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE HURTING , YOU SEE THEM BEING TREATED UNJUSTLY, DISCRIMINATED AGAINST, AND YOU WANT TO HELP THEM TO DO SOMETHING THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT YOU CARE, THAT MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE THEIR LIVES A LITTLE BETTER , TRY TO DO IT. IF THAT MEANS A QUIETER SUCCESS, THAT IS FINE. THAT IS WHY I SAY WITH ALL OF MY HEART, LET'S BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT RIGHT NOW. LET'S GET THOSE OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS DOWN. LET'S TACKLE THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. LET'S NOT START A NEW DIVISIVE  DEBATE ABOUT THE SHAPE OF OUR WHOLE SYSTEM THAT WILL JUST LEAD TO GRIDLOCK, AND WILL NOT HELP ANYONE IN THE HEALTH CARE THEY DESERVE.  YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE I HAVE MET IN THIS CAMPAIGN CANNOT WAIT.  THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT. THE YOUNG WAITRESS WHO SPENDS  ALL DAY WORKING IN A RESTAURANT AND ALL NIGHT WORKING IN A FACTORY NEEDS A RAISE. SHE CANNOT WAYS -- WAIT. THE WINDOW I MET WHO HAD LOST HER HOME BECAUSE HER SOCIAL SECURITY AIM IT DID NOT GO FAR ENOUGH DESERVE BETTER. SHE CANNOT WAIT EITHER. THE YOUNG PEOPLE I MEET WHO WANT TO START SMALL BUSINESSES. THE ENTREPRENEURS WHO HAVE DREAMS, THEY NEED OUR HELP AND SUPPORT. PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IN THEM. THEY CANNOT WAIT. WOMEN ACROSS OUR COUNTRY DESERVES EQUAL PAY FOR THE WORK WE DO. THEY CAN'T WAIT.  I DON'T THINK ANY OF US CAN WAIT. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US CAN WAIT. YOU DESERVE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL LISTEN TO YOU, FIGHT FOR YOU.  AND I WILL MAKE PROMISES I CAN'T KEEP. THIS IS THE BIGGEST JOB INTERVIEW IN THE WORLD, MY FRIENDS, AND YOU SHOULD HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE.  I AM A PROGRESSIVE WHO LIKES TO GET THINGS DONE, AND I HAVE LEARNED YOU HAVE TO BE BOTH A DREAMER AND A DOER. YOU HAVE TO PUSH FORWARD EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES. AND I ALSO KNOW A BIG PART OF THE JOB I AM SEEKING IS KEEPING OUR FAMILY SAFE, OUR COUNTRY STRONG, AND OUR TROOPS OUT OF FOUR. -- OUT OF WAR. SO, YOU'RE NOT JUST PICKING A PRESIDENT. YOU ARE CHOOSING A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. AND I KNOW SOMETIMES FOREIGN POLICY MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE REMOTE. THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE WITH THE EVENTS TAKING PLACE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD, BUT THINGS THAT HAPPEN OVERSEAS CAN DIRECTLY IMPACT YOUR LIFE, YOUR JOB, AND YOUR FAMILY. THERE IS TERRORISM, OBVIOUSLY,  BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.  JUST IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS, WE HAVE SEEN PROBLEMS IN CHINA SENDING STOCK MARKETS PLUMMETING. THAT CAN AFFECT YOUR RETIREMENT  SAVINGS. AS WE SIT HERE TONIGHT, NORTH KOREA IS WORKING ON MISSILES THAT COULD REACH THE UNITED STATES. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO  UNDERSTANDS HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT THREAT.  AS WE SIT HERE TONIGHT, OUR  TROOPS ARE STILL IN HARM'S WAY IN AFGHANISTAN. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO CAN GIVE THEM THE SUPPORT AND THE STRATEGY THEY NEED. RUSSIA, IRAN, ISIS, THESE ARE NOT ISSUES THAT WE CAN PUT TO  THE SIDE. THEY CANNOT BE AN AFTERTHOUGHT.  WE HAVE TO BE JUST AS PRESENT ON THE DESK IN THE OVAL OFFICE AS ALL THE OTHER WORK WE NEED TO GET DONE HERE AT HOME. I AM VERY PROUD OF THE EXPERIENCE AND JUDGMENT I WOULD BRING TO THIS JOB.  I HAVE WORKED HARD ON DIPLOMACY. I HAVE SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS ADVISING PRESIDENT OBAMA ON THE HARDEST CHOICES AND THE TOUGHEST CALLS A PRESIDENT EVER HAS TO MAKE. IF PRESIDENT, ANY PRESIDENT, HAS  TO BE ABLE TO DO ALL PARTS OF THE JOB. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED CONFIDENCE THAT YOU CAN KEEP THEM SAFE, GET THE ECONOMY MOVING AGAIN, AND BUILD ON THE PROGRESSIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE HAVE MADE UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA. AND WITH YOUR HELP, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WILL DO. AND LET'S NOT FORGET, THE REAL  GOAL HERE IS TO DEFEAT THE REPUBLICANS, WHOEVER THEY  NOMINATE. AND LET'S FACE IT, THEY ALL DISAGREE WITH PRETTY MUCH ALL OF US BELIEVE IN. THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING TO GIVE WOMEN EQUAL PAY OR HOLD WALL STREET ACCOUNTABLE. THEY WILL DO A LOT TO TURN BACK THE CLOCK ON YOUR RIGHTS. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHERE I  STAND. I WILL PROTECT OUR RIGHTS, CIVIL RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS, WORKERS RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHTS, GAY RIGHTS, THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. I WILL ALWAYS DEFEND PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER HEALTH. -- MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS ABOUT HER HEALTH, AND WHENEVER I SAY THIS, SOME REPUBLICAN WILL SAY I AM PLAYING THE GENDER CARD. WELL, IF STANDING UP FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS, WOMEN'S HEALTH AND EQUAL PAY IS PLAYING THE GENDER CARD, THEN DEAL ME IN. I WILL DEFEND MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND WORK TO END DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY. I WILL STOP THE REPUBLICANS FROM PRIVATIZING SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE, OR THE V.A.. AND I WILL STAND UP TO THE GUN LOBBY, THE MOST POWERFUL LOBBY IN WASHINGTON. BUT HERE IS THE TRUTH. NO CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT HAS  ALL THE ANSWERS AND NO PRESIDENT CAN DO THIS WORK ALONE. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE KNOCKED DOWN. I DOUBT THERE IS ANYBODY WHO HASN'T HAD HARD TIMES IN THEIR LIFE HERE TONIGHT. BUT I LEARNED FROM MY FAMILY AND MY FAITH BUT IT'S NOT WHETHER YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN.  IT'S WHETHER YOU GET BACK UP. AND I BELIEVE THAT NOT ONLY DO WE INDIVIDUALLY HAVE TO GET BACK UP TIME AND TIME AGAIN, BECAUSE  AS LONG AS THERE IS WORK TO DO AND PEOPLE TO HELP, WE CAN'T STOP, I THINK OUR COUNTRY HAS TO GET BACK UP.  I THINK WE HAVE TO ONCE AGAIN  HAVE THE KIND OF CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM THAT IS PART OF THE AMERICAN DNA. WE SET BIG GOALS. WE SUMMON THE BEST OF OUR NATURES. WE WORK TOGETHER AGAIN ACROSS ALL THE LINES THAT DIVIDE US.  EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE, I TRY TO PRACTICE WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED  THE DISCIPLINE OF GRATITUDE. NOW, THAT MEANS NOT JUST BEING GRATEFUL FOR THE GOOD THINGS, BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF EASY. BUT BE GRATEFUL FOR THE HARD THINGS TOO, GRATEFUL EVEN FOR OUR LIMITATIONS, BECAUSE IN THE END, THEY CAN MAKE US STRONGER. THEY CAN GIVE US A CHANCE TO  REACH BEYOND OUR GRASP. THEY CAN ALSO TEACH US THAT WE ARE BETTER TOGETHER WHEN WE WORK TO FIND COMMON GROUND. AMERICA IS FACING A LOT OF CHALLENGES, BUT I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART WE CAN RISE TO MEET THEM. YOU SEE, I BELIEVE IN THE POTENTIAL OF EVERY AMERICAN TO  SOLVE THE TOUGHEST PROBLEMS, TO BE RESILIENT, NO MATTER WHAT  THEY THROW AT US. I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THIS COUNTRY AND FOR ALL OF YOU. IF WE CAN BREAK THROUGH THE BARRIERS THAT HOLD PEOPLE BACK. IF WE CAN UNLEASH THE TALENT AND POTENTIAL OF OUR PEOPLE, THERE ARE NO LIMITS TO WHAT AMERICA CAN IN CHIEF -- CAN ACHIEVE. SO AGAIN, IMAGINE WITH ME AN AMERICA WHERE YOUR WAGES MATCH  YOUR HARD WORK, WHERE COMMUNITIES ARE THRIVING AGAIN, WHERE THERE IS QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE AND  CHILDCARE IS AVAILABLE TO EVERY FAMILY.  WE CAN BUILD THAT COUNTRY. WE CAN MAKE OUR TOMORROWS GREATER THAN ALL OUR YESTERDAYS. I'M FIGHTING FOR THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO CAN'T WAIT. I FIGHTING FOR OUR FAMILIES AND OUR FUTURE. I AM FIGHTING FOR THE AMERICA I KNOW WE CAN BUILD TOGETHER.  AND FOR EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU . THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH.  THANK YOU. GOD BLESS YOU.    ",2016 McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club Celebration

OH, MY GOSH. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU. AND I AM SO THRILLED I AM COMING TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AFTER WINNING IOWA.   I CAN TELL YOU -- I HAVE WON AND LOST THERE. IT IS BETTER TO WIN. AND IT IS A GREAT TRIBUTE TO MY ORGANIZATION AND SUPPORTERS THERE. WE ARE BRINGING ALL THAT ENERGY, EXCITEMENT, DETERMINATION RIGHT HERE TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHERE WE WILL WORK HARD UP UNTIL THE PRIMARY NEXT WEEK.   I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF YOU. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU WHO ARE HERE THIS MORNING TO KICK OFF THIS LAST PHASE OF THE PRIMARY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. AS YOU KNOW, MY HUSBAND AND I ARE PRETTY FOND OF THIS WE HAVE MADE FRIENDS, STARTING BACK TO 1991 WHO HAVE BEEN WITH US YEAR AFTER YEAR. PEOPLE WE CARE ABOUT. PEOPLE WE KNOW ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THIS STATE. I JUST GOT TO GIVE YOUR GOVERNOR A BIG HUG AS SHE WAS HEADING OUT THE DOOR. I AM ABSOLUTELY THRILLED ABOUT HER CAMPAIGN BECAUSE WE NEED HER IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE.   THIS IS AN EXCITING WEEK FOR A LOT OF REASONS. IT IS, AFTER ALL, THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE CHOOSE WHO EACH PARTY WILL NOMINATE FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB IN OUR COUNTRY. AND IT IS UP TO NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS TO WAY AND IN THE FIRST PRIMARY IN THE NATION. AND WE HAVE SEEN THE ARRIVAL AT THE RIGHT TIME FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CONTEST OF IDEAS REALLY IS BETWEEN MY AND MY ESTEEMED OPPONENT, SENATOR SANDERS. I AM EXCITED BY THAT BECAUSE THAT IS THE BEST WAY FOR YOU TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND. WHAT DO WE STAND FOR? WHAT DO WE THINK IT TO BE DONE? HOW DO WE BELIEVE WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER? HOW DO WE MAKE A REALLY DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE PAST LIVES? -- PEOPLE'S LIVES? HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THIS COUNTRY STAYS TRUE TO ITS VALUES? IT GOES AFTER THE INEQUALITY, AND NOT JUST ECONOMIC INEQUALITY. WE HAD TO DEAL WITH RACIAL INEQUALITY. WITH GENDER INEQUALITY. WITH SEXUAL ORIENTATION INEQUALITY. WITH THE POVERTY OF SPIRIT THAT HAS TOO MUCH OVER THE LIVES -- INFLUENCE OVER THE LIVES OF OUR FELLOW AMERICANS. I COME TO YOU WITH A LIFETIME OF ADVOCACY AND SERVICE AND GETTING RESULTS. I'M GRATEFUL BILL WAS HERE BECAUSE HE DOES KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE JOB WE ARE COMPETING FOR. I HAVE TO CONFESS, NOT JUST BECAUSE WE DID MEET 45 YEARS AGO , I AM ALWAYS SURPRISED WHEN I SAY THAT. BECAUSE HE PRODUCED RESULTS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I WANT TO MAKE THIS CASE TO YOU AND I WANT TO ASK YOU, DURING THESE NEXT OF DAYS, TO GO OUT AND TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND COLLEAGUES ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE. IT COULD NOT BE MORE STARK, BETWEEN WHAT I OFFER AND WHAT THE REPUBLICANS OFFER. BETWEEN MY RECORD OF RESULTS AND THEIR EFFORTS TO TURN THE CLOCK BACK ON ALL THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE IN AMERICA. LET ME JUST RUN THROUGH SOME OF THE BASICS. ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS IS YOU ALL SIFT THROUGH IT, YOU TAKE A HARD LOOK AT WHAT PEOPLE ARE PROPOSING, YOU ASK OURSELVES, DOES THIS JUST SOUND GOOD ON PAPER OR CAN IT GET DONE AND WHO IS MOST LIKELY ABLE TO DELIVER WHAT YOU NEED FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY? I THINK THE KEY ISSUE HAS TO BE AND MUST BE THE ECONOMY. THAT IS SOMETHING WE DEMOCRATS AGREE ON. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE TO GET THE ECONOMY PRODUCING MORE GOOD PAYING JOBS AND RAISING INCOMES AGAIN FOR EVERYBODY WILLING TO WORK HARD, DO THEIR PART TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. I THINK IT IS FAIR TO POINT OUT THAT THE FACTS ARE ON OUR SIDE. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY PRODUCES PRESIDENTS WHO IMPROVE THE ECONOMY AND GIVE MORE AMERICANS A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO THEIR DREAMS.   THAT IS A CONVENIENT ARGUMENT, BUT IT HAS THE BENEFIT OF BEING TRUE. I'M NOT JUST STANDING HERE TELL YOU THIS BECAUSE I'M IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE KNOW THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER WITH A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE KNOW THE LAST TWO DEMOCRATS WERE EFFECTIVE, TURNING US AROUND AND PUTTING US ON THE RIGHT TRACK. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WILL DO. JUST A LITTLE BRIEF HISTORY. I DO THINK IT MATTERS WHAT WE HAVE A CONTEST IN THE PAST. THAT IS HOW YOU CAN JUDGE US. THAT IS HOW OUR PARTY CAN BE JUDGED. WHEN MY HUSBAND BECAME PRESIDENT, HE INHERITED A RECESSION. THE QUADRUPLING OF OUR NATIONAL DEBT AND DEFICIT. WHEN HE GOT TO WASHINGTON, HE SAID, WHAT YOU BRING TO WASHINGTON? HE SAID, I GUESS ARITHMETIC BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT AT UP FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. AFTER EIGHT YEARS, 23 MILLION NEW JOBS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, AND THIS IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO HEAR BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH AND MUST DO AGAIN. INCOMES WENT UP FOR EVERYONE. EVERYONE. NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES. WORKING PEOPLE. MOST IMPORTANTLY, BECAUSE OF MY LONG ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF KIDS, WE LIFTED MORE PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY IN THOSE EIGHT YEARS THAN IN ANY OTHER RECENT TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THAT MATTERS. AND WE ENDED UP WITH A BALANCED BUDGET AND SURPLUS. I THINK THAT IS NOT ONLY A GOOD RECORD FOR BILL CLINTON, THAT IS A GOOD RECORD FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND WHAT WE STAND FOR AND WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. NOW, I WISH THIS WERE A STORY THAT CONTINUED TO HAVE HAPPY CHAPTERS TO IT. BUT ALONG CAME THE REPUBLICANS AGAIN. WE MUST NEVER, EVER LET ANYBODY NEW HAMPSHIRE FORGET THAT TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS WAS A FAILURE THEN AND IT WOULD BE A FAILURE TOMORROW. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE REPUBLICANS, THAT IS THE SAME SNAKE OIL THEY ARE PEDDLING TODAY. IN CAME A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, AND DON'T EVER FORGET, CLOSE ELECTIONS MATTER. IT IS LITTLE DIFFERENT WHEN YOU GET SELECTED BY THE SUPREME COURT, BUT NONETHELESS, GEORGE W. BUSH BECAME PRESIDENT AND DISMANTLED EVERYTHING THAT HAD BEEN BUILT. GET OUT OF THE WAY OF CORPORATIONS. TAKE YOUR EYES OFF WALL STREET, THE MORTGAGE MARKETS, AND WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE WE LIVED THROUGH IT. IN CAME A NEW, YOUNG, DYNAMIC DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT. THERE WERE SO MUCH HE HAD FOUGHT FOR AND ADVOCATED FOR DURING THE CAMPAIGN. THE FIRST THING HE GETS MET WITH IS, WE ARE LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH THANKS TO THE FAILED POLICIES OF THE OTHER PARTY. I REMEMBER TALKING TO THE PRESIDENT-ELECT WHEN HE ASKED ME TO COME TO CHICAGO AFTER THE ELECTION. HE WANTED TO ASK ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE BUT HE SAID, IT IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN THEY TOLD US AND IT WAS. WE LOST 9 MILLION JOBS. PEOPLE WONDER, WHY ARE FOLKS IN AMERICA UPSET? WHY ARE WE ANGRY? 9 MILLION JOBS. MULTIPLY THAT BY FAMILY MEMBERS. THAT IS A LOT OF AMERICANS. 5 MILLION HOMES LOST. THE MOST IMPORTANT INVESTMENT YOU EVER MADE, RIPPED AWAY BECAUSE OF THE MORTGAGE FINAGLING THAT WENT ON. AND THEN, $13 TRILLION IN FAMILY WEALTH. PEOPLE BUILT IT UP. YOU WANT TO PASS IT ON. $13 TRILLION WIPED AWAY. THAT IS WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA INHERITED. I DON'T THINK HE GETS THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR DIGGING US OUT OF THE DEBT WE FOUND OURSELVES IN.   I KNOW THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY, WELL WE SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE. HE SHOULD HAVE FOUGHT HARDER. I WATCHED IT UP CLOSE. I WAS IN THAT. I WATCHED HIM. SAVE THE AUTO INDUSTRY AND THE MILLIONS OF JOBS THAT WENT WITH IT. I WATCHED HIM PUSHED THROUGH THE TOUGHEST REGULATIONS ON WALL STREET SINCE THE 1930'S. I WATCHED HIM ACHIEVE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND MADE SURE AMERICANS HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY, AFFORDABLE CARE. NOW, WHERE I COME FROM, THAT WAS A LOT OF GOOD WORK, MY FRIENDS. THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE ACCOMPLISHMENT. BUT WE HAVE MORE TO DO. LET'S NOT LET THE REPUBLICANS CAST A PALL OF COLLECTIVE AMNESIA OVER AMERICA. HONESTLY, I LISTEN TO THEM TALK ABOUT CUTTING TAXES ON THE WEALTHY, IN FACT ONE OF THEM SAID RECENTLY, THE PROBLEM IN 2008 WAS NOT TOO LITTLE REGULATION ON WALL STREET, IT WAS TOO MUCH REGULATION ON WALL STREET. I LISTEN TO THEM. I WATCH THEM VOTING TO REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. MAKE NO MISTAKE, WE ARE IN A FIGHT TO THE FINISH ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE GOING TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE OR WATCH IT GET RIPPED AWAY. NEW HAMPSHIRE IS GOING TO HAVE TO DECIDE WHO CAN GO TOE TO TOE WITH THE REPUBLICANS TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T WRECK US AGAIN. BUT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH EITHER. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO TELL YOU WHAT I AM AGAINST. THAT IS THE EASY PART OF POLITICS. WE ARE ALL AGAINST BAD STUFF, HOWEVER WE DEFINE IT. I WILL LET YOU KNOW WHAT I AM FOR. I WILL LET YOU KNOW WHAT I WILL DO. BILL IS RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY GENE OR WHATEVER IT IS. I WAKE UP EVERY DAY, TRYING TO THINK OUT, CAN I HELP ONE PERSON? MAYBE I CAN HELP 100. I AM BLESSED AND I AM GRATEFUL. I ALSO FEEL COMPELLED TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN EVERY SINGLE DAY TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE AND THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO DO AS YOUR PRESIDENT.   NUMBER ONE, JOB ONE. MORE JOBS WITH RISING INCOMES. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE A RAISE AND THEY HAVE NOT HAD ONE. I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS THE GOVERNMENT CAN AND SHOULD DO. WE NEED MORE INFRASTRUCTURE JOBS. WE CAN PUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO WORK. GOOD JOBS THAT CANNOT BE EXPORTED. WE CAN MAKE OUR ECONOMY MORE COMPETITIVE. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO COMING UP WITH SOME IDEAS THAT BOTH WORK WITH CONGRESS AND GO AROUND CONGRESS, LIKE A NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE BANK WHERE WE HAVE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DOLLARS TO MAKE US MORE COMPETITIVE. NOT JUST WITH PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, VIRTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE. IT IS TIME WE FINALLY GOT HIGH-SPEED, AFFORDABLE INTERNET COVERAGE IN EVERY SINGLE PART OF THIS COUNTRY. THAT IS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE. I WILL TELL YOU, I AM ONE OF THESE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE WE COULD HAVE A MANUFACTURING BASE IN AMERICA. I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE UP ON MAKING THINGS. THERE ARE TWO MINI GOOD JOBS AND TOO MANY OPPORTUNITIES. I HAVE BEEN TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES LIKE THIS ONE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO HELP PREPARE PEOPLE WHO ARE YOUNG OR MAYBE NOT SO YOUNG FOR THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE. I WANT TO BE A GOOD PARTNER FOR YOU. I WANT TO CHANGE THE TAX CODE, WHICH STILL GIVES INCENTIVES TO BUSINESSES TO MOVE JOBS OVERSEAS. TOLD FACTORIES OVERSEAS INSTEAD OF UPGRADING OUR MANUFACTURING. BRING NEW ADVANCED MANUFACTURING RIGHT HERE TO NEW HAMPSHIRE. I VISITED SO MANY PLACES IN THE STATE. HERE IN NASHUA, I WENT TO A VENERABLE MANUFACTURING COMPANY. IT HAS BEEN AROUND MORE THAN 100 YEARS. IN ADDITION TO MACHINERY THEY HAD LITERALLY 100 YEARS AGO, THEY HAVE SOME OF THE MOST ADVANCED COMPUTERIZED MACHINERY BECAUSE THEY ARE KEEPING UP WITH THE TIMES. THEY GOT SOME HELP DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. THE DOZENS OF PEOPLE WORKING THERE AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE SO GRATEFUL THEY DID. WE NEED GOOD WORK THAT GIVES PEOPLE THE DIGNITY, NOT JUST THE INCOME, AS IMPORTANT AS THAT IS. THE DIGNITY OF FEELING THEY ARE CONTRIBUTING TO OUR SOCIETY. I WANT MORE PEOPLE TO BELIEVE, ONCE AGAIN, THEY ARE VALUED BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY CAN DO FOR THEMSELVES AND OTHERS. THE BEST WAY TO GET NEW JOBS IS TO FINALLY COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE BY REALLY GOING AFTER CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY.   I AM ALWAYS JUST A LITTLE AMUSED WHEN THE REPUBLICANS ARE ASKED, AS THEY ARE, WHAT THEY THINK OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THEN THEY SAY, I DON'T KNOW, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST. YOU HAVE HEARD THAT, RIGHT? I HAVE GONE ACROSS THE COUNTRY TRYING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR THEM. I HAVE SAID, YOU KNOW YOU CAN REMEDY THIS BY TALKING TO A SCIENTIST. YOU CAN GO TO THE UNIVERSITIES. YOU CAN COME TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. YOU CAN GO TO HIGH SCHOOLS AND TALK TO SCIENCE TEACHERS AND THEY WILL EXPLAIN SCIENCE TO YOU AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING.   I HAVE CONCLUDED THAT NOT ALL OF THEM ARE THAT IGNORANT. I HAVE CONCLUDED THEY ARE DOING WITH THE KOCH BROTHERS TELL THEM TO. THAT IS BAD ENOUGH, TO BE IN THAT KIND OF DENIAL. THEY ARE MISSING A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO GROW OUR ECONOMY. SOME NATION IS GOING TO BE 21ST CENTURY SUPERPOWER. I FIGURED IS GOING TO BE CHINA, GERMANY, OR US AND I WANTED TO BE US AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN AS YOUR PRESIDENT TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. I HAVE SET SOME BIG GOALS. I SAID, WE ARE GOING TO DEPLOY HALF A BILLION SOLAR PANELS BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM. AND I WAS VERY PROUD TO BE ENDORSED BY THE LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO AND WHAT WE MUST DO. I AM MOST EXCITED BY SEEING US BEGIN TO SET THE GOALS IN AMERICA. HAVE POSITIVE ENERGY AROUND WHAT WE CAN DO WITH ENERGY. LET YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL THEY HAVE A FUTURE TO HELP PAVE THE WAY. THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO SEE. MORE STEM IN SCHOOLS. MORE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WORKING AS ENGINEERS. MORE PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING THIS IS THE CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME AND IF WE PUT OUR MINDS TO THIS, WE CAN DO IT. WE CAN OVERCOME THE DENIAL AND SPECIAL INTERESTS AND THE OIL LOBBY. WE CAN DO THIS BUT WE NEED LEADERSHIP THAT UNDERSTANDS IT AND MAKES IT A PRIORITY AND ACTUALLY CALL PUSHES IT. -- ACCOMPLISHES IT. AND LET ME SAY, AS I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES, FOR THOSE OF YOU NOT FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE, THAT IS THE NAME OF A BEER COMPANY. IT IS PRETTY GOOD, TOO. I WANT TO BE THE SMALL BUSINESS PRESIDENT. THAT IS WHERE THE JOBS COME FROM AND WE NEED TO DO MORE TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES. GIVE THEM THE CREDIT THEY NEED TO GET STARTED. THE TWO FASTEST WAYS TO RAISE INCOME ARE TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE, WHICH IS TOO LOW. AND FINALLY, GUARANTEED EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN'S WORK.   I AM SO ADAMANT ABOUT THIS AND I AM THRILLED WE HAVE SOME THE GREAT WOMEN LEADERS OF OUR TIME HERE WITH US TODAY. WE HAVE STEPHANIE FROM EMILY'S LIST. A GREAT GROUP OF WOMEN LEADERS WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR WOMEN IN THIS ELECTION.   I FEEL IT IS A LITTLE BIT AWKWARD TO BE STATING THE OBVIOUS ALL THE TIME. YOU DO THE WORK, YOU SHOULD GET THE PAY. LILLY LEDBETTER JUST ENDORSED ME, THE WOMAN WHO FOUGHT FOR EQUAL PAY, SHE WORKED HER WAY UP IN A FACTORY IN ALABAMA. SHE WORKED JUST AS HARD, AND GOT JUST AS GOOD A VALUATIONS AND THEN ONE DAY BY ACCIDENT, SHE DISCOVERED SHE HAD NEVER BEEN PAID THE SAME AS HER FELLOW MALE SUPERVISORS. THIS IS NOT SOME URBAN LEGEND, MY FRIENDS. THIS IS HAPPENING EVERY DAY ACROSS THE STATE AND AMERICA. IT IS BAD FOR WOMEN BECAUSE IT IS UNFAIR, AND THE MENTALLY. IT IS BAD FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AND IT IS BAD FOR THE ECONOMY. WE ARE A CONSUMPTION ECONOMY. WE NEED MORE MONEY TO MAKE SURE WE ARE BUILDING A BETTER FUTURE WITH GOOD RESULTS ECONOMICALLY. SO EVERYTHING I JUST TOLD YOU, THE REPUBLICANS DO NOT AGREE WITH. THEY DON'T AGREE WITH INFRASTRUCTURE, MANUFACTURING. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE OR EQUAL PAY. IT IS A BIG DIFFERENCE. THESE ARE THINGS I HAVE WORKED ON, CARED ABOUT FOUR YEARS. I KNOW HOW ESSENTIAL THEY ARE TO MAKING SURE EVERY AMERICAN HAS A FAIR SHOT IN THE RACE OF LIFE. A FAIR CHANCE TO GET THAT PROMISE OF AMERICA MADE REAL. ONE OF THE OTHER BIG ISSUES WE HAVE TO THINK HARD ABOUT THIS WEEK IS HEALTH CARE. HERE IS WHERE I STAND. BEFORE WAS CALLED OBAMACARE, IT WAS CALLED HILLARY CARE.   I TRIED TO GET QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. INSURANCE COMPANIES AND A DRUG COMPANIES, THEY BEAT US. THAT WAS DISAPPOINTING. I KNEW SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE DESPERATE TO HAVE HEALTH CARE WHO DID NOT HAVE IT. I MET A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, BACK IN 1992. BILL AND I MET PEOPLE WHO WERE JUST DESPERATE. THEY HAD PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, COULD NOT GET INSURANCE. PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS THEY COULD NOT AFFORD. THEY WOULD GET LAID OFF. THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR INSURANCE. THEY WERE YOUNG, STARTING OFF. THEY COULD NOT AFFORD IT, COULD NOT GET IT. STORIES HAVE STUCK WITH ME SO POWERFULLY. AFTER WE WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL, I SAID, WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ESPECIALLY FOR ALL THE FAMILIES WITH SICK KIDS I MET HERE. I GOT TO WORK. WORKED WITH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO GET THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM WHICH ENSURES 8 MILLION KIDS. I MEET THESE FAMILIES HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I MEET THEM BECAUSE THEY, AND THEY THANKED ME. THIS IS WHAT A COUNTRY IS SUPPOSED TO DO FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED HELP. DON'T THANK ME. YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS SO THRILLED PRESIDENT OBAMA PASSED AND SIGNED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE HAD DEMOCRATS, WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING TO THE PATH OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE SINCE HARRY TRUMAN. WE FINALLY HAVE THE BASE THAT WILL ENABLE US TO GET THERE. BUT THERE ARE VERY DIFFERENT RESPONSES. ON THE ONE HAND, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE VOTED TO REPEAL IT 62 TIMES PER THEY SENT A REPEAL TO THE PRESIDENT'S DESK EVERYTHING GOODNESS HE WAS THERE AND BE DOTED. A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN CONGRESS WILL REPEAL THE ACT AS FAST AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I WANT YOU TO KNOW I AM NOT SATISFIED. I'M NOT SATISFIED WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT. WE HAVE TO IMPROVE IT. WE HAVE TO GET OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS DOWN. CO-PAYS, DEDUCTIBLES, WE CAN'T LET THOSE INTERFERE WITH PEOPLE EXERCISING THEIR RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE. WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T TAKE IT OVER AGAIN AND SAY YOU ARE OUT OF LUCK WITH A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. WE HAVE TO KEEP YOUNG PEOPLE ON THEIR PARENTS' POLICIES UNTIL THEY ARE 26 WHICH HAS BEEN SUCH A LIFESAVER FOR THEM. SO I BRING OUT AN AGENDA ABOUT HOW WE GO FROM WHERE WE ARE NOW, 90% COVERAGE, THE HIGHEST WE HAVE EVER HAD. 90% COVERAGE. SENATOR SANDERS SHARES MY GOAL OF 100% COVERAGE BUT HE HAS A DIFFERENT APPROACH. HE WANTS US TO START OVER. HE WANTS US TO BEGIN ANOTHER CONTENTIOUS NATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH HEALTH CARE. I FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE. I DON'T WANT US TO GO BACK TO GRIDLOCK. I WANT TO CURE DISEASES. PEOPLE CAN'T WAIT FOR ANOTHER DEBATE. BESIDES, I THINK IT IS A LOT EASIER TO GET FROM 90% TO 100% THAN FROM ZERO TO 100%. I WILL CONTINUE TO DEFEND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND TELL YOU WHAT WE NEED TO DO DIFFERENTLY. ONE AREA IN PARTICULAR, GETTING PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS DOWN. WHAT WE ARE FACING TODAY, WE ARE FACING SKYROCKETING DRUG COSTS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS. ONE IS BECAUSE OF A GIMMICK, THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BIG BANKS. SPECULATORS AND GREED. THE PURCHASE OF SMALL DRUG COMPANIES, TAKEN OVER BY SPECULATORS WHO THEN GET CONTROL OF A DRUG THAT GIVES PEOPLE -- KEEPS PEOPLE ALIVE AND INCREASES THE PRICE AS HIGH AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN. I HAVE MET PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA WHO HAVE TOLD ME THIS. I WILL GIVE YOU A QUICK STORY FROM IOWA. I WAS IN CLINTON, IOWA. A WOMAN CAME TO SEE ME. SHE SAID, I HAVE TO ASK YOU, WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THIS? SHE SAID, I HAVE BEEN TAKING THE SAME DRUG SINCE 1988. IT STARTED OFF AT $20 A SHOT. I WAS ABLE TO HANDLE THAT. WENT ON FOR YEARS. LAST MONTH, I GO TO THE PHARMACIST TO FILL MY PRESCRIPTION. THE PHARMACIST SAID, IT IS GOING TO COST YOU $14,000. I SAID, WHAT? SHOW ME THE PAPER. SHE HANDS ME THIS PAPER. I SAID, OK, I GET IT. THE DRUG COMPANY THAT WAS MAKING THAT DRUG FOR YEARS, THERE WAS NO RESEARCH MONEY GOING INTO IT, NO NEW DISCOVERIES, THIS WAS A TRIED AND TRUE DRUG THAT HAD BEEN ON THE SHELF HELPING PEOPLE. IT HAD BEEN BOUGHT BY A COMPANY AND THEY PROCEEDED TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANTED WITH THE PRICE. NOW, I THINK WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS PREDATORY PRICING. I WILL HAVE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND EVERY TOOL AT MY DISPOSAL TO GO AFTER THESE COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING THIS TO PEOPLE WHO NEED THE HELP. WE'VE GOT TO BE SMART ABOUT HOW WE PREVENT THESE ABUSES, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO BE SMART ABOUT HOW WE GET LOWER PRICES. THAT IS WHY WE MUST FINALLY GIVE MEDICARE IN THE RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE FOR LOWER DRUG PRICES WITH THE COMPANIES. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I KNOW SOME PEOPLE THINK THESE ARE JUST DETAILS. I SHOULD JUST FLY AT 30,000 FEET AND SAY, WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS AND THAT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT IS NOT HOW I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD SELECT A PRESIDENT. I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO FOR YOU BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACTUALLY DELIVERING FOR YOU. I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE. I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF GOOD WORK WE CAN DO IN EDUCATION AND I AM PROUD TO HAVE TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS. THANK YOU ANY A. -- NEA. I DO BELIEVE THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE TEACHERS ARE SO CRITICAL TO CHILDREN'S LEARNING. I THINK IT'S TIME WE STARTED SUPPORTING TEACHERS, NOT SCAPEGOATING TEACHERS IN AMERICA.   THERE ARE THINGS WE NEED TO DO THAT WILL ACTUALLY HELP MORE KIDS SUCCEED. STARTING WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND UNIVERSAL PREKINDERGARTEN. THIS IS A CAUSE FOR ME. I KNOW WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT MAKES. NOW WE HAVE ALL THIS RAIN RESEARCH WHICH MAKES IT SO CLEAR, 80% OF YOUR BRAIN IS PHYSICALLY FORMED BY THE AGE OF THREE. WE HAVE TO DO MORE. I FOUND A PROGRAM IN ISRAEL AND I BROUGHT IT TO ARKANSAS. I WANT TO DO WHATEVER I CAN BECAUSE WE HAVE TOO MANY LITTLE KIDS GOING INTO SCHOOL NOT PREPARED TO LEARN, NOT ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT THEIR TEACHERS HAVE TO OFFER AND NEED SO MUCH HELP. WE HAVE TO MAKE SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T DONE, THAT IS WITHOUT I PROGRAM. OR DEBT FREE TUITION, AND ANY PUBLIC OR COLLEGE UNIVERSITY. I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN TO MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE SO WE GET MORE YOUNG PEOPLE GOING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE.  WE WILL TAKE ON THE STUDENT DEBT PROBLEM. WE ARE GOING TO HELP YOU REFINANCE YOUR DEBT AND PAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND BE HAPPY MOVE INTO REPAYING IT BASED ON YOUR INCOME, NOT A FIXED INTEREST RATE. THAT IS WHAT IS SUPPRESSING THE EARNINGS AND OPPORTUNITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE.   THERE IS A LOT TO DO HERE AT HOME, LET'S NOT FORGET WE HAVE A LOT TO DO IN THE WORLD. THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED WORLD. I KNOW THAT, I WAS PRIVILEGED TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE FIRST TIME A PRESIDENT OBAMA.   I SPENT A LOT OF HOURS IN THE SITUATION ROOM WORKING OVER PROBLEMS THAT DON'T GET TO THAT ROOM UNLESS THEY ARE HARD. IF IT ISN'T HARD, SOMEBODY ELSE HANDLES IT ON THE WAY UP. ONCE IT GETS THERE, AND ARE SITTING THERE WITH THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, THE CIA DIRECTOR, THE PRESIDENT, THE VICE PRESIDENT, THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, YOU KNOW YOU'RE FACING SOME HARD CHOICES. YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT, P OOLING YOUR EXPERIENCE, WHAT WILL KEEP AMERICA SAFE. WHAT WILL HELP OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES AND PARTNERS ARE ON THE WORLD. I AM ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO DEAL WITH THE MAIN CHALLENGES WE FACE, BUT ALSO TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS WORLD. I HAVE LAID OUT A COMPANY HEADS OF APPROACH FOR DEALING WITH ISIS AND DEFEATING IT. I TAKE THE THREAT OF TERRORISM SERIOUSLY. I WAS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK ON 9/11, YOU KNOW WHAT WE WENT THROUGH. I WILL SPARE NO EFFORTS TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE, TO BE OUR COUNTRY SAFE AND PROTECT AMERICAN FAMILIES. I WANT TO DO IT IN A SMART WAY THAT PRODUCES THE KIND OF WORLD THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR. YES, I WANT TO GO AFTER THEM OVER THERE. I WANT TO HAVE AN INTENSIVE AMERICAN-LED COALITION TO GO AFTER THEIR LEADERSHIP AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THE ARAB AND KURDISH FORCES ON THE GROUND. I WILL NOT SEND AMERICAN COMBAT TROOPS BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IS PART OF A SMART STRATEGY.   I WILL CERTAINLY WORK TO CUT OFF THE FLOW OF FOREIGN FUNDS AND FOREIGN FIGHTERS. WE NEED A LOT OF SMART YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES TO HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW TO GET UNDERNEATH THEIR PROPAGANDA AND THEIR CELEBRATION OF VIOLENCE. THEIR RADICALIZATION OF PEOPLE IN EUROPE, THE UNITED STATES, AND ELSEWHERE. I WANT TO KEEP A SAVIOR. AFTER 9/11, WE HAD A PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAM IN NEW YORK CALLED IF THE SEASONING SUSPICIOUS, REPORTED. WE HAD A UNIFIED FRONT. WE REACHED OUT TO EVERY COMMUNITY. LEADERSHIP DEAD, AND SAID CALL THE POLICE -- LEADERSHIP DID, AND SAID CALL THE POLICE. WE SAW THAT THE ATTACKS WERE FOILED AND PREVENTED DESPITE CONSTANT INTELLIGENCE ABOUT POTENTIAL NEW ATTACKS. IT HAS BEEN SAFE. I MENTION THIS BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE CANDIDATE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE WHO INSULT AMERICAN MUSLIMS, WHO INSULT MUSLIM NATIONS, AND THE RELIGION OF ISLAMIC, THAT IS NOT ONLY OFFENSIVE AND SHAMEFUL, THAT IS DANGEROUS. THAT IS PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF THE TERRORISTS. IT ISOLATES AND MARGINALIZES PEOPLE THAT WE WANT TO BE PART OF OUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE. THAT IS WHY I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OUT AGAINST IT ANYWHERE THAT I GO. I WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. IT ALSO AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO PUT TOGETHER A COALITION. THAT INCLUDES MUSLIM NATIONS TO GO AFTER TERRORISTS. I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO PUT TOGETHER A COALITION, I DID IT ON THE ONE THAT PUT SANCTIONS ON IRAN AND DROVE THEM TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE THAT LED TO THE AGREEMENT TO PUT A LID ON THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM. AND YOU DON'T GO TO NATIONS AND ASK THEM TO BE PART OF YOUR COALITION AFTER YOU INSULTED THEIR RELIGION. THAT IS NOT THE WAY IT WORKS IN THE REAL WORLD. WE HAVE TO BE FOCUSED ON THOSE THREATS THAT EXIST AND TO GO AFTER THEM IN A WAY THAT BRINGS OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER AND BRINGS THE WORLD TOGETHER. THIS IS NOT A CLASH BETWEEN CIVILIZATIONS, THIS IS A CLASH BETWEEN PROSPERITY AND CIVILIZATION. THAT IS HOW WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT.   FINALLY, LET ME JUST SAY THIS -- I SPENT A LOT OF MY LIFE FIGHTING TO EXPAND THE CIRCLE OF OPPORTUNITY, AND THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE. WHEN I LISTEN TO THE REPUBLICANS, IT CHILLS ME. THEY ARE AGAINST SO MANY OF THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE MADE IN LIFTING OF THE DIGNITY OF EVERY PERSON. I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHERE I STAND. I WILL FIGHT FOR A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN DECISION. I WILL FIGHT AGAINST DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD.  HERE, AND EVERYWHERE. I WILL DEFEND MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND FIGHT ON DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY.  I WILL FIGHT FOR VOTING RIGHTS AND TO OVERTURNED CITIZENS UNITED. I WILL FIGHT FOR COPPERHEADS AND IMMIGRATION REFORM AND A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP. I WILL FIGHT TO MAKE SURE WE GET CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND RNRN MATT -- END MASS INCARCERATION. I WILL DEFEND THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION, BUT I WILL NOT LET THE REPUBLICANS PRIVATIZE IT AND TAKE AWAY THE BENEFITS AND SERVICES THAT OUR VETERANS HAVE EARNED. I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY MEASURES AGAINST THE GUN LOBBY.   MY FRIENDS, THIS IS WHAT I STAND, THIS IS WHERE I WILL FIGHT. BUT I CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU. THIS WILL BE A GREAT WEEK OF CAMPAIGNING. TOMORROW NIGHT WE HAVE A FORUM ON CNN, THE NEXT NIGHT LIVE A DEBATE. I AM LOOKING SO FORWARD TO ENGAGING IN THE CONTEST OF IDEAS. ON OUR SIDE, WE DISAGREE ABOUT IDEAS. WE DISAGREE ABOUT HOW TO TRANSLATE THEM INTO POSITIVE RESULTS FOR PEOPLE. ON THEIR SIDE, IT IS INSULTS. IT IS NOT THE KIND OF DEBATE THAT YOU WANT TO HEAR WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO PICK WHO SHOULD BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF. NEW HAMPSHIRE, COME WITH ME THIS WEEK. MAKE THIS JOURNEY WITH ME, STAND UP FOR ME, FIGHT FOR ME. WHEN WE WIN, I WILL STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR YOU EVERY SINGLE DAY. THANK YOU, AND GOD BLESS YOU.

THANK YOU! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH! WOW. WHAT A NIGHT. AN UNBELIEVABLE NIGHT. WHAT A GREAT CAMPAIGN. THIS HAS BEEN --   THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE HONOR, TO CAMPAIGN ACROSS IOWA WITH SO MANY OF YOU, TO MAKE THE CASE OF THE KIND OF FUTURE WE WANT, FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, AND FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.   THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU WHO CAME OUT FOR ME, WHO WORKED SO MANY HOURS FROM MY YOUNG ORGANIZERS WITH ENERGY AND PASSION --   -- TO THE FAMILIES AND FRIENDS ACROSS THE STATE. I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL. WELL, I --   BUT HERE IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW. IT IS RARE THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY WE DO NOW. TO HAVE A REAL CONTEST OF IDEAS. TO REALLY THINK HARD ABOUT WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY STANDS FOR AND WHAT WE WANT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY TO LOOK LIKE, IF WE DO OUR PART TO BUILD IT. I AM A PROGRESSIVE WHO GETS THINGS DONE FOR PEOPLE.   I AM HONORED TO STAND IN THE LONG LINE OF AMERICAN REFORMERS, WHO MAKE UP OUR MINDS THAT THE STATUS QUO IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH, THAT STANDING STILL IS NOT AN OPTION, THAT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER TO FIND A WAY FORWARD THAT WILL IMPROVE THE LIVES OF AMERICANS. I LOOK BACK OVER THE YEARS OF MY INVOLVEMENT FROM THAT VERY FIRST JOB I HAD AT THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND --   -- AND I KNOW WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF DOING. I KNOW WE CAN CREATE MORE GOOD PAYING JOBS AND RAISE INCOMES FOR HARD-WORKING AMERICANS AGAIN. I KNOW THAT WE CAN FINISH THE JOB OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD.   I KNOW WE CAN COME BAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND BE THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF THE 21ST CENTURY.   I KNOW THAT WE CAN MAKE OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM WORK FOR EVERYONE OF OUR CHILDREN, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO COME WITH DISADVANTAGES.   I KNOW WE CAN MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AND GET STUDENT DEBT OFF THE BACKS OF YOUNG PEOPLE.   AND I KNOW WE CAN PROTECT OUR RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHTS, GAY RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS, IMMIGRANT RIGHTS, WORKERS RIGHTS.   I KNOW TOO WE CAN STAND UP TO THE GUN LOBBY AND GOOD COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY MEASURES.   AND HOW DO WE DO THAT? WE DO THAT BY SECURING THE NOMINATION, AND THEN WE DO IT BY WINNING AND GOING INTO THAT WHITE HOUSE, AS OTHERS BEFORE HAVE, DETERMINED TO PUSH FORWARD ON THE GREAT VALUES THAT UNITE US AS AMERICANS. I CONGRATULATE MY ESTEEMED FRIENDS AND OPPONENTS. I WISH GOVERNOR O'MALLEY THE VERY BEST. HE IS A GREAT PUBLIC SERVANT WHO HAS SERVED MARYLAND AND OUR COUNTRY.   AND I AM EXCITED ABOUT REALLY GETTING INTO THE DEBATE WITH SENATOR SANDERS ABOUT THE BEST WAY FORWARD TO FIGHT FOR US AND AMERICA.   IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, WE FINALLY BEGAN TO HAVE WHAT I THINK WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT, SUBSTANTIVE CONVERSATION THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY COULD HAVE. AND I AM THRILLED AT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PLAYING A PART IN THAT. I KNOW THAT WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION, ABOUT HOW BEST TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS. THAT I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A VERY CLEAR IDEA THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THIS CAMPAIGN STANDS FOR WHAT IS BEST IN AMERICA.   WHEN IT IS ALL SAID AND DONE, WE HAVE TO BE UNITED AGAINST A REPUBLICAN VISION AND CANDIDATES WHO WOULD DRIVE US APART AND DIVIDE US. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE, MY FRIENDS. I FOLLOWE THEIR CAMPAIGN VERY CLOSELY. I UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE APPEALING TO, AND I INTEND TO STAND AGAINST IT.   I WILL NOT LET THEIR DIVISIVENESS, THEIR EFFORTS TO RIP AWAY THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE, BE SUCCESSFUL, BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT. SO AS I STAND HERE TONIGHT, BREATHING A BIG SIGH OF RELIEF, THANK YOU, IOWA --   -- I WANT YOU TO KNOW I WILL KEEP DOING WHAT I HAVE DONE MY ENTIRE LIFE. I WILL KEEP STANDING UP FOR YOU. I WILL KEEP FIGHTING FOR YOU. I WILL ALWAYS WORK TO ACHIEVE THE AMERICA THAT I BELIEVE IN, WHERE THE PROMISE OF THAT DREAM THAT WE HOLD OUT TO OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN NEVER FADES, BUT INSPIRES GENERATIONS TO COME. JOIN THE. ME. LET'S GO WITH THE NOMINATION. THANK YOU ALL AND GOD BLESS YOU.   ",Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton Caucus Night Speech

THANK YOU SO MUCH CEDAR RAPIDS. THANK YOU SO MUCH, CHELSEA. THANK YOU.   WELL.   THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE AGAIN IN CEDAR RAPIDS. I'M THRILLED THAT CHELSEA AND BILL CAN BE WITH ME. THIS IS THE LAST WEEKEND BEFORE WE MOVE TOWARD THE CAUCUSES ON MONDAY NIGHT. I AM ESPECIALLY HONORED TO HAVE SO MANY ELECTED OFFICIALS HERE. I WANT TO THANK THEM ALL. THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING SO HARD. THEY WORKED SO HARD FOR ALL OF YOU. I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE. JUSTIN SHILTS, LIZ BENNETT, ROB POGUE, TAMMY, WHILE HE FORMED-- WALLY HORNE, LET'S GIVE ALL THOSE GREAT PEOPLE FROM HEARING AROUND THE COUNTRY A THANK YOU FROM ALL OF US.   I AM REALLY HAPPY TO SEE SOME MANY OF YOU WHO ARE WORKING SO HARD TO GET READY FOR THE CAUCUSES. I WANT TO THANK THE PRECINCT TEAMS. LET'S SAY THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU. TO ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE MADE UP YOUR MIND AKAKA'S FROM THE ON MONDAY NIGHT, THANK YOU SO MUCH -- YOUR MIND TO CAUCUS FOR ME ON MONDAY NIGHT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US IN MAKING PROGRESS IN OUR COUNTRY.   YOU KNOW, THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. I KNOW THAT IT STARTS ON MONDAY. YOU WILL BE THE FIRST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TO GET TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ABOUT WHO YOU THINK SHOULD BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.   AS YOU ALL MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO GO AND CAUCUS, AND I HOPE YOU WILL SIGN UP, YOU HAVE GOTTEN FOLKS COMING IN FROM THE BACK, MAYBE THEY CAN JUST KIND OF COME UP. I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN SOME OVERFLOWING COULD COME UP IN FRONT OF THE -- OVERFLOWING. COME UP IN FRONT OF THE PRESS RISER SO YOU CAN SEE. LET ME SAY THIS. THE REASON IT IS SO IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T. YOU HAVE HAD REPUBLICANS CRISSCROSSED THE STATE, HAVEN'T YOU? YOU HAVE HEARD WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING, WTHEY WANT TO TURN BACK THE CLOCK TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW THAT WE CAN FIGHT AGAINST THEM. I WILL TAKE THAT FIGHT AND GO ALL THE WAY TO NOVEMBER. -- ALL THE WAY TO NONOVEMBER. THEN, THE WHITE HOUSE.   WE DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK THAT FAR TO REALIZE IT. THINK ABOUT THE LAST TWO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS? ONE OF THEM IS HERE TONIGHT.   EACH OF THEM INHERITED ECONOMIC PROBLEMS FROM THE REPUBLICAN PREDECESSOR, DID THN'T THEY? WHEN BILL GOT TO WASHINGTON, THEY ASKED HIM WHAT HE BROUGHT UNIQUELY TO BEGIN SOLVING OUR PROBLEMS. HE SAID, I GUESS ARITHMETIC. HE SAID WE WILL ADD UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA. AT THE END OF EIGHT YEARS, THERE WERE 23 MILLION NEW JOBS. MOST IMPORTANT, INCOME WENT UP. DON'T TELL ME WE CANNOT RAISE INCOME FOR EVERYBODY. WE DID IT. MIDDLE-CLASS FOLKS, WORKING PEOPLE, POOR PEOPLE. THEY WERE ALL BETTER OFF. WE ENDED UP WITH A BALANCED BUDGET IN THE SURPLUS. THEN WHAT HAPPENED? ANOTHER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT. WE WENT BACKWARDS, I WAS SPEAKING IN THE SENATE AGAINST THOSE POLICIES TO CUT TAXES ON THE WEALTHY. TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF CORPORATIONS AND TAKE YOUR EYES OFF OF THE FINANCIAL AND MORTGAGE MARKETS. LOOK AT WHAT WE GOT LEFT WITH? A NEW, YOUNG, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT. PRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA.   HE CALLED ME RIGHT AFTER THAT ELECTION ASKING ME TO COME SEE HIM IN CHICAGO TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE. BEFORE WE GOT TO THAT, HE SAID IT IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN THEY TOLD US. WE WERE LOSING 800,000 JOBS PER MONTH. 9 MILLION AMERICANS LOST JOBS. 5 MILLION HOMES WERE LOST. $13 TRILLION IN FAMILY WEALTH WAS WIPED OUT. PRESIDENT OBAMA DOES NOT GET THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR MAKING SURE WE CAN FOLLOW TO THE GREAT DEPRESSION.   SO, WE ARE STANDING, BUT WE ARE NOT YET RUNNING. PEOPLE HAVE NOT HAD THEIR INCOMES GO UP. THERE IS STILL TOO MUCH INEQUALITY. TOO MUCH UNFAIRNESS. WE NEED A PLAN AND A COMMITMENT AND ME. YES, THANK YOU.   I WILL CALL YOU WHAT I WILL DO-- TELL YOU WHAT I WILL DO. WE WILL CREATE MORE JOBS. LET'S HAVE MORE INFRASTRUCTURE, THE ROADS, BRIDGES, TUNNELS. WE HAVE WORKED IN DOING THIS COUNTRY. -- WORK TO DO IN THIS COUNTRY. WE NEED TO MAKE INVESTMENTS THAT WILL MAKE US MORE COMPETITIVE AS AN ECONOMY. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO STRIP AWAY THE INCENTIVES IN THE TAX CODE. THIS ALLOWS PEOPLE TO TAKE JOBS, MOVE THEM OVERSEAS, SO LET'S BRING THEM BACK HERE AND PUT PEOPLE TO WORK IN AMERICA.   I BELIEVE WE CAN MAKE THINGS IN AMERICA. I BELIEVE IT BECAUSE I HAVE VISITED YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I WAS UP AT BLACKHAWK. THEY HAVE PARTNERSHIP WITH UNI. THEY BOUGHT THE BIGGEST 3-D PRINTER IN NORTH AMERICA. THEIR TRAINING PEOPLE TO USE IT SO THAT THEY CAN ATTRACT JOBS TO IOWA. THEY CAN BE A HUB OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN MANUFACTURING. A MANUFACTURING RENAISSANCE. WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HELPS THAT, DOESN'T STAND IN THE SIDELINES, THAT WE RECRUIT AND KEEP AND GROW JOBS. WE WILL COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND CREATE MORE CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY JOBS.   YOU ALL HEAR THE REPUBLICANS WHEN THEY ARE ASKED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. THEY SAY, ""I DON'T KNOW, I AM NOT A SCIENTIST."" I WISH THEY WOULD HEAR ME, BECAUSE THE ANSWER IS EASY, TALK TO A SCIENTIST. GO THE UNIVERSITIES, COME TO THE HIGH SCHOOL. YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS GOOD.   WHAT I REALLY BELIEVE IS THAT MOST OF THEM ARE NOT THAT ILL INFORMED. THEY JUST DO IT THE KOCH BROTHERS TELL THEM. THAT'S BAD ENOUGH. IT IS REALLY UNFORTUNATE THAT THEY HAVE MISSED OUT ON ONE OF THE BIGGEST ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THIS COUNTRY. SOME COUNTRY WILL BE THE 21ST CENTURY SUPERPOWER. I THINK IT WILL BE CHINA, GERMANY, OR US. THERE IS NO REASON IT CAN'T BE US.   THIS IS LIKE THOSE BIG GOALS THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO SET AND PUT EVERYBODY TO WORK TO ACHIEVE. I KNOW WE CAN. WHEN I TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY AND TELL PEOPLE WE CAN BE THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER AND SEE SKEPTICISM, WE KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IN IOWA? THEY ARE TO GET ONE THIRD OF THEIR ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES, MOSTLY WIND.   WE HAVE LET IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOFUELS AND ARE NOW WORKING ON ADVANCED BIOFUELS TO SEE WHETHER THEY CAN POWER NAVAL VESSELS AND AIR FORCE AIRPLANES. THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU ALL TO KNOW. YOU ARE IN THE LEAD WHEN IT COMES TO NEW OPENING -- TWO RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY. LET'S TAKE ALL THE GOOD THINGS HAPPENING ACROSS AMERICA AND LIFT THEM UP. LET'S CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS. LET'S DEPLOY HALF A BILLION MORE SOLAR PANELS BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM AND ENOUGH CLEAN ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME BY THE END OF MY SECOND. WE CAN DO THIS.   I ALSO WANT TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS COULD THAT IS -- SMALL BUSINESS. THAT'S WHERE MTHE JOBS COME FROM. THE TWO FASTEST WAYS TO RAISE INCOME ARE RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE, THE WORK FULL-TIME SHOULD NOT BE IN POVERTY, AND LET'S FINALLY GET EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN'S WORK.   EVERYTHING I HAVE JUST TOLD YOU, THE REPUBLICANS DO NOT AGREE WITH. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT MANUFACTURING. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT CLEAN ENERGY, THE WAY WE SHOULD. THEY WILL NOT RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. DON'T THINK HE IS A PROBLEM. -- THEY DON'T THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM. WE ARE SEEING THEM IN AN ALTERNATE REALITY. WE NEED TO MAKE THE TAX CODE FAIR. THAT MEANS WE ARE GOING WHERE THE MONEY IS, THE MONEY IS WHERE THE WEALTHY ARE. WE WILL CHANGE THE TAX CODE AND MAKE THEM PAY FOR ALL OF THE BENEFITS THEY HAVE HERE IN AMERICA.   THERE'S A BUNCH OF THINGS I WANT TO DO TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES. I AM THE ONLY CANDIDATE ON EITHER SIDE WHO HAS SAID PLAINLY IDLE RAISE YOUR INCOMES-- PLAIN LY I WILL RAISE YOUR INCOMES, NOT YOUR MIDDLE-CLASS TAXES. I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED FUNDING TO HELP MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE. TO HELP WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. TO DO THE THINGS THAT WILL LIFT US UP. I WENT TO OMAHA A FEW WEEKS AGO. WARREN BUFFETT ENDORSED ME, AND I WAS VERY HAPPY TO HAVE THAT SUPPORT.   HE SAID HE AGREED WITH ME THAT TAXES HAD TO GO UP ON RICH PEOPLE, LIKE HIM. HE SAID THAT WILL MAKE INTO POPULAR, BUT I BELIEVE HE IS RIGHT. I SUPPORT ""THE BUFFETT RULLE."" I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE THAT MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS SHOULD PAY 30%. RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE OF ALL THE LOOPHOLES, THEY PAY LESS TAXES THAN THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE TEACHERS. I WANT A FAIR SHARE ON INCOMES OF $5 MILLION OR MORE. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO PULL EVERY SHENANIGAN IN THE BOOK. THEY SEND MONEY TO THE BERMUDAS, BAHAMAS, MONEY FLYING AROUND SO THAT IT CANNOT BE TAXED THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO. WE HAVE TO AND THAT.-- TO END THAT. WE HAVE TO GO OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH WHAT IT IS WE NEED TO END. THIS IS GIMMICKS, INVASION, TURNING BACKS ON AMERICANS. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE THAT HAS OUTRAGED. -- HAS OUTRAGED ME. THERE'S A COMPANY IN WISCONSIN THAT MAKES AUTO PARTS. IN 2008, YOU MIGHT REMEMBER, THE AUTO INDUSTRY WAS ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE. THE REPUBLICAN SAID LET IT DIE-- REPUBLICANS SAID LET IT DIE. PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID, THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE'S JOBS. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. YOU AND I BAILED OUT THE AUTO INDUSTRY. IT TURNED OUT TO BE A GOOD INVESTMENT. THEY PAID IT BACK. ONE OF THOSE COPIES ASKING FOR HELP WITH JOHNSON CONTROLS-- WAS JOHNSON CONTROLS. AUTO HAS HAD THE BEST YEAR IN A WHILE DID THEY HAVE-- IN A WHILE. JOHNSON CONTROLS WILL PRETEND TO SELL ITSELF AND MOVE ITSELF TO EUROPE SO THAT IT CAN AVOID AMERICAN TAXES. IT IS USING THE TAXPAYERS THAT FAILED OUT. THIS IS NOT AN INVERSION, IT IS A PERMISSION. -- PERVERSION. I WILL GO AFTER THEM WHEN I AM PRESIDENT.   YOU SEE, I HAVE A BROADER VIEW ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE NOT ONLY PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE, BUT THEY DON'T WRECK THE ECONOMY LIKE WE SAW THEM IN 2008. THE GOVERNOR, SENATOR, AND I AGREE THAT WE HAVE GOT TO PREVENT WALL STREET, THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, AND OTHERS FROM DOING WHAT THEY DID. BUT, WE HAVE A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE COULD HAVE NO ARGUMENT -- DIFFERENCE. I HAVE NO ARGUMENT -- I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE NOW HAVE THE LAW. WE PASSED IT. THE DODD FRANK LAW. WE HAVE TO PULL THE TRIGGER ON THE PROCESS IF THE BANKS POSE A SYSTEMIC RISK. WE ARE KEEPING OUR EYES ON WHAT THE BANKS ARE DOING. THAT IS WHERE I PART COMPANY WITH MY TWO FRIENDS C. 2008 WAS NOT JUST THE BIG BANKS. THANK YOU. LEHMAN BROTHERS, AIG, COUNTRYWIDE MORTGAGE, BOKO WACHOVIA. IF ALL YOU DO IS TALK ABOUT THE BIG BANKS, YOU MISS THE BIG PICTURE. WE HAVE TO GO AFTER THE SHADOW BANKING INDUSTRY. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN'T HURT US. THAT IS WHAT I HAVE PLEDGED TO DO. INDEPENDENT OBSERVERS WHO HAVE LOOKED AT WHAT WE HAVE ALL PROPOSED HAVE ALL SAID, I AM THE TOUGHEST, MOST EFFECTIVE, MOST COMPREHENSIVE. PEOPLE LIKE PAUL KRUGMAN. THE BEST EVIDENCE, THE FOLKS THAT KNOW I HAVE THE TOUGHEST PLAN OTHER -- ARE THE REPUBLICANS. THEY ARE RUNNING $6 MILLION WITH OF ADS RIGHT NOW. HEDGE FUND GUYS HAVE STARTED A SUPER PAC TO RUN AGAINST ME. KARL ROVE. ANOTHER BILLIONAIRE JUST JUMPED INTO THE FRAY. ASK YOURSELF, WHY ARE THEY SO NERVOUS ABOUT ME? I WILL TELL YOU. THEY KNOW ME. THEY KNOW THAT I SAY WHAT I MEAN AND I DO WHAT I SAY. I KNOW HOW TO GO AFTER THEM.   WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE FIGHT TO THEM. WE CAN AND WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE PROGRESS. I AM A PROGRESSIVE WHO LIKES TO GET THINGS DONE. THAT IS WHAT I BELIEVE IN. THE DEBATE I AM HAVING WITH SENATOR SANDERS OVER HEALTH CARE IS IMPORTANT. WE BOTH HAVE THE SAME GOAL. UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. BEFORE, IT WAS OBAMACARE -- BEFORE WAS OBAMACARE, IT WAS HILLARY CARE. I WAS WORKING TO GET UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. THEY BEAT US, THE DARK --THE DRUG COMPANIES. THEY BEAT US. I GOT CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PASSED. I WAS THRILLED WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO THIS SINCE HARRY TRUMAN. WE KNOW WHAT THE ALTERNATIVE IS. REPUBLICANS WANT TO TURN IT BACK TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, SO THAT THEY CAN GO AND BASICALLY CHARGE WHAT THEY WANT, TO TYPE COVERAGE-- DENY PEOPLE COVERAGE, CHARGE WOMEN MORE, NOT LET YOUNG PEOPLE BE ON PARENTS POLICIES. I KNOW. TED CRUZ WAS CONFRONTED BY A MAN AT ONE OF HIS EVENTS TODAY WHO TOLD HIM ABOUT HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW WHO HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD INSURANCE. HE COULD NOT GO TO A DOCTOR. WHEN HE FINALLY DID, HE FOUND OUT HE WAS RIDDLED WITH CANCER. THE MAN SAID, WHY DO YOU WANT TO REPEAL THIS? FINALLY, PEOPLE LIKE MY BROTHER IN LAW CAN GET INSURANCE. TED CRUZ WENT OFF ON AN IDEOLOGICAL CRITICAL COMMENT ABOUT AFFORDABLE CARE. HE NEVER SAID WHAT THE ALTERNATIVE IS. ""WHAT WOULD YOU REPLACE IT WITH?"" THEY CAN TELL YOU. -- THEY CAN'T TELL YOU. THAT'S FINE WITH THEM. THAT'S NOT FINE WITH ME. I WILL NOT LET THAT HAPPEN.   WE HAVE FOUGHT TOO HARD AND TOO LONG. WE ARE AT 90% COVERAGE. I WILL FIX WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE WILL GO AFTER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. BUT, I WILL TELL YOU, WE CANNOT START OVER, MY FRIENDS. WE CANNOT THROW THIS COUNTRY BACK INTO GRIDLOCK. PEOPLE CANNOT WAIT FOR ANOTHER 20 OR DEBATE-- 20 YEAR DEBATE. IN WOMAN CAME TO SEE ME, SHE SAT LOOK AT THIS. SHE STARTED TAKING MEDICINE, 10 SHOTS, BACK IN 1988. ABOUT $10 A SHOT. IT STAYED PRETTY STEADY. LAST MONTH SHE WENT TO THE PHARMACIST TO GET HER SHOTS, AND THE PHARMACIST SAID IT WOULD COST HER MORE THAN $14,000 FOR THE SAME 10 SHOTS. I LOOKED AT THE LETTER, AND I SAID NO, HERE IS WHAT IS GOING ON. THERE ARE A LOT OF DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. THERE ARE NO NEW INVESTMENTS, THEY JUST MAKE THE SAME DRUG, THEY SELL IT, THEY MAKE A PROFIT. THEY JUST KEEP IT IN THE MARKETPLACE. A BUNCH OF HEDGE FUND GUYS AND SPECULATORS SAID THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR US. THEY STARTED TO BUY THESE LITTLE COMPANIES, AND THEN PEOPLE NEEDED THEM, AND THEY BEGAN INCREASING THE PRICE THROUGH THE ROOF. VALIANT PHARMACEUTICALS IS ONE OF THOSE THAT IS DOING THIS. GOBBLING UP DRUGS THAT ARE ALREADY OUT THERE, AND THEN CHARGING MORE THAN PEOPLE CAN PAY. I THINK WE NEED TO CALL IT WHAT IT IS. IT IS PREDATORY PRICING. WE NEED EVERY TOOL AT OUR LEGAL DISPOSAL TO SHUT THIS DOWN.  I WILL GO AFTER THEM, I WILL PREVENT THEM FROM DOING THIS TO PEOPLE.  SOMEBODY SAID TO ME, I HAVE BEEN RAILING ABOUT THIS FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS, SOMEBODY SAID THEIR STOCK PRICE FELL, AND I SAID GOOD, I HOPE THEY GET THE MESSAGE RATE I WILL NOT LET THIS HAPPEN. THEN I WAS IN DAVENPORT, AND A MAN SAID THANK YOU FOR DEFENDING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. YET A GRANDCHILD -- HE HAD A GRANDCHILD BORN WITH A CONGENITAL HEART DEFECT. SHE HAS HAD FIVE OPERATIONS. UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT FROM A LIFETIME LIMITS WERE REMOVED SO THEY COULD GET THE INSURANCE THEY NEEDED FOR SOMETHING AS SERIOUS AS OPEN-HEART SURGERY ON A CHILD. JUST YESTERDAY I WAS IN DES MOINES, AND I MET A WOMAN BEFORE IT WENT OUT TO SPEAK AND SHE SAID I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR DEFENDING THE REPORTABLE CARE ACT -- AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IM DOING IT BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN IT AND IT IS THE BEST SHOT WE HAVE. SHE SAID JUST A FEW YEARS AGO MY DAUGHTER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN CANCER, AND BECAUSE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, I COULD PUT HER ON MY POLICY. WE BEGAN HER TREATMENT. SHE GOT REALLY SICK, AND I HAD TO QUIT MY JOB. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO, BUT THAT I COULD GO INTO THE MARKETPLACE AND I COULD GET INSURANCE THAT WOULD COVER ME. THIS WOMAN TOLD ME THIS HEARTRENDING STORY ABOUT HER DAUGHTER, AND A HAPPY ENDING. HER DAUGHTER JUST GOT MARRIED.  BUT SHE DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT FOR HER TREATMENT AND INSURANCE. WE CANNOT REPEAL IT, AND WE CANNOT START OVER. WE HAVE TO BUILD ON IT, MAKE IT WORK, AND GET US TO 100%. IT IS A LOT EASIER TO GET FROM 90% TO 100% THEN TO GO FROM 0% TO 100%.  I WANT TO THANK ALL THE TEACHERS, THE RETIRED TEACHERS WHO ARE HERE TONIGHT.  I AM SO PROUD TO HAVE YOUR ENDORSEMENT, AND I WILL BE YOUR APARTMENT -- YOUR PARTNER. WE WILL WORK TOGETHER FOR EDUCATION FOR OUR KIDS. WE NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S NEEDS. I HAVE THE MOST HEARTBREAKING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT TEACHERS AS I TRAVELED ACROSS THE STATE. TEACHERS HAVE RAISED THEIR HANDS IN MY MEETINGS AND THEY HAVE SAID IT HAS BEEN BELOW ZERO. A TEACHER WAS SAYING THIS, AND A LITTLE KID COMES TO SCHOOL WITH A T-SHIRT ON. I KNOW THAT IS FAMILIES HAVING SUCH A HARD TIME, WE TRY TO HELP. TEACHERS DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THEIR JOB IS TO IMPART KNOWLEDGE, ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE. THE TEACHERS I KNOW BELIEVE THAT THEIR JOB IS TO LIFT THAT EACH CHILD, TO GIVE EVERY SINGLE CHILD A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL.  HERE ARE SOME THINGS I THINK WOULD HELP. WE NEED EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. ZERO YEARS OLD TO FIVE YEARS OLD. THIS WOULD HELP PREPARE SO MANY MORE KIDS TO BE SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY GOT TO SCHOOL. WE NEED MORE WRAPAROUND SERVICES IN SCHOOL. WE NEED TO GET NURSES BACK IN SCHOOLS. WE NEED SOCIAL WORKERS, WE NEED PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS THAT KIDS ARE BRINGING TO SCHOOL.  AND WE NEED TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AGAIN FOR EVERY YOUNG PERSON IN AMERICA.  I HAVE A PLAN TO DO THAT. I HAVE LAID OUT MY PLAN. I HAVE TOLD YOU HOW MUCH AND WHAT KOCH -- IT WOULD COST. I WANT DEBT FREE TUITION. HERE IS THE DIFFERENCE. I WOULD ANYBODY WHO CANNOT AFFORD IT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE TUITION WITHOUT BORROWING ANYTHING. I DO NOT BELIEVE GIVING FREE COLLEGE TO DONALD TRUMP'S YOUNGEST CHILD IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF ALL THE HARD-WORKING AMERICANS WHO NEED HELP.  I THINK WE CAN DO IT IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY BY, NUMBER ONE, ASKING THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO TAKE A LOOK HARD LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE CHARGING. BECAUSE OF ALL YOU DO IS HAVE A BIG GLUT OF FREE MONEY, THE COSTS ARE GOING TO KEEP GOING UP BECAUSE THERE IS NO INCENTIVE TO REIN THEM IN. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEY CANNOT JUST DUMP EVERYTHING ON TUITION. WE HAVE TO LIVE AWAY FROM THAT. WE ALSO HAVE TO GET STATES -- I WANT A PARTNERSHIP WITH STATE. I WANTED TO QUIT BUILDING PRISONS AND START PUTTING MONEY BACK INTO EDUCATION, INCLUDING HIGHER EDUCATION.  AND I BELIEVE, I BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU ARE GOING TO COLLEGE, AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS DEBT FREE TUITION, TO WORK 10 HOURS A WEEK. MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A CONTRIBUTION, SO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE INVESTED IN THIS. AND THEN WHEN YOU GET OUT, IF YOU HAVE DEBT, I BELIEVE WE SHOULD LET YOU REFINANCE YOUR DEBT AND SAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, GIVE THAT PAYMENT DOWN, GET IT OFF WITH AN INTEREST RATE, GIVEN AS A PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME. THAT WILL MAKE IT AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEBT RIGHT NOW TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT FROM UNDER US. -- UNDER IT.  THERE IS A LOT OF WORK FOR US TO DO HERE. I AM VERY COMMITTED TO FIGHTING HARD ON ALL OF THESE FRIENDS HERE AT HOME. THERE IS ANOTHER BIG GROUP OF ISSUES I DISAGREE FUNDAMENTALLY WITH THE REPUBLICANS OVER. THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY EVERYBODY'S RIGHTS. HUMANS RIGHTS, CIVIL RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHTS, GAY RIGHTS, WORKERS RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS. THAT IS RIPPING OUT THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE. I WILL TELL YOU WHERE I STAND. I SUPPORT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN CHOICES ABOUT HEALTH CARE.  I SUPPORT PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND WILL FIGHT AGAINST THIS BEING DEFUNDED.  I SUPPORT MARRIAGE EQUALITY, AND I WILL WORK AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY.  I SUPPORT VOTING RUNS, AND I WILL WORK TO OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED, AND GET THE CORRUPT MONEY OUT OF POLITICS. I SUPPORT UNIONS AND WORKERS RIGHTS. THEY BUILT THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS, AND THEY ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR FUTURE. I SUPPORT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, AND I WILL WORK TO TRY TO HEAL THE BLOWS THAT WE HAVE SEEN BETWEEN OUR RACES AND PEOPLE ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO END THE ERA OF MASS INCARCERATION AND PROVIDE SECOND CHANCES AND MORE OPPORTUNITY.  I WILL DEFEND SOCIAL SECURITY AGAINST PRIVATIZATION, THE BIGGEST WALL STREET GIVEAWAY YET TO THE REPUBLICANS HAVE PROPOSED. I WILL FIX THE V.A., BUT I WILL NOT LET THE REPUBLICANS PRIVATIZE THE V.A. AND TAKE AWAY THE GUARANTEE OF HEALTH CARE FOR AMERICAN VETERANS.  AND I WILL FIGHT FOR COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY MEASURES AGAINST THE GUN LOBBY.  YOU KNOW, THIS MORNING IN AMES, IOWA, I WAS ENDORSED BY GABBY GIFFORDS AND HER WONDERFUL HUSBAND MARK KELLY. I WILL TELL YOU, THE COURAGE AND COMMITMENT OF THOSE TWO WONDERFUL AMERICANS IS SO ONE OVERWHELMING. TO SEE IT IN PERSON. TO SEE THIS WOMAN, WHO I KNEW BEFORE SHE WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD, WHILE MEETING WITH HER CAN DO TO US IN THE PARKING LOT OF A SHOPPING CENTER, AND OTHERS WHO WERE THERE TO MEET WITH HER. A LITTLE NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO HAD COME TO MEET HER CONGRESS MEMBER WAS KILLED. AND MARK KELLY, WHO SERVED OUR NATION 25 YEARS IN THE MILITARY. SERVED AS AN ASTRONAUT ON THE SPACE SHUTTLE. HE SAID I'M NOT POLITICAL, I WAS NEVER INVOLVED IN THAT, I JUST SERVED MY COUNTRY. HE SAID WE CANNOT GO ON LIKE THIS. THIS IS WRONG. 90 PEOPLE ON AVERAGE A DAY DIED FROM GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA. THAT IS 33,000 PEOPLE A YEAR. HOMICIDE, SUICIDE, TERRIBLE, AVOIDABLE ACTIONS. COMMON SENSE GUN REFORM, LIKE BACKGROUND CHECKS, CLOSING LOOPHOLES, NOT LETTING PEOPLE ON THE NO-FLY LIST BY GUNS IN AMERICA. IF THEY ARE TOO DANGEROUS TO FLY, THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE A GUN, FOR HEAVENS TAKE. -- SAKE. THESE PROPOSALS ARE SUPPORTED BY 92% OF AMERICANS, AND 82% OF GUN OWNERS. I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO GUN OWNERS. THEY SAY I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT, THEY JUST WANT YOU TO DO IT SO IT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH MY RIGHTS. I SAY ABSOLUTELY. YOU HAVE RIGHTS. IT HAS TO BE DONE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONSTITUTION. BUT DON'T YOU THINK WE ARE SMART ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT? MORE THAN 2 MILLION PURCHASES HAVE BEEN PROHIBITIVE BECAUSE OF THE BRADY ACT THAT WAS PASSED WHILE MY HUSBAND WAS PRESIDENT.  I HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER THIS AS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY PEOPLE DYING. WE CANNOT STOP EVERY DEATH, I AM NOT CLAIMING THAT, BUT WE OUGHT TO TRY. I THINK WE CAN. LET ME SAY I FINAL WORD ABOUT SAFETY HERE AT HOME. I WAS A SENATOR ON 9/11, I FEEL PASSIONATELY ABOUT DEFENDING OUR COUNTRY, KEEPING US SAFE FROM TERRORISTS AND OTHERS WHO WISH US HARM. I LAID OUT A PLAN ON HOW I WOULD DO THAT. A HOW I WOULD DEFEAT ISIS, HOWEVER MAKE SURE THAT WE LEAD A COALITION OF AIR POWER TO HELP BACK UP THE ARABS AND THE KURDS WHO HAVE TO DO THE FIGHTING, BECAUSE I WILL NOT SEND AMERICAN COMBAT TROOPS BACK TO SYRIA OR IRAN.  WE ALSO HAVE TO TAKE THEM ON, PREVENTING THEIR FOREIGN FIGHTERS, THERE FOR 20, AND TAKE THEM ON ONLINE. AND WE ALSO HAVE TO PULL TOGETHER IN OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE. AFTER 9/11, WE HAD A PLAN. IT WAS AN INFORMATIONAL PROGRAM. IF YOU SEE SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS, OR YOU HEAR SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS, CALL SOMEBODY. CALL THE POLICE, CALL THE FBI , CALL 911. IT RELIED ON EVERYBODY BEING ON THE SAME SIZE, KNOWING THAT WE WERE GOING TO PROTECT ALL OF US AGAINST ANY TERROR ATTACK. AND WE DID, WE GOT INFORMATION THAT FOILED ATTACKS, AND BROKE THEM UP, AND I THINK IT WORKED BECAUSE EVERYBODY FELT LIKE THEY WERE PART OF IT. WHEN YOU HEAR LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES SAY WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT AMERICAN MUSLIMS, HERE IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO THINK. IT IS NOT ONLY OFFENSIVE, AND CONTRARY TO OUR VALUES, BUT IT IS DANGEROUS. IT IS A DANGEROUS POSITION TO BE TAKING.  ALL OF A SUDDEN, SOME AMERICANS ARE MADE TO FEEL LIKE THEY ARE OUTSIDE OF THE CIRCLE. THEY ARE NOT WANTED. THEIR INFORMATION IS NOT NEEDED. THE OLDEST MOSQUE IN AMERICA IS HERE IN CEDAR RAPIDS, IOWA.  YOU KNOW PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHO ARE YOUR NEIGHBORS, PEOPLE WHO ARE YOUR COLLEAGUES. WE NEED TO ALL BE IN THIS TOGETHER. AND THEN WE HAVE TO HAVE A COALITION OF NATIONS, INCLUDING MUSLIM NATIONS, TO DEFEAT THE THREAT OF TERRORISM. I'VE PUT TOGETHER A COALITION, I PUT TOGETHER THE COALITION THAT IMPOSED SANCTIONS ON IRAN, THAT DROVE THEM TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE, GOT THE AGREEMENT THAT PUT THE LID ON THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM. I KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO BUILD A COALITION, AND I CAN TELL YOU THIS --  IT IS A LOT HARDER TO BUILD A COALITION WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE RUNNING FROM UNITED THEY RESIDENCY OR INSULTING RELIGION OF THE PEOPLE WE NEED TO BUILD A COALITION.  THIS CAMPAIGN IS LIKE A JOB INTERVIEW. YOU ALL HAVE TO DECIDE, WHO IS READY TO BE PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF ON DAY ONE OF JANUARY 2017. AND IF YOU WILL GO CAUCUS FOR ME ON MONDAY NIGHT, IF YOU WILL GO STAND UP FOR ME, IF YOU WILL BE THERE FOR ME, I PROMISE YOU THIS -- I WILL STAND FOR YOU, I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU THROUGH THIS CAMPAIGN, AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE I WILL WORK MY HEART OUT FOR YOU FOR THE KIND OF FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY THAT WE ALL DESERVE AND WANT. THANK YOU ALL, AND GOD BLESS YOU.  ","Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa"

IT WAS SO OVERWHELMING BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE TREATED LIKE THEY WERE NOT EVEN FULL HUMAN BEINGS.  BILL ASKED ME TO LEAD OUR EFFORTS TO SEEP WE COULD GET QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY AMERICAN. NOW IS OUR CHANCE TO GIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HEALTH SECURITY. WE WORKED REALLY HARD. WE WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL WHICH DISAPPOINTED, BUT YOU HAVE TO GET UP OFF THE FLOOR AND KEEP FIGHTING. I WANTED TO SEE WHAT WE COULD DO TO HELP KIDS.  I AM OVERCOME BY THE COURAGE AND COMPASSION. I KNEW I HAD TO ALSO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN.  HE WON AND I LOST. WE BOTH LOVE OUR COUNTRY.  EVERYONE DESERVES A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER VALUE AND POTENTIAL. THAT IS A DREAM WE SHARE. THAT IS THE FIGHT WE MUST WAGE. MY MOM NEVER GOT TO GO TO COLLEGE. EVERYDAY AMERICANS AND THEIR FAMILIES NEED A CHANCE. WE FIGHT FOR THEM EVERY DAY. I WANT TO BE THAT CHANCE. I WILL GET UP EVERY DAY GOING TO WORK FOR YOU, STANDING UP FOR YOU. I THINK RIGHT NOW PEOPLE KNOW I DON'T QUIT.     THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. THANK YOU! YOU ARE GREAT. THANK YOU. OH, MY GOODNESS. I TELL YOU, IT WAS WORTH IT, TRYING TO GET HERE. YOU HAVE BEEN SO GENEROUS WITH YOUR TIME. I AM SO GRATEFUL TO BE BACK IN MARSHALLTOWN AND HAVE THIS CHANCE TO TALK WITH YOU, NOW LESS THAN A WEEK UNTIL THE CAUCUS ON MONDAY NIGHT. BUT IT IS REALLY MEANINGFUL TO ME THAT YOU WOULD BE HERE AND BE PART OF THIS PROCESS. I REALLY AM GRATEFUL TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. I HAVE LEARNED A LOT IN THE LAST MONTH. I REALLY THINK SPENDING ALL THIS TIME IN SMALL GROUPS AND BIG ONES IS GOING TO MAKE ME A BETTER PRESIDENT, SO I THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE TO MAKE THAT POSSIBLE.   I REALLY WANT TO THANK MARK SMITH FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT. I AM THRILLED. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH, REPRESENTATIVE. I HAVE A PLAN I HOPE WILL COME TO PASS THAT AFFECTS MARK. AND THAT IS, I HOPE WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE HIM THE MAJORITY LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. THINK OF ALL THE GOOD THINGS HE COULD DO FOR YOU AND PEOPLE ACROSS IOWA. WELL, IT IS GETTING CLOSE. AND WHEN ALL OF YOU DECIDE TO GO CAUCUS ON MONDAY, YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE FIRST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TO GET TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ABOUT WHO SHOULD BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF FOR OUR COUNTRY. I KNOW HOW SERIOUSLY ISLANDS -- IOWANS TAKE THIS BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO AND LISTENING TO YOU. I WANT TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES DISCUSSING WHAT IS AT STAKE BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTIONS WE HAVE HAD IN SOME TIME. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THERE ARE SOME VERY BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN US AND THE REPUBLICANS. THAT PUTS A SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY ON YOU AND VOTERS TO TRY TO DECIDE WHERE YOU STAND. I WILL TELL YOU WHERE I STAND. I BELIEVE THE REPUBLICAN POLICIES THAT ARE BEING PROMOTED BY THIS CROP OF CANDIDATES THAT ARE TRAVELING ACROSS OUR STATE AND COUNTRY WOULD SET OUR COUNTRY BACK, RIP UP THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE, AND UNDERMINE OUR FUTURE. AND THAT IS TRUE ACROSS THE BOARD. BUT LET ME PICK A FEW OF THESE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES. LET'S TAKE THE ECONOMY. YOU HAVE HEARD FROM THEM. THEY ARE SPOUTING THE SAME FAILED ECONOMIC POLICIES, TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS, CUT TAXES ON THE WEALTHY, GET OUT OF THE WAY OF CORPORATIONS. WE HAVE TRIED THAT. IT DOES NOT WORK. IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE FACTS. THE FACTS ARE OUR ECONOMY DOES BETTER WHEN WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO CARES ABOUT CREATING JOBS AND RAISING INCOMES FOR AMERICANS.   THE LAST TWO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS WE HAVE HAD, BOTH OF WHOM I KNOW, WHICH I KIND OF AN PROUD OF. THEY EACH INHERITED ECONOMIC PROBLEMS FROM THEIR REPUBLICAN PREDECESSORS. IN MY HUSBAND'S CASE, IT WAS A RECESSION. A HUGE NATIONAL DEBT THAT HAD BEEN QUADRUPLED IN THE PRIOR 12 YEARS AND A BIG DEFICIT. WHEN HE GOT TO WASHINGTON, PEOPLE SAID, WHAT DO YOU ESPECIALLY BRING TO WASHINGTON THAT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE? HE SAID I GUESS I BRING ARITHMETIC. WE WILL MAKE IT OUT OF BEGIN FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AT THE END OF EIGHT YEARS, WE DID. 23 MILLION NEW JOBS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, INCOMES WENT UP FOR EVERYBODY. NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. HARD-WORKING MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES, WORKING FAMILIES, FOR FAMILIES. MORE PEOPLE WERE LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY THEN IN RECENT TIME IN OUR HISTORY. AND WE ENDED UP WITH A BALANCED BUDGET AND A SURPLUS. WE WERE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. WELL, BACK CAME THE REPUBLICANS AND THAT CAME TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS. GEORGE W. BUSH/TAXES ON THE WEALTHY -- GEORGE W. BUSH SLASHED TAXES ON THE WEALTHY GOT OUT OF THE WAY OF THE CORPORATIONS. THE MAN HE PUT IN CHARGE OF KEEPING AN EYE ON WALL STREET TOOK A CHAINSAW TO A BIG STACK OF REGULATIONS AND HAD A GREAT BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE. NOW WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, DON'T WE? WE WENT INTO THE GREATEST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. AND WHEN BARACK OBAMA BECAME PRESIDENT, WE WERE LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH. I DON'T THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA GETS THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR DIGGING US OUT ABOUT BIG DITCH THE REPUBLICANS PUT US IN DURING THEIR ADMINISTRATION.   AND IT WAS NOT EASY. I KNOW, I TALKED TO HIM ABOUT IT. WHEN HE ASKED ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE, HE SAID WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY AT HOME. WE HAVE TO FIX THE PROBLEMS WE INHERITED AROUND THE WORLD. WHAT DID HE DO? WELL, WE ARE BACK ON TRACK WITH 14 MILLION NEW JOBS. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS PASSED. WE ARE NOW AT 90% HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IN AMERICA FOR THE FIRST TIME. HE PASSED AND SIGNED THE TOUGHEST REGULATIONS ON WALL STREET SINCE THE 1930'S, THE DODD-FRANK LAW. SAVED THE AUTO INDUSTRY WHICH WAS ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE, WHICH WOULD HAVE TAKEN ANOTHER COUPLE OF MILLION JOBS DOWN WITH THEM. WE ENDED UP LOSING 9 MILLION BECAUSE OF THAT GREAT RECESSION. 5 MILLION HOMES WERE LOST AND $13 TRILLION IN FAMILY WEALTH WAS WIPED OUT. IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK THERE, YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF FOLKS, INCLUDING ONE HERE TODAY, WHO ARE SPOUTING THAT SAME STUFF BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE WE WILL END UP AGAIN. IN FACT, YOU ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SEE A RECESSION IN AMERICA WHEN YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO BE AT THE CORE OF THIS ELECTION. YOU SHOULD ASK EVERYBODY RUNNING WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT. I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU, I AM PROUD OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. WE HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES, BUT WE HAVE DIFFERENCES OVER ISSUES AND THAT IS WHAT WE TALK ABOUT. NOT INSULTS, WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS AMONG THE REPUBLICANS. SO I PUT OUT A PLAN. HERE IS WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO DO. WE NEED MORE INFRASTRUCTURE JOBS. OUR ROADS, BRIDGES, TUNNELS, PORTS, RAIL SYSTEMS, SEWER SYSTEMS, WATER SYSTEMS. WE HAVE WORK TO DO IN OUR COUNTRY, AND THOSE ARE JOBS THAT CANNOT BE EXPORTED. THEY NEED TO BE GUN RIGHT HERE. PUT AMERICANS -- THEY NEED TO BE DONE RIGHT HERE. PUT AMERICANS BACK TO WORK BUILDING OUR ECONOMY, MAKING US MORE COMPETITIVE. AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE TAX SYSTEM AND GET RID OF THE INCENTIVES THAT ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TAKE JOBS AND MOVE THEM OVERSEAS, TAKE FACTORIES AND BUILD THEM OVERSEAS. WE ARE GOING TO REVERSE THAT SO WE START INVESTING IN AMERICA AGAIN. ADVANCED MANUFACTURING. I KNOW IT CAN BE DONE BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN TO SOME OF YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I HAVE SEEN THE WORK HAPPENING THERE, THE TRAINING GOING ON. I ALSO KNOW IT CAN BE DONE BECAUSE WHILE WE ARE GOING TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE, WE ARE GOING TO CREATE MORE CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY JOBS. THAT WILL BE A HUGE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY.   THAT IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING. THE REPUBLICANS, WHEN YOU ASK THEM ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, THEY ALL SAID THE SAME THING. ""I DON'T KNOW, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST."" THERE IS AN EASY WAY TO REMEDY THAT. GO TALK TO A SCIENTIST, LEARN ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON. THAT IS BAD ENOUGH THAT THEY ARE IN DENIAL. WHAT IS REALLY TROUBLING IS THEY ARE MISSING THIS HUGE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. WHEN I TELL PEOPLE THAT, I SEE SOMETIMES FOLKS AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SKEPTICISM ON THEIR FACES. HERE IS WHAT I TELL THEM. I KNOW WE CAN CREATE THOSE JOBS BECAUSE LOOK AT WHAT IOWA HAS DONE. I WANT YOU TO THANK REPRESENTATIVE SMITH. THANK YOU. IT STARTED WITH TOM BUILDS BACK AND THE DEMOCRATS -- TOM VILSACK AND THE DEMOCRATS MAKING A COMMITMENT. YOU HAVE 7000 PEOPLE ALREADY WORKING IN THE WIND INDUSTRY IN THIS STATE. YOU ARE DOING RESEARCH ON ADVANCED BIOFUELS THAT THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT THINKS MAY BE ABLE TO FUEL VESSELS THE U.S. NAVY VESSELS AND AIR FORCE PLANES. IOWA IS IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE ENERGY REVOLUTION BECAUSE SOME COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE THE 21ST CENTURY CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER. IT IS EITHER GOING TO BE CHINA, GERMANY, OR US. I WANT IT TO BE US. WE NEED TO MAKE UP OUR MINDS IT IS GOING TO BE US AND WE ARE GOING TO BE DOING THE TECHNOLOGY, INNOVATION, AND EXPORTING TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. WE ALSO NEED TO BE FOCUSING ON SMALL BUSINESS BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE MOST OF THE JOBS COME FROM IN AMERICA. I WANT TO BE THE SMALL BUSINESS PRESIDENT. MY DAD WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN. I WANT TO CLEAR AWAY THE UNDERBRUSH SO PEOPLE CAN START BUSINESSES AGAIN. ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE. A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE TELL ME THEY WOULD LOVE TO GO INTO BUSINESS, BUT THEY CANNOT GET CREDIT. PART OF IT IS THEY HAVE SUCH STUDENT DEBTS THEY CANNOT GET CREDIT. WE HAVE TO FIX THAT. WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER TO START AND GROW A SMALL BUSINESS. THERE ARE TWO WAYS WE CAN RAISE INCOMES REAL QUICK. ONE, WE HAVE GOT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. PEOPLE WHO WORK FULL-TIME SHOULD NOT STILL BE IN POVERTY.  THERE SHOULD BE A LADDER OF OPPORTUNITY. THE OTHER WAY IS TO GUARANTEE EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN'S WORK. THAT WILL RAISE INCOMES AND FAMILIES WILL BE BETTER OFF, THE ECONOMY WILL BE.   EVERYTHING I HAVE JUST SAID TO YOU THE REPUBLICANS DO NOT AGREE WITH IT, EVERY BIT OF IT. THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN ANY OF IT. THEY DON'T REALLY TELL YOU WHAT THEY WILL DO EXCEPT GET OUT OF THE WAY AND LET CORPORATIONS DO WHAT EVER THEY WANT -- WHATEVER THEY WANT AND LET THEIR BIG DONORS DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. THAT IS NOT GOING TO WORK. WE KNOW IT WON'T. WE CAN'T BE SOLD THAT BILL OF GOODS AGAIN. THE OTHER THING WE HAVE TO DO IS TO CHANGE THE TAX SYSTEM SO THAT IT IS FAIRER. I AM THE ONLY CANDIDATE RUNNING ON EITHER SIDE WHO HAS MADE THIS PLEDGE. I WILL RAISE YOUR INCOMES. I WILL NOT RAISE MIDDLE-CLASS TAXES. I DO NOT THINK IT IS RIGHT TO BE GOING TO PEOPLE WHO SUFFERED BECAUSE OF THE REPUBLICAN RECESSION AND ASKING FOR YOU TO HELP US MAKE THE INVESTMENTS FOR THE FUTURE. I WANT YOU TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM, BUT I WANT TO GO WHERE THE MONEY IS. THE MONEY IS AT THE TOP. THAT IS WHERE WE NEED TO BE SHIFTING OUR TAX SYSTEM. WE NEED TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES AND THE SPECIAL GIMMICKS CORPORATIONS AND THE WEALTHY USE, LIKE THIS THING CALLED THE CARRIED INTEREST LOOPHOLE THAT I HAVE BEEN AGAINST FOR YEARS. WE ALSO NEED TO DO WHAT WARREN BUFFETT SUGGESTED. I WAS REALLY VERY HAPPY HE ENDORSED ME. I WENT TO OMAHA WITH HIM. WE WERE STANDING THERE --   HE SAID, YOU KNOW, I AM NOT TOO POPULAR AMONG MY RICH FRIENDS THESE DAYS BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE LIKE ME SHOULD PAY MORE MONEY INTO OUR TAX SYSTEM TO SUPPORT OUR COUNTRY. HE HAS SOMETHING HE CALLS THE BUFFET RULE. ANYBODY WHO MAKES $1 MILLION SHOULD HAVE TO PAY A 30% EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. I HAVE ADOPTED THE BUFFET RULE. WE WILL TRY TO GET THAT DONE.  THEN I WANT TO GO FURTHER, I WANT TO IMPOSE WHAT I CALL A FAIR SHARE SURCHARGE ON INCOMES OF $5 MILLION OR MORE. THERE ARE NOT VERY MANY OF THOSE, BUT THERE IS A LOT OF MONEY THERE. I WANT TO USE THAT MONEY TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE. I WANT TO USE THAT MONEY TO INVEST IN CLEAN ENERGY. I WANT TO USE THAT MONEY TO MOVE TOWARD PAID FAMILY LEAVE SO FAMILIES GET MORE SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR WORK AT HOME AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES. I WANT TO USE THAT MONEY TO BRING DOWN THE COST OF CHILDCARE , WHICH IN SOME STATES IS AS EXPENSIVE AS COLLEGE TUITION. THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO THAT WILL RELIEVE THE BURDEN ON MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES, AND THE MONEY SHOULD COME FROM THOSE WHO HAVE IT. PEOPLE SAY, HOW WILL WE GET THAT DONE? I HAVE A POLITICAL STRATEGY. I'VE SEEN A BIT OF THIS IN THE LAST 20 PLUS YEARS. THERE ARE NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO MAKE $5 MILLION OR MORE IN AMERICA. I THINK WE CAN MAKE A VERY CLEAR CASE, MR. CONGRESSMAN OVER THERE, ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF CLEAN ENERGY, AFFORDABLE COLLEGE? ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION? THE WAY WE ARE GOING TO GET IT IS TO TAX THE TWO IN YOUR DISTRICT WHO MAKE MORE THAN $5 MILLION. OR ARE YOU GOING TO DENY THAT TO THE 350,000 PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN YOUR DISTRICT? WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A TOUGH CASE ABOUT WHY WE HAVE TO MAKE THE TAX CODE FAIRER. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT IT, BUT I HAVE A PLAN TO DO IT, NOT JUST A PLAN OF SUBSTANCE, BUT A POLITICAL PLAN. BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT I AIM TO DO FOR YOU AND WHAT IT WILL COST YOU. I WANT EVERYBODY TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT AND MAKE YOUR OWN JUDGMENT. I ALSO HAVE WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE TOUGHEST, MOST EFFECTIVE, COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO GO AFTER WALL STREET. I TOTALLY AGREE WITH MY ESTEEMED OPPONENTS, SENATOR SANDERS AND GOVERNOR O'MALLEY, THAT WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP OUR EYES ON THE BIG BANKS. AND NO BANK IS TOO BIG TO FAIL, AND NO EXECUTIVE IS TOO POWERFUL TO JAIL. BUT WE ARE TO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GO AFTER THEM. THAT WAS IN THE DODD FRANK BILL. WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. WE JUST HAVE TO IMPLEMENT IT. I HAVE SAID IF THEY POSE A SYSTEMIC RISK TO OUR ECONOMY, AND WILL GO AFTER THEM. I WILL USE THE PROCESS PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED INTO LAW. BUT HERE IS WHERE I DIFFER WITH MY TWO FRIENDS. THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ARGUING ABOUT ON THE DEBATE STAGE. IT WAS NOT JUST THE BIG BANKS THAT CAUSED OUR PROBLEMS. IT WAS AN INVESTMENT BANK LIKE LEHMAN BROTHERS. IT WAS A BIG INSURANCE CONGLOMERATE CALLED A.I.G. IT WAS A MORTGAGE COMPANY CALLED COUNTRYWIDE. IT WAS ANOTHER BANK, NOT ONE OF THE BIG FIVE, AND OTHERS WHO ARE WHAT IS CALLED THE SHADOW BAKING SECTOR --BANKING SECTOR. I SAID WE ARE GOING AFTER RISK WHEREVER IT IS IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. PAUL KRUGMAN, THE NOBEL PRIZE-WINNING ECONOMIST, SAID I HAVE THE BEST PLAN. BARNEY FRANK, WHO IS THE FRANK IN DODD-FRANK, SET I HAVE THE BEST PLAN BECAUSE I AM TRYING TO LOOK AT NOT JUST WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN BUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE. THE BEST EVIDENCE I HAVE THAT I HAVE THE BEST PLAN IS THAT THE REPUBLICANS AND THEIR BILLIONAIRE ALLIES ARE RUNNING ADS AGAINST ME. IT STARTED A FEW WEEKS AGO. THESE TWO HEDGE FUND BILLIONAIRES FORMED A SUPER PAC TO RUN AS AGAINST ME TO CONVINCE THEM ACROSS NOT TO SUPPORT ME. ALONG CAN KARL ROVE -- ALONG CAME KARL ROVE, THE AIR AND BOY FOR THE BILLIONAIRES. HE IS NOW RUNNING AN AD AGAINST ME. I ANOTHER BILLIONAIRE HAS JUMPED IN. AND HE IS NOW RUNNING AN AD AGAINST ME. YOU'VE GOT TO STOP AND THINK, WHY ARE THEY SPENDING ALL THIS MONEY TO CONVINCE THEM ACROSS NOT TO SUPPORT ME? I THINK YOU KNOW THE ANSWER. BECAUSE THEY KNOW I SAY WHAT I MEAN, I DO WHAT I SAY I WILL DO, AND I KNOW HOW TO GET IT DONE, TO PREVENT THEM FROM PUSHING AN AGENDA ON US THAT HURTS THE ECONOMY.   ANOTHER AREA WHERE I HAVE VERY STRONG FEELINGS AND SHARE EXACTLY THE SINGLE A SENATOR SANDERS IS HEALTH CARE -- THE SAME GOAL AS SENATOR SANDERS IS HEALTH CARE. I BELIEVE IN UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD HAVE IT. BEFORE IT WAS CALLED OBAMACARE, IT WAS CALLED HILLARYCARE WHEN I WAS TRYING TO GET UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. WE WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL. THAT WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTING. THE DRUG COMPANIES, THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AGAINST US -- SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AGAINST US. SO WE DID NOT SUCCEED. I GOT TO THINKING, WHAT CAN I DO NOW? MY VIEW IS WHEN YOU ARE KNOCKED DOWN, YOU SHARE THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE WITH EVERYBODY GETS KNOCKED DOWN ABOUT SOMETHING. THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER YOU GET BACK UP. I STARTED THINKING, WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP 70 MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR LIVES? I REMEMBER AND I WAS TRAVELING AROUND THE COUNTRY TRYING TO GET UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, MEETING SO MANY PEOPLE WHO DID NOT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE PER THEY COULD NOT AFFORD IT. THEY HAD A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AND THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULD NOT GIVE IT TO THEM. I MET SO MANY REALLY GOOD, DECENT PEOPLE SO OVERWHELMED BY WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO THEM. I REMEMBER I WAS AT THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN CLEVELAND MEETING WITH A GROUP OF PARENTS WHOSE KIDS WERE REALLY SICK WITH CHRONIC DISEASES. ONE MAN SAID TO ME I HAVE GONE EVERYWHERE TO TRY TO GET INSURANCE FOR MY DAUGHTER'S. I HAVE TWO GIRLS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS, AND NOBODY WILL SELL IT TO ME.  WHEN YOU RUN INTO A PROBLEM, YOU HAVE GOT TO KEEP GOING. YOU CANNOT EVER STOP. IF YOU ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP OTHER PEOPLE. I WAS THRILLED WHEN THE PRESIDENT PASSED AND SIGNED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THAT, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET THAT ACCOMPLISHED SINCE HARRY TRUMAN. AND NOW, I MEET PEOPLE ALL THE TIME WHO ARE BENEFITING FROM IT. I WANT TO BUILD ON IT, AND I WANT TO IMPROVE IT. REPUBLICANS WANT TO REPEAL IT. THAT IS WHAT THEY WILL DO IF THEY GET THE WHITE HOUSE BACK. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO DO. I WANT TO DECREASE COSTS, OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS. DECREASE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS.   I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE AUTHORITY FOR MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE FOR LOWER DRUG COSTS WITH THE DRUG COMPANIES. I WANT TO GO AFTER THE PREDATORY PRICING DRUG COMPANIES ARE USING TO RAISE THE PRICE OF DRUGS. I WANT TO TAKE AWAY THEIR TAX BENEFITS. THEY GET A TAX BENEFIT FOR ADVERTISING ALL THAT STUFF ON TV TO US. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. THEY HAVE PEOPLE WALKING THROUGH FIELDS OF WILDFLOWERS, BLOCKING ON BEACHES. THEY HAVE THE NAME OF THE DRUG WHICH IS UNPRONOUNCEABLE. AND THEN UNDER THE MUSIC, THEY HAVE SOMEBODY SAYING IF YOU TAKE THIS DRUG YOUR NOSE WILL FALL OFF.   IT DRIVE YOU CRAZY. THEY SPEND MORE MONEY ADVERTISING ON TV THAN THEY DO ON RESEARCH. WE WILL TAKE THEM ON. I DON'T WANT TO START OVER. THAT IS THE DISAGREEMENT I HAVE WITH SENATOR SANDERS. I WANT US TO BUILD ON WHAT WE HAD AND MAKE IT BETTER, AND GO FROM 90% COVERAGE TO 100% OF AMERICANS. I DON'T WANT TO START AT ZERO.   AND HAVE TO FIGHT IT ALL OVER AGAIN, HAVE THE NATIONAL BATTLE WE HAVE HAD OVER 25 YEARS. I AM DETERMINED WE WILL MAKE THIS WORK FOR EVERYBODY. I KNOW IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. I HOPE WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET YOUR COSTS DOWN, YOUR CO-PAYS, YOUR DEDUCTIBLES. WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TELLING YOU ARE STARTING TO PITCH AGAIN. I WILL DEFEND SOCIAL SECURITY AGAINST PRIVATIZATION. REPUBLICANS STILL WANT TO PRIVATIZE IT. THEY ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT THAT. IT IS A TERRIBLE IDEA. YOU KNOW THE WORST PART OF THE IDEA? THEY WANT TO TURN THE ENTIRE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND OVER TO WALL STREET. THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. TAKE ALL THAT MONEY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PAYING IN FOR 75 OR 80 YEARS AND TURN IT OVER TO WALL STREET. I WILL NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN.   THAT IS THE WORST IDEA IMAGINABLE. I WILL ALSO NOT LET THEM OUT TO RISE -- VOUCHERIZE MEDICARE OR PRIVATIZE THE V.A. WE WILL NOT TAKE AWAY GUARANTEED BENEFITS FOR VETERANS WHO HAVE EARNED THEM THROUGH THEIR SERVICE. THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AT SUMMATION POINT -- THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!   WHEN IT COMES TO NATIONAL SECURITY, WE HAVE A LOT TO DO TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE AND I HAVE SOME IDEAS I HAVE BEEN PUTTING OUT BASED ON WHAT I DID IN THE SENATE AFTER 9/11, BASED ON MY WORK AS SECRETARY OF STATE. IT IS IMPERATIVE WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO DEFEAT ISIS, TO STOP THE FLOW OF FOREIGN FIGHTERS AND FUNDING TO FIGHT THEM ON THE INTERNET WHERE THEY ARE QUITE EFFECTIVE, WITHOUT PUTTING AMERICAN TROOPS BACK ON THE GROUND IN EITHER SYRIA OR IRAQ.   THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN. IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ON MY WATCH. THEN WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB WORKING WITH FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO KEEP US SAFE AT HOME. WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB SHARING INTELLIGENCE, GETTING INTELLIGENCE THAT WILL HELP US PREVENT ATTACKS. WHEN I WAS A SENATOR AFTER 9/11, I WOULD BE KEPT UP-TO-DATE ON ALL THE THREATS THAT STILL WERE FACING NEW YORK. WE HAD A VERY DEDICATED GROUP OF POLICE AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EVERYONE WHO WORKED TOGETHER. BUT ONE OF THE BEST THINGS WE DID WAS A CAMPAIGN WHAT SAID IF YOU SEE SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS OR HEAR SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS, REPORT IT. PEOPLE WERE PICKING UP THE PHONE AND TELLING THE POLICE OR MAYBE CALLING THE F.B.I., AND IT REALLY PROVIDED KIND OF THE EYES-ON HELP WE NEEDED. PEOPLE COULD THEN FOLLOW-UP. WE PREVENTED ATTACKS. THE REASON I MENTION THAT IS BECAUSE OF THIS. THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES, LED BY THE FRONT RUNNER, HAVE BEEN ATTACKING MUSLIMS, RIGHT? YOU HAVE HEARD THAT, ATTACKING AMERICAN MUSLIMS, ATTACKING MUSLIMS AROUND THE WORLD. THAT IS NOT ONLY SHAMEFUL, IT IS DANGEROUS. WE NEED EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY TO BE ON THE SAME TEAM WHEN IT COMES TO PREVENTING TERRORIST ATTACKS.   AND WE NEED PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO HEAR SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING, TO REPORT IT AND NOT FEEL THEY ARE BEING DEMONIZED, DEFAMED, INSULTED, PUSHED OUT. CERTAINLY IF WE ARE GOING TO DEFEAT ISIS, WE NEED A COALITION THAT WILL INCLUDE MUSLIM NATIONS. I BUILT A COALITION IMPOSED SANCTIONS ON IRAN. I KNOW LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOU DO THIS. YOU DON'T START BY INSULTING PEOPLE'S RELIGION AND THEN ASKED THEM TO BE PART OF YOUR EFFORT TO DEFEAT A COMMON ADVERSARY.   THAT IS NOT THE WAY IT WORKS IN THE REAL WORLD. SO WE HAVE TO BE SMART ABOUT HOW WE PROTECT OURSELVES. AND THAT WILL BE MY HIGHEST PRIORITY. I ALSO WANT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARD COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM, WHICH I THINK IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR COUNTRY AND OUR ECONOMY.   AND I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW WHERE I STAND ON A LOT OF ISSUES THE REPUBLICANS HAVE TAKEN POSITIONS ON, BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO BE AGAINST SO MANY OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS I SUPPORT. I AM FOR A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN HEALTH DECISIONS, AND I AM AGAINST DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD.   I AM FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY, AND AGAINST HIS COMBINATION AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY. I AM AGAINST CITIZENS FLOODS OF UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY FROM THE KOCH BROTHERS AND OTHERS. I WOULD DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO REVERSE THAT DECISION. I ALSO WANT TO KEEP PUSHING FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND REFORM IN THE INCARCERATION SYSTEM. AND I WANT TO FIGHT FOR COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY MEASURES THAT WILL HELP KEEP AMERICANS SAFE WITHOUT INFRINGING ON GUN OWNERS' RIGHTS.   WE ARE A SMART PEOPLE. WE CAN DO THIS. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS HOW WHEN WE KNOW WE HAVE ON AVERAGE 90 PEOPLE A DAY DYING FROM GUN VIOLENCE, 33,000 PEOPLE A YEAR, WE CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROTECT PEOPLE, PROTECT FIRST-GRADERS GOING TO SCHOOL, PEOPLE GOING TO A MOVIE THEATER, CHURCHGOERS GOING TO BIBLE STUDY. WE CAN DO THIS. WE CAN'T STOP EVERY MURDER WERE EVERY SUICIDE OR EVERY TRAGIC, AVOIDABLE ACCIDENT. BUT WE CAN STOP A LOT OF THEM WITHOUT INFRINGING ON ANYBODY'S RIGHTS. 92% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGREE WITH THAT. AND 85% OF GUN OWNERS AGREE WITH THAT. SO WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO WILL STAND UP TO THE GUN LOBBYISTS AND STOP THEM FROM INTIMIDATING COMMONSENSE REFORMS IN OUR COUNTRY.   WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO, MY FRIENDS. AND YOU HAVE BEEN REALLY PATIENT. THE CHILDREN WHO ARE STILL HERE HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY PATIENT. I DON'T WANT TO KEEP YOU ANY LONGER. I JUST WANT TO SAY A FEW CLOSING COMMENTS. AND THEN FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT TO STAY, I WILL SHAKE YOUR HANDS AND TAKE PICTURES AND YOU CAN ASK ME QUESTIONS. BUT EVERYBODY ELSE CAN GO HOME AND NOT FEEL BAD ABOUT IT BECAUSE I NEED YOU TO GET UP TOMORROW AND HELP WORK TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO GO TO THE CAUCUS NEXT MONDAY!   I AM ALL ABOUT MAKING PROGRESS AGAINST THE ODDS. I AM ALL ABOUT WORKING WITH PEOPLE. I HAVE WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS AS FIRST LADY, AS SENATOR, AS SECRETARY OF STATE. I WORKED TO GET RESULTS FOR THE PEOPLE I REPRESENTED IN THE SENATE AS WELL AS OUR COUNTRY. I WORKED WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF STATE TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SAFE AND HAVE OUR VALUES AND INTERESTS PROMOTED. AND I KNOW HOW TO FIND COMMON GROUND BECAUSE I HAVE DONE IT. I THINK I DO BELIEVE PROBABLY EVERY REPUBLICAN I SERVED WITH AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER SPONSORED A PIECE OF MY LEGISLATION. ACTUALLY WHEN I'M NOT RUNNING FOR SOMETHING, THEY SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT ME.   EVEN IN THE CASE OF MR. TRUMP, THEY GIVE ME MONEY BECAUSE THEY THINK I AM SO GOOD AS A CANDIDATE AND SENATOR. THIS IS POLITICS. THIS IS ALL THAT THE GOES ON. ONCE THE ELECTION IS OVER, I WILL WORK AS HARD AS I CAN TO FIND THAT COMMON GROUND, TO GET GOOD THINGS TO HAPPEN FOR YOU, FOR YOUR FAMILIES, FOR YOUR COUNTRY. AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO FEEL LIKE I FELT, THAT REALLY THE AMERICAN DREAM WAS AVAILABLE. YOU HAD TO WORK FOR IT. BUT IF YOU DID, YOU COULD GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. THAT IS WHAT I THINK ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER. I AM THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FACTORY WORKER. SHE IS THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FORMER PRESIDENT. I THINK IT SHOULD NOT BANNER -- IT SHOULD NOT MATTER. THE GRANDCHILDREN OF EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR COUNTRY.   AND THAT IS WHAT I AM GOING TO STAND UP FOR AN FIGHT FOR. WITH YOUR HELP, STARTING AT THE CAUCUS NEXT MONDAY NIGHT, THAT IS WHAT WE WILL DO TOGETHER! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!      HERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO. THANK YOU. I NEED YOUR HELP NEXT MONDAY NIGHT. THANK YOU. I KNOW YOU DID. HAVE SOMEBODY PICK YOU UP AND TAKE YOU NEXT MONDAY. OH, GOOD. HELLO, HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU. CAUCUS FOR ME MONDAY NIGHT. THANK YOU. WANT TO GET A PICTURE? WANT ME IN IT?   THE THREE OF US WILL BE IN IT. OK? THANK YOU. OF COURSE I WILL. >>   HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU. GLAD YOU ARE HERE. THANK YOU. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE WITH YOU. THANK YOU.   HERE WE GO. I AM GLAD TO BE HERE. HERE WE GO. READY?  THANK YOU. CAUCUS MONDAY. >>     OF COURSE. TURN RIGHT AROUND HERE.  WITH BOTH OF YOU, OK?   I LOVE IT. OF COURSE YOU CAN.    HERE WE GO. YOU ARE WELCOME. SURE. GREAT.  GETTING CLOSE, NEXT MONDAY.  I LOVE IT.  WRIGLEY FIELD. I LOVE IT. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THE FAMILY?   THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  THANK YOU.  A -- NEXT MONDAY. THERE YOU GO.  THANK YOU. HOW ARE YOU DOING? SO HAPPY I GOT HERE. WANT TO GET A PICTURE? WHERE IS YOUR CAMERA?   HOW ARE YOU? YOU REMEMBER. THANK YOU. WITH YOUR HELP, I AM. I AM SO GLAD TO SEE YOU GUYS. THANK YOU. ARE YOU TOGETHER? HI, HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU.    GOT IT?     HI.       RIGHT NOW WE ARE SEEING REIMBURSEMENT RATES --   I KNOW. AND  PRESCRIPTION DRUG COMPANIES, INSURANCE COMPANIES. THE RECIPIENT'S PRICE IS GOING UP.   I HAVE TALKED TO A LOT OF FOLKS.   HIGH, HOW ARE YOU DOING -- HI, HOW ARE YOU DOING? I THINK BROADBAND IS PART OF  LIVING WITH ELECTRICITY STARTING IN THE 1930'S. IT TOOK ABOUT 30 YEARS, BUT WE GOT IT DONE. WE SHOULD HAVE A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM THAT SUBSIDIZES THE COST UNTIL WE GET IT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

WELL, I SURE AM. I'M READY WITH YOUR HELP AND I  AM SO HONORED TO ACCEPT THIS ENDORSEMENT OF THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD ACTION FUND, AND -- AND AS CECILE JUST SAID, I HAVE STOOD WITH YOU THROUGHOUT MY LIFE AND CERTAINLY THROUGHOUT MY  CAREER, AND I PROMISE YOU THIS. AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL ALWAYS  HAVE YOUR BACK. WE WILL WORK AND FIGHT TOGETHER. THIS HAS BEEN A PRETTY ENERGETIC  AND EVEN AN EMOTIONAL AFTERNOON,  BECAUSE YOU HAVE HEARD SO MANY GREAT ADVOCATES, SO MANY PEOPLE  ON THE FRONT LINES, FIGHTING TO PRESERVE WOMEN'S RIGHTS. I WANT TO THANK SOME OF THEM. I WANT TO THANK THE GREAT MC, I WANT TO THANK DONNA BURKET, I  WANT TO THANK NATASHA FROM BROOKLYN FOR HER STORY. SHE IS A PATIENT ADVOCATE WHO HAS BEEN A PATIENT.  I WANT TO THANK THE STUDENT ADVOCATE FROM LAS VEGAS. I WANT TO THANK CRYSTAL FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE WHO IS ALSO A PATIENT AND A VOLUNTEER BOTH FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND MY CAMPAIGN, AND  I APPRECIATE BOTH. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO ARE HERE -- ANN KUSTER, NIKI TSONGAS, CAROL SHEA-PORTER, FORMER AND FUTURE MEMBER OF CONGRESS FROM RIGHT HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE  ASSOCIATED WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD, FROM THE BOARD TO  THE STAFF, TO THE SUPPORTERS ONE  AND ALL, AND I PARTICULARLY WANT TO THANK YOUR FEARLESS LEADER  CECILE RICHARDS.  THERE'S A LOT ABOUT CECILE I  REALLY ADMIRE, AND AMONG THE LONG LIST, WHEN REPUBLICANS DEMANDED THAT SHE TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESS, A NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE GETTING THEMSELVES INTO -- THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE GETTING THEMSELVES INTO.  I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS. IT'S ONE OF MY EXPERIENCES WITH CECILE, BECAUSE FOR FIVE HOURS REPUBLICANS BELIEVED AND BLUSTER. CECILE NEVER FLINCHED. SHE JUST TOLD THEM THE FACTS, AND YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THE  REPUBLICANS ARE FACT ADVERSE.   THEY DID NOT WANT TO HEAR ANY OF THAT. THEY DO SEEM TO LIVE IN AN EVIDENCE FREE ZONE. JUST LIKE THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT, AND WHEN IT WAS OVER, I SAW AN INTERVIEW WHERE SOMEONE ASKED  CECILE, HOW DID YOU DO IT? HOW DID YOU STAY SO POISED IN THE FACE OF SUCH BREATHTAKING CONTEMPT FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH, WOMEN'S RIGHTS, WOMEN'S DIGNITY? DO YOU KNOW WHAT HER ANSWER WAS? SHE SAYS, WHEN YOU ARE STANDING UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT, YOU KEEP GOING. AND THAT'S WHAT --   THAT IS WHAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD  HAS DONE FOR NEARLY 100 YEARS.  IT IS CERTAINLY WHAT CECILE RICHARDS HAS DONE. SHE COMES BY THAT GRIT AND DETERMINATION FROM HER WONDERFUL  MOTHER, WHO I WAS PRIVILEGED TO  KNOW, AND I WISH ANN RICHARDS  COULD BE HERE WITH US FOR THIS ELECTION. WITH NEW LOVE TO HEAR HER GIVE --    DONALD TRUMP AND TED CRUZ AND THE OTHERS A PIECE OF HER MIND? OH, BOY, SO WHAT I.   YOU KNOW, EVERY ELECTION IS IMPORTANT, BUT  THIS ONE POSES SUCH A STARK CHOICE, AND MISTAKES ARE SO HIGH . IN JANUARY OF 2017, A NEW  PRESIDENT WILL WALK INTO THE  OVAL OFFICE. AMERICA CANNOT AFFORD FOR IT TO BE A REPUBLICAN WHO WILL RIP AWAY ALL OF THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE. YOU HEAR THEM, YOU HEAR WHAT THEY ARE SAYING, AS THE CELLIST FOR POSITION. THE SAME TOP-DOWN POLICIES THAT FAILED AND LED TO THE GREAT RECESSION. THEY DON'T EVEN SEEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE LIVES OF AMERICANS. WHETHER IT IS ECONOMIC POLICY OR HEALTH CARE POLICY OR FOREIGN POLICY, THEY ARE SO OUT OF TOUCH AND OUT OF DATE. THIS YEAR, THEY SUCCEEDED IN PASSING A BILL TO REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD, AND THE ONLY THING, AS CECILE SAID, STOPPING THEM FROM MAKING THAT THE LAW OF THE LAND WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S VETO PEN.  AND EVERY ONE OF THEM HAD PROMISED TO SIGN SUCH A BILL, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN. WHEN PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS THREATENED, THE HEALTH OF WOMEN AND A LOT OF MEN, TOO, ALL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY IS THREATENED , JUST LIKE HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WHEN THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL VOTED TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD. WITHOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT 19 MILLION AMERICANS WOULD LOSE THEIR HEALTH COVERAGE. INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULD BE  BACK IN CHARGE. THEY WOULD BE FREE TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, FREE TO GO BACK TO CHARGING WOMEN MORE  FOR OUR HEALTH CARE THAN MEN. SO, CLEARLY WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. AND THEREFORE WE NEED A DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO BEAT THE REPUBLICANS AND GET THE JOB DONE FOR AMERICANS. I SHUDDER TO THINK ABOUT WHAT  THE REPUBLICANS WOULD DO IF  GIVEN THE CHANCE. WE KNOW ANY REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WOULD ACCELERATE THE ASSAULT ON ACCESS TO SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION. AND THINK ABOUT THIS. THE NEXT PRESIDENT COULD EASILY APPOINT MORE THAN ONE JUSTICE TO BE SUPREME COURT'S. ALREADY THE COURT IS GETTING READY TO CONSIDER A TEXAS LAW THAT IMPOSES BURDENSOME AND MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY  REQUIREMENTS ON ABORTION  PROVIDERS. IF THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE ALLOWED TO STAND, 5.4 MILLION WOMEN WILL BE LEFT WITH JUST 10 HEALTH CENTERS ACROSS THAT HUGE EXPANSE OF TEXAS THAT PROVIDE  NECESSARY SERVICES AND THE EFFECTS OF THAT DECISION WOULD  RIPPLE OUT ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. IT IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE TO  ROE V WADE IN A GENERATION. THE COURT WILL ALSO REVIEW ANOTHER CHALLENGE TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BIRTH-CONTROL PROVISION. REMEMBER THE HOBBY LOBBY DECISION THAT MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR A WOMAN'S EMPLOYER TO LIMIT HER HEALTH CARE CHOICES? THAT FIGHT IS NOT OVER EITHER. ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE BIRTH  CONTROL IS STILL HANGING IN THE BALANCE AT THE SUPREME COURT. IF A REPUBLICAN WINS THIS ELECTION AND GETS THE CHANCE TO  STACK THE SUPREME COURT WITH RIGHT-WING JUSTICES, TOGETHER, THEY WILL ACCELERATE THE MOVE TO TAKE AMERICA AND THE WRONG DIRECTION, AND SO MANY ISSUES YOU AND I HAVE FOUGHT FOR AND MANY AMERICANS NOW TAKE ARE GRANTED, THEY WANT TO STRIP AWAY  WORKERS RIGHTS AND MAKE IT HARDER TO ORGANIZE. THEY WANT TO TURN BACK THE CLOCK ON VOTING RIGHTS AND LGBT RIGHT. THEY WANT TO FURTHER GOT  CAMPAIGN -- FURTHER GUT CAMPAIGN-FINANCE REFORM. A REPUBLICAN WILL NOT DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN FINALLY GET EQUAL PAY FOR THE WORK WE DO. THEY ALL WANT TO CUT TAXES  FURTHER FOR THE SUPER RICH AND  GET OUT OF THE WAY OF CORPORATIONS.  2014 WAS THE SECOND HOTTEST YEAR ON RECORD, BUT SOME REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE STILL DENY THAT CLIMATE CHANGE EVEN EXISTS. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY. WELL, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST.   THERE IS AN EASY ANSWER TO THAT. GO TALK TO A SCIENTIST. AND YOU KNOW --   IN FACT, ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES, I DO NOT KNOW WHO THEY'S AND  THEIR TIME TALKING TO OR LISTENING TO.  HONEST TO GOODNESS, THEY DO NOT AGREE WITH ANYTHING I'M ADVOCATING FOR, RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE, COMBATING CLIMATE  CHANGE, RAISING INCOMES FOR WORKING AMERICANS. I SEE THEM TALKING TO PEOPLE. I HAVE CONCLUDED THEY HAVE A GROUP OF ACTORS THAT MOVE FROM  PLACE TO PLACE. NO ONE STANDS UP AND SAYS WHAT I HEAR FROM THE THOUSANDS OF  PEOPLE I LISTEN TO. SO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT FROM ME THOUGH. THEY ARE SAYING IT ALL THEMSELVES. THEY ARE TELLING YOU EXACTLY WHAT THEY WILL DO IF THEY GET ELECTED.  AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WE SHOULD BELIEVE THEM. WE SHOULD BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE SO FAR OUT IN SAYING  WHAT THEY WILL DO, THEY WILL BE HELD TO IT, AND SOME OF THEM EVEN BELIEVE IT. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE STAND, AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHERE I STAND. FIRST OF ALL, I WILL ALWAYS DEFEND PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND --   AND I WILL SAY CONSISTENTLY AND PROUDLY, PLANNED PARENTHOOD SHOULD BE FUNDED, SUPPORTED, AND APPRECIATED, NOT UNDERMINED, MISREPRESENTED, AND DEMONIZED. I BELIEVE -- I BELIEVE WE NEED TO PROTECT ACCESS TO SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION, NOT JUST IN PRINCIPLE, BUT IN PRACTICE. ANY RIGHT THAT REQUIRES YOU TO TAKE EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES TO ACCESS IT IS NO RIGHT AT ALL. NOT WHEN PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS HAVE TO ENDURE HARASSMENT AND INTIMIDATION JUST TO WALK INTO A HEALTH CENTER. NOT WHEN --   NOT WHEN MAKING AN APPOINTMENT MEANS TAKING TIME OFF FROM WORK, FINDING CHILDCARE, AND DRIVING HALFWAY ACROSS YOUR STATE, NOT WHEN PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED BY STATE LAW TO RECITE MISLEADING INFORMATION TO WOMEN IN ORDER TO SHAME AND SCARE THEM, AND NOT AS LONG AS WE HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS LIKE THE HYDE AMENDMENT, MAKING IT HARDER FOR LOW INCOME WOMEN TO EXERCISE THEIR FULL RIGHTS. NOW -- WHEN I TALK LIKE THIS, AND I DO  OFTEN --    SECRETARY CLINTON: REPUBLICAN SAY I AM PLAYING THE GENDER CARD. WELL, IF FIGHTING FOR EACH PAY, PAID LEAVE, AND PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS PLAYING THE GENDER CARD, DEAL ME IN.  I WANT YOU TO ALSO KNOW, I WILL ALWAYS STAND UP FOR ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE CONTRACEPTION WITHOUT  INTERFERENCE FROM POLITICIANS  ARE LAWYERS. BIRTH-CONTROL IS BASIC HEALTH CARE, AND IT PLAYS A VITAL ROLE  IN THE HEALTH OF MILLIONS OF WOMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES. I WAGED A FIGHT WITH MY GOOD FRIEND, SENATOR PATTY MURRAY  FROM WASHINGTON, WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE TO MAKE SURE  EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION COULD BE OVER-THE-COUNTER. AND WE -- WE WAGE THAT BATTLED FOR YEARS. WE HELD UP A BUSH APPOINTEE THAT THE FDA -- TO THE FDA, AND WE FINALLY ONE. I PROMISE YOU I WILL NEVER GIVE UP AND I WILL NEVER BACK OFF. AND I WILL SUPPORT COMPREHENSIVE , INCLUSIVE SEX EDUCATION.  FOR GOODNESS SAKES, PEOPLE DESERVE ACCURATE INFORMATION. I THOUGHT WE WERE IN OPEN SOCIETY. -- I THOUGHT WE WERE AN OPEN SOCIETY.  WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT IS TRUE ACROSS THE BOARD. I WILL DEFEND AND IMPROVE THE  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AS FIRST LADY, I FOUGHT TO GIVE EVERY AMERICAN ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE, QUALITY HEALTH CARE, AND I STILL HAVE THE SCARS TO PROVE IT. AND WHEN THE DRUG COMPANIES AND INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THEIR ALLIES BLOCKED OUR WAY. I WAS DISAPPOINTED, BUT NOT DISCOURAGED. I WENT BACK TO WORK WITH LEADERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TO  CREATE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH  INSURANCE PROGRAM AND TWO DECADES LATER, I WAS SO PROUD TO BE PART OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S ADMINISTRATION WHEN HE SIGNED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT INTO LAW . AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL DO MORE TO BRING DOWN COSTS FOR  FAMILIES AND EASE ORDINANCE ON  SMALL BUSINESSES AND MAKE SURE CONSUMERS HAPPY CHOICES YOU DESERVE. NO ONE IN AMERICA SHOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GETTING HEALTH CARE AND PAYING THE RENT. WE CAN FIX THIS.  BUT ONLY IF WE ELECT A PRESIDENT WHO HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THE JOB DONE FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES. TO TAKE ON ISSUES AS BIG AS THE  WORLD AND A SMALL AS YOUR KITCHEN TABLE. I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR WOMEN AND FAMILIES MY ENTIRE LIFE. I WILL GO ANYWHERE, ANYTIME, TO MEET WITH ANYONE, AND WORK MY HEART OUT TO FIND COMMON GROUND, BUT I WILL STAND MY GROUND. I'M NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE RIP AWAY THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE. THAT IS WHY HEDGE FUND  BILLIONAIRES ARE RUNNING ADS AGAINST ME. THAT IS WHY THE KOCH BROTHERS ARE PLEDGING TO SPEND WHATEVER IT TAKES TO STOP ME. THEY KNOW THAT I WILL DEFEAT THEIR RIGHT-WING, TOP-DOWN  AGENDA THAT IS SO BAD FOR AMERICA.  NOW DONALD TRUMP AND TED CRUZ  AND THEIR POWERFUL FRIENDS MAY BE TRYING TO DRAG US BACK TO THE  STONE AGE, BUT WE HAVE OUR SITES SET ON THE FUTURE. BECAUSE IN SPITE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE, I BELIEVE OUR BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US. THERE IS SO MUCH WE CAN DO TOGETHER. JUST LOOK AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD, EVERY SINGLE DAY AT HEALTH CENTERS ACROSS AMERICA. PEOPLE ARE DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS TOGETHER. SOMETIMES UNDER ENORMOUS STRESS AND PRESSURE. WHEN A MAN WHO NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO HAVE A GUN IN THE FIRST PLACE KILLED THREE PEOPLE AT THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN COLORADO SPRINGS, THE COMMUNITY CAME TOGETHER TO MOURN . THE VERY NEXT DAY, PLANNED PARENTHOOD STAFF GOT UP AND WENT  TO WORK IN COLORADO AND ACROSS  THE COUNTRY, PROVIDING BIRTH CONTROL, STD TESTING, CANCER SCREENINGS, AND YES, ABORTION IS. EVERY TIME A PATIENT CALLS TO ASK IF THEY CAN STILL COME IN  FOR THEIR APPOINTMENT, THERE WAS  ONLY ONE RESPONSE. AT THESE  STORES STAY OPEN. THOSE FOUR WORDS --   THOSE FOUR WORDS SUM UP EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT LAND PARENTHOOD, DON'T THEY? WHEN YOU ARE STANDING UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT, YOU KEEP GOING. I WAS RAISED BY A MOTHER WHO HAD A DIFFICULT CHILDHOOD. SHE WAS ABANDONED, MISTREATED, OUT ON HER OWN AS A HOUSEMAID BY  THE TIME SHE WAS 14. BUT SHE NEVER STOPPED BELIEVING THE FUTURE COULD BE BETTER. SHE NEVER STOPPED BEING GRATEFUL FOR THE SECOND, THIRD, AND FOURTH CHANCES PEOPLE GAVE HER IN OUR COUNTRY.  AND NOW I HAVE THIS AMAZING 15 --MONTH-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER AND I THINK ABOUT HER EVERY DAY. AND OF COURSE I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE SURE SHE HAS EVERY OPPORTUNITY IN LIFE. BUT HERE IS WHAT I HAVE CONCLUDED NOW THAT I AM A MEMBER OF THE GRAND PARENT CLUB.   THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.  IT REALLY MATTERS WHAT KIND OF  COUNTRY SHE GROWS UP IN AND WHAT KIND OF WORLD IS WAITING FOR HER. IT MATTERS NOT JUST THAT MY GRANDCHILD CAN REALIZE THE PROMISE OF AMERICA, BUT THAT EVERY CHILD AND GRANDCHILD HAS THE SAME OPPORTUNITY. TOGETHER --   TOGETHER WE CAN HAVE THE AMERICA THAT WE ALL BELIEVE IS POSSIBLE. AND I NEED YOUR HELP TO DO THAT. I NEED YOUR HELP STARTING HERE IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY AND IOWA CAUCUS. WE NEED A FUTURE WHERE A FATHER  CAN TELL HIS DAUGHTER, YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO BE, INCLUDING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.         THERE YOU GO. YOU ARE WELCOME.  THERE YOU GO.  CAN WE GET ALL OF US IN? >> ALL RIGHT. 1, 2.  THANKS, YOU GUYS. THANK YOU.  OH, GREAT. >>   EXACTLY.  HI, HOW ARE YOU?   I THINK I AM.  I THINK I AM.  WE WILL LET YOU KNOW.  TAKE MINE,  THERE YOU GO. GET EVERYBODY IN. GOT IT?  HI HOW ARE  YOU? -- HI, HOW ARE YOU? HERE WE GO. HOW ARE YOU?  HOW ARE YOU?  EVERY WEEK. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT.  I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT YOU. OH.

I GUESS THE REPUBLICANS WILL BE NEXT?   IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.  THANK YOU. SHE IS WONDERFUL.   NO, AND I HAVE COME OUT AGAINST THE RAIDS. I DON'T THINK IT IS AN APPROPRIATE TOOL TO ENFORCE THE IMMIGRATION LAWS. I THINK THEY ARE DIVISIVE, S TARTING DISCORD AND FEAR. I ALSO CAME OUT IN FAVOR OF GUARANTEEING UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN HAVE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED COUNCIL SO AS THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS, THEY WILL NOT BE CONFUSED BY THE PROCESS AND WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO TELL THEIR STORY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO PUT THIS IN THE BROADER CONTEXT WHICH IS WHAT I HAVE TRIED TO DO. WE HAVE TO HAVE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM, BUT HOW WE IMPLEMENT OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS DOES HAVE SOME ABILITY FOR THE EXECUTIVE TO MAKE CHOICES. I WOULD PRIORITIZE CRIMINALS, PEOPLE WHO ARE PLOTTING OR TAKING ACTION THAT IS AGAINST OUR PUBLIC SAFETY OR OUR PROPERTY. THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE ON MY LIST.  I CAN PROMISE THAT IT WILL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE DUE PROCESS. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE IMMIGRATION ASYLUM AND REFUGEE LAWS. RIGHT NOW UNTIL WE DO, WE HAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HANDLE THIS VERY LARGE GROUP OF PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO ARE COMING NORTH. WE HAVE TO BE SENSITIVE AND HUMANE IN THE APPLICATION OF OUR LAWS. WE ALSO HAVE TO DO A LOT MORE. THIS IS WHERE I THINK I HAVE A PARTICULAR PASSION. WE HAVE TO DO A LOT MORE TO HELP THOSE COUNTRIES IN CENTRAL AMERICA GET OVER SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF VIOLENCE, CRIMINALITY, DRUG CARTELS. THAT IS REALLY THE IMPETUS BEHIND IT. YOU KNOW THAT THIS YEAR WE HAD NO NET IMMIGRATION FROM MEXICO. IN FACT, MEXICANS IN AMERICA ARE ACTUALLY GOING BACK TO MEXICO. WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE THERE IS, DESPITE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE KNOW EXIST, THERE IS BETTER ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. THERE IS BETTER STABILITY FOR FAMILIES. IN SIMILARLY, I REMEMBER THE GOOD HEALTH AMERICANS GAVE TO THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE TO OVERCOME THEIR DECADES OF CIVIL WAR AND APPARATUS BEHAVIOR OF THE -- KAREN THIS -- KARENHORRENDOUS BEHAVIOR OF THE DRUG CARTELS.  I WOULD GIVE EVERY PERSON, PARTICULARLY CHILDREN, DUE PROCESS FORTO HAVE THEIR STORY TO BE TOLD. EVERY CHILDREN WILL HAVE LEGITIMATE STORIES UNDER OUR LAWS TO BE ABLE TO STAY. I WILL END PUBLIC TO DETENTION CENTERS WHICH DO NOT UPHOLD THE VALUES OF AMERICANS. I CANNOT SIT HERE AND SAY WE WILL HAVE A BLANKET RULE OF WHO OR WHO WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE STAYING IN THE COUNTRY. WHAT I DON'T LIKE IS A MASS ROUND UP AND A RAID SENDING PEOPLE OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. THAT SHOULD END.  I HAVE DONE A LOT OF THINKING ABOUT THAT. I HAVE MET WITH A VERY DYNAMIC GROUP OF YOUNG BLACK LIVES MATTER ACTIVISTS. I HAVE HEARD DIRECTLY FROM THEM. IT IS A BROAD AGENDA WE HAVE TO AGENDA. LET'S START WITH THE MOST CONTENTIOUS ISSUES. POLICING REFORM, INCARCERATION REFORM. I BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT THIS HAS TO BE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OF THE PRESIDENT. PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RELEASING COMMISSION HAS SOME VERY GOOD SUGGESTIONS I WOULD WANT TO BUILD ON WHAT WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE IN REACHING OUT AND LISTENING DIRECTLY TO COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING AFFECTED. WHOSE FAMILIES ARE DECIMATED BY THE LARGE NUMBERS OF MISSING MEN IN THE COMMUNITY. I HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT WHAT I WOULD DO WHEN IT COMES TO ARRESTS. WE HAVE TO HAVE A CLEAR SET OF STANDARDS BECAUSE AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN AND LATINO MEN IN PARTICULAR GET ARRESTED MORE QUICKLY FOR DOING THE SAME THING AS A WHITE MAN DOES. IT CONTINUES THROUGH THE PROCESS. MORE THAN LIKELY TO BE CHARGED, MORE LIKELY TO BE CONVICTED, MORE LIKELY TO BE INCARCERATED. THE FIGURES DO NOT LIE. WE HAVE TO BRING THAT TO A BROADER AUDIENCE BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A VIOLATION OF WHAT WE SAY OUR VALUES ARE. WE HAVE SYSTEMIC RACISM AND BIAS THAT IS IMPLICIT IN THE SYSTEM. UNLESS WE BEGIN TO GO AFTER THAT AND END IT, WE DON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM. IN ADDITION TO THE REALLY DIFFICULT PIECES OF REFORM NEEDED IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND INCARCERATION, WE HAVE TO DISRUPT THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. WE NEED A CRADLE TO COLLEGE PIPELINE. WE NEED MORE JOB OPPORTUNITIES. I WANT TO INCENTIVIZE MORE INVESTMENT IN THE MOST DISTANT THISINVESTED COMMUNITIES. INNER CITIES, POOR RURAL AREAS, NATIVE AMERICAN RESERVATIONS. WE HAVE PLACES WHERE THE POVERTY IS SO APPALLING. IT IS NOT WHAT WE SAY WE STAND FOR. IT IS NOT JUST DEALING WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUE BECAUSE I WANT TO END INCARCERATION OF PEOPLE FOR LOW LEVEL IN OFFENSES. WE NEED FAR MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO STAY OUT OF JAIL OR PRISON WHILE THEY DEAL WITH A DRUG PROBLEM OR A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM WHICH IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS PEOPLE END UP IN JAIL AND PRISON. WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, IT IS NOT ONLY WRONG AND DEHUMANIZING, IT DOESN'T MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE. IF YOU HAVE A SYSTEM -- WE SHOULD HAVE TREATMENT RECOVERY PROGRAMS ACROSS AMERICA SO THAT WHEN SOMEBODY IS IN AND OUT OF JAIL OR THE EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE ABOUT ALL OR ALCOHOL OR DRUGS, THEY GET A SETTING TO GO BESIDES JAIL. I HAVE SEEN A GREAT EXAMPLE IN RENO, NEVADA. WHAT I WANT IS TO MAKE THE CASE. IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, BUT IT IS ALSO CHEAPER. IT IS A HUMANITARIAN, MORAL THING TO DO. IT COSTS $3000 TO DIVERT SOMEBODY. IT COSTS $30,000 TO PUT SOMEBODY IN JAIL. YOU MAKE THE CHOICE.   YES. I HAVE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. IT IS HARD TO JUSTIFY BECAUSE IF WE HAVE A RIGHT, AND I THINK PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO HEALTH. WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE THAT REAL. CERTAINLY COME OF THE FULL RANGE OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH RIGHTS THAT WOMEN SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED ACCESS TO SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION. IF STATE GOVERNMENTS, IF POLITICIANS USE THEIR POWER TO TRY TO RESTRICT THAT RIGHT, WELL OFF PEOPLE WILL STILL HAVE IT. WE KNOW THAT. A LOT OF POORER WOMEN, ISOLATED FAR FROM A PLACE WITH A CAN GET SERVICES, ARE GOING TO BE DENIED. THAT IS WHY THIS CASE IS GOING TO THE SUPREME COURT OUT OF TEXAS. THE TEXAS GOVERNMENT HAS FORCED THE CLOSING OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINICS. A TOTALLY INACCURATE MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS. IT IS A HUGE STATE AND IT IS GOING TO BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR POORER WOMEN TO EXERCISE THAT RIGHT. I THINK WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO REPEAL THAT AMENDMENT. I THINK IT HAS BEEN A BLOCKADE.  I DON'T HAVE ANY OVERALL DATA OR INFORMATION TO RESPOND TO THAT. I DON'T WANT TO DRAW GENERALIZATIONS. I THINK IT IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO BE REMINDED OF SOME OF THE STRUGGLES THAT WENT BEFORE WHETHER IT IS CIVIL RIGHTS, HUMAN RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHTS, GAY RIGHTS OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE. I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE ACTIONS GOING ON IN STATES AND BECAUSE OF THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION, IT IS IN THE NEWS NOW. ANYBODY WHO MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THIS IS ANCIENT HISTORY IS REALIZING THAT MAYBE IT ISN'T. IT IS IMPORTANT TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO RAISE THE VISIBILITY OF THESE ISSUES AND DEMONSTRATE IMPORTANT CONNECTIONS THAT THEY HAVE WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES WHETHER OR NOT YOU EVER EXERCISE THAT RIGHT. IT IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE. I FEEL ESPECIALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I TRAVELED TO SO MANY COUNTRIES. I HAVE BEEN IN A HOSPITAL IN NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL WHERE THE DOCTORS TOLD ME HALF THE WOMEN ARE SO HAPPY THEY JUST HAD A BABY. HALF THE WOMEN ARE HERE BECAUSE OF BOTCHED ABORTIONS. I WENT TO ROMANIA WHERE THE PRIOR COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP ACTUALLY LEGALLY REQUIRED EVERYONE WOMAN TO HAVE FIVE CHILDREN. THE SECRET POLICE WOULD FOLLOW TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT TRYING TO DO ANYTHING, EVEN BIRTH CONTROL, TO PREVENT THAT. THOUSANDS OF ABANDONED BABIES, WORKING AGES ORPHANAGES FILLED WITH MANY KIDS. I SPOKE IN BEIJING IN 1995 AGAINST FORCED STERILIZATION. REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS ARE A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT. NO GOVERNMENT SHOULD INTERFERE. THEY SHOULD NOT TELL A WOMAN WHAT SHE CAN DO WITH HER LIFE AND BODY. WE NEED TO STAND UP AGAIN WITH THIS MOVEMENT THAT IS CURRENTLY GOING ON.   I THINK THAT WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF THREATS IN OUR COUNTRY. I WOULD NOT DISCOUNT ANY OF THEM. I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE THEM ALL SERIOUSLY. MANY OF THOSE THREATS ARE FUELED BY THE GUN VIOLENCE THAT WE FACE EVERY SINGLE DAY. WHERE 90 AMERICANS ARE KILLED BY GUNS, TRAGIC AVOIDABLE ACCIDENTS. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I'M SO ADAMANT AND IN SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S POLICIES IS I THINK AS A NATION WE CANNOT SIT IDLY BY WHILE 33,000 PEOPLE A YEAR DIE FROM GUN VIOLENCE. I ALSO BELIEVE WE HAVE TO TAKE ANY FORM OF VIOLENCE, PARTICULARLY ORGANIZED VIOLENCE, SERIOUSLY. YES, I BELIEVE THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF UNDERGROUND MOVEMENTS AND EFFORTS IN OUR COUNTRY TO TRY TO USE VIOLENCE OR CERTAIN BELIEFS THAT I FIND OFTEN LEAD TO VIOLENCE. LET'S TAKE SOME OF THE WHITE EXTREMISM WE SEE. I REMEMBER VERY WELL GO INTO OKLAHOMA CITY AND SEEING THE RUINS OF THE FEDERAL BUILDING WHERE I RECALL 168 AMERICANS AND 19 CHILDREN WERE MURDERED BY A BOMB BY A GUY WHO AIDED THE GOVERNMENT. THAT IS -- HATED THE GOVERNMENT. THAT IS TERRORISM. WHEN YOU HAVE COMMUNITIES TERRORIZED BY GANGS WHERE PARENTS ARE AFRAID TO SEND THEIR KIDS OUT. I REMEMBER A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN FROM CHICAGO. SHE PERFORMED AT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SECOND INAUGURATION. CAME HOME HANGING OUT WITH HER FRIENDS ACROSS SCHOOL FROM CHICAGO AND GETS MURDERED. STRAY BULLET, INTENTIONAL BULLET -- MURDERED. I THINK WHEN YOU HAVE POLICE VIOLENCE THAT TERRORIZES COMMUNITIES, THAT DOES NOT SHOW THE RESPECT THAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE FROM PROTECTING PEOPLE IN YOUR AUTHORITY, THAT CAN FEEL TERRORIZING. THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF POTENTIAL VIOLENT ACTS. WE HAVE TO GO AFTER ALL OF THEM. WE HAVE TO STOP THEM ALL. WE CANNOT LET ANYBODY LIVE IN FEAR. IT HAS BECOME HIGHER PROFILE WHEN IT IS TIED TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS COMING FROM THE OUTSIDE AND NOT HOMEGROWN. WELL, I SAW HOMEGROWN TERRORISM IN OKLAHOMA CITY AND I SAW FOREIGN TERRORISM IN NEW YORK CITY. I SAW PEOPLE GRIEVING OVER THE LOSS OF THEIR LOVED ONES. AT SOME POINT, WE ALL HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AS A COUNTRY AGAIN AND STAND AGAINST VIOLENCE AND DO SOMETHING TO GET THE GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM, NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE.   WHERE DO I START?  I THINK IT IS HARD WHEN YOU ARE SWIMMING IN THE OCEAN TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND YOU, SO MUCH AS IT IS WHEN YOU ARE STANDING ON THE SHORE WATCHING. FOR ME, I WAS BORN WHITE, MIDDLE-CLASS IN THE MIDDLE OF AMERICA. I WENT TO GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I HAD A VERY STRONG SUPPORTIVE FAMILY. I HAD A LOT OF GREAT EXPERIENCES GROWING UP. I WENT TO A WONDERFUL COLLEGE. I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL. I NEVER REALLY KNEW WHAT WAS OR WAS NOT PART OF THE PRIVILEGE. I JUST KNEW I WAS A LUCKY PERSON AND THAT BEING LUCKY WAS IN PART RELATED TO I AM, WHERE I'M FROM AND THE OPPORTUNITIES I HAD. BUT, I WILL TELL YOU WHEN I FIRST REALIZED THAT I WAS PRIVILEGED BOTH BECAUSE I WAS WHITE AND ECONOMICALLY STABLE. I HAD TWO EXPERIENCES THROUGH MY CHURCH. THE FIRST WAS WHEN I WAS ABOUT 11 YEARS OLD, A CHURCH ASKED IF SOME OF US WOULD VOLUNTEER TO BABYSIT FOR THE CHILDREN OF MIGRANT WORKERS ON SATURDAY BECAUSE THE FAMILY HAD TO GO INTO THE FIELDS AND THE OLDER KIDS HAD TO GO WITH THEM. THERE WAS NOBODY LEFT TO WATCH THE LITTLE KIDS. I AND A COUPLE OF MY FRIENDS VOLUNTEERED. IN THOSE DAYS, CHICAGO WAS SURROUNDED BY FIELDS. IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT ANYMORE. IT WAS ON THE MIGRANT JOURNEY FROM MEXICO OF TO TEXAS TO THE MIDWEST AND THEN TO MICHIGAN. A CERTAIN POINT IN THE SUMMER HARVEST, FOLKS WERE IN THE CHICAGO AREA. I REMEMBER GOING OUT THERE TAKING CARE OF THESE ADORABLE LITTLE KIDS. AND, I KIND OF THOUGHT THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM ME. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES, BUT THEY WERE JUST LITTLE KIDS. AT THE END OF THE DAY, AT THE END OF THIS LONG ROAD BECAUSE THEY'RE ARE ALL THESE HOUSING UNITS, THE BUS STOPS AND THE OLDER SIBLINGS GOT OUT. WHEN THE LITTLE KIDS SAW THEM, THEY DROP EVERYTHING AND BEGAN RUNNING FOR THEIR MOTHERS AND FATHERS, HOLDING THEIR ARMS OUT. I REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY WATCHING THAT AND I WAS THINKING I USED TO DO THAT WITH MY FATHER. AND, I'M WATCHING THESE KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES, THEY HAVE TO WORK SO HARD. THE PLACE THEY LIVE IS NOT VERY NICE. I JUST FELT I HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF LIFE. I DID NOT CALL IT A PARTICULAR NAME BUT IT WAS A DIFFERENT LIFE AND I KNEW THAT.  YES. THAT WAS A POOR CHOICE OF WORDS. OBVIOUSLY, HISTORICALLY -- UNDOCUMENTED. I WILL NOT USE IT IN THE FUTURE.  EVERYBODY I KNOW ON THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHO FAVORED FOR REFORM ALSO FAVORED BORDER SECURITY. THAT IS TED KENNEDY, MY HUSBAND, PRESIDENT OBAMA. EVEN SOMEBODY LIKE PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH WAS TRYING TO PUSH REFORM AND GAVE UP TOO EASILY. WE DO NEED TO HAVE SECURE BORDERS. WHAT THAT WILL TAKE IS A COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGY AND PHYSICAL BARRIERS.  I DO NOT IN ANY WAY UP THOSE THE PLAN. MY GOOD FRIEND JILL -- SENATOR GILLIBRAND INTRODUCED THE BILL AND ICE UP HER. THE SUBSTANCES BOTH WEEKS OF PAID LEAVE, SEVEN WEEKS OF PAID SIX DATE SICK LEAVE. I HAVE THE SAME PLAN TO PUT A FOUR BY CLOSING THE LOOPHOLES AND RAISING TAXES ON THE WEALTHY. I THINK MY PLAN IS A BETTER APPROACH TO GET TO THE SAME ABJECT OF AND I DO THINK WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH NUMEROUS PROBLEMS SIMULTANEOUSLY. UNTIL WE STABILIZE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MAKE SURE WILL BE THERE AND THE PROMISE WILL BE FULFILLED, I DO NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING TO THE PUERILE TAX.  THAT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE I HAVE MADE UP SPECIFICALLY MY TAX PLANNING AND MY FRIEND SENATOR SANDERS HAS SAID HE WILL LAY OUT HIS BEFORE THE IOWA CAUCUS AND MYSELF AND OTHERS WILL BE ANXIOUS TO SEE THEM. I HAVE SAID I HAVE CAP DEDUCTIONS AT MAY 8% WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS. CLOSING LOOPHOLES LIKE THOSE THE HEDGE FUND MANAGERS USED TO PAY A LOWER TAX RATE BAN MOST SECRETARIES DO. A TAX ON EVERYBODY MAKING $1 MILLION OR MORE IN A DAY FAIR'S -- FAIR CHAIR SURCHARGE -- A FAIR SHARE SURCHARGE OF INCOMES OVER $5 MILLION. THE REASON I DO NOT WANT TO RAISE MIDDLE-CLASS TAXES IS MOST MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES OF NOT RECOVERED FROM THE RECESSION. NOT RECOVERED FROM WAGES NOT OWING UP. OFTEN ARE WORKING TWO JOBS AND SET OF ONE. FAMILY WEALTH IS NOT RECOVERED. THEY MAY HAVE LOST A HOME AND ARE NOW RENTING. I HAVE A VERY CLEAR PLAN OUTLINED ABOUT WHERE MONEY WILL COME FROM TO PROVIDE PAID LEAVE WHICH IS A HIGH PRIORITY OF MINE.  I AM RUNNING FOR HIS NAME, NOT EVERY GRANDMOTHER DOES THAT.  NOTHING WILL STOP HE WAS BASICALLY A DEMOCRAT BEFORE HE WAS A REPUBLICAN. HE WAS SOMEBODY WE ALL KNEW IN NEW YORK. HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF THEM ACROSS. WITH SUPPORTIVE OF A LOT OF CAUSES I CARED ABOUT AND PEOPLE I KNEW CARED ABOUT AND NOW HE SEEMS TO TAKE IN ANOTHER ROAD.  LOOK, PEOPLE CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT ABOUT US. WE UNDERSTAND IT IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING POSITIVE TO SAY ABOUT WHAT YOU WILL DO TO HELP PEOPLE THRIVE, YOU ARE GOING TO RESORT TO PERSONAL ATTACKS. THAT IS NOT SOMETHING WE WILL IN DALTON OR TRY TO RESPOND, WE WILL JUST LET PEOPLE RUN THEIR CAMPAIGNS ANYWAY THEY WANT. I AM GOING TO RUN ON WHAT I THINK WILL HELP OUR COUNTRY AND I WILL LET OUR VOTERS DECIDE. >> TELL US THE TRUTH. DO YOU HATE --?  I DON'T TAKE THEM, BUT NUMBER ONE, I DON'T LIKE TO TAKE A SELFIE, I WANT TO TALK TO PEOPLE. NUMBER TWO, I ONCE HAD A SELFIE WITH CHLOE -- ONE OF THE KARDASHIAN'S. SHE HAD LIGHTING THAT YOU PUT ROGER CASE. -- THAT YOU PUT AROUND YOUR CASE. YOU CANNOT TAKE A BAD PICTURE WITH IT. BUT MOST SELFIES, NOW, WHEN PEOPLE ASK FOR A SELFIE, I WILL SAY OK AND TAKE IT. BUT HARDLY EVER ARE THEY AS GOOD AS KIM KARDASHIAN'S. BUT I FEEL KIND OF LIKE, HEY, WHAT IS THE POINT?  THERE ARE SO MANY. WHERE DO I START? OH, MY FAVORITE. I WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, ONE OF THE COWBOYS PUBLISH THIS AMAZING PICTURE WITH MY HEAD AND I WAS WEARING SOMETHING I ACTUALLY OWN. SOMETIMES I KNOW IT IS NOT MY BODY BECAUSE THEY PUT MY HEAD ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S CLOTHING, BUT THIS ONE WAS MY CLOTHING AND THERE WERE ARMS COMING AROUND AND THE HEADLINE WAS, HILLARY'S SECRET ALIEN BABY. AND THE ALIEN WAS RIGHT THERE, IT WAS REALLY CUTE. SORT OF E.T.-ISH.  I THINK WE SHOULD STUDY WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES MOVE FORWARD. I AM ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO THAT. THERE ARE SOME GOOD IDEAS. THERE IS AN IDEA IN THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS ABOUT TARGETING DOLLARS TO COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE DISINVESTMENT OR NO INVESTMENT AND HAVE HAD YEARS OF BEING BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL. THAT IS WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON.  ANYONE CAN WIN. RIVER THOUGHT DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE WINNING IN THE NATIONAL POLLS? ANYONE WHO HAS EVER THOUGHT ABOUT RUNNING, TAKE HEART.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU. I AM REALLY DELIGHTED TO BE HERE ON THE FIRST WINTER DAY THE SEASON.   TO BE HERE IN  THIS BEAUTIFUL CITY IN CHURCH -- AND CHURCH THAT HAS BEEN THE SITE OF A LOT OF OCCASIONS. AND ESPECIALLY TO BE INTRODUCED BY BRENDA, WHO -- AS SHE SAID, I FIRST MET IN A TOWN HALL IN  DOVER. WHEN YOU CALL ON PEOPLE IN TOWN HALLS, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO SAY OR WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO ASK. WHEN I CALLED ON HER, SHE BASICALLY SAID I HAVE A HUSBAND WITH EARLY ONSET ALZHEIMER'S, I  HAVE A MOTHER WITH ALZHEIMER'S. I'M TAKING CARE OF THEM. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S? IT REALLY CAUSED ME TO THINK HARD ABOUT THE KIND OF PRESIDENT I WANT TO BE. OBVIOUSLY, I WANT TO BE A PRESIDENT WHO GETS THE ECONOMY MOVING FOR EVERYBODY. AND GET INCOMES RISING AND MORE GOOD PAYING JOBS. I WANT TO BE A PRESIDENT THAT KEEPS US SAFE AND SECURE AND TAKES ON THE THREAT AND DANGERS THAT WE FACE. I ALSO WANT TO BE A PRESIDENT WHO WORKS FOR FAMILIES, LIKE BRENDA'S. WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THE  PROBLEMS WE KEEP YOU UP AT NIGHT ARE ONES THAT WE ALSO HAVE TO TAKE SERIOUSLY. IT MEANS THE WORLD TO ME TO HAVE HER SUPPORT IN THIS CAMPAIGN. AND, AS I'VE SAID TO HER AND TO OTHERS WHO HAVE RAISED ISSUES WITH ME DURING THE COURSE OF MY  TIME HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO TRY AND FIND ANSWERS. ALZHEIMER'S, AS SHE SAID, WE HAVE 5 MILLION PEOPLE CURRENTLY  SUFFERING. THE PROJECTION IS FOR MANY MILLIONS MORE. IT IS THE SIXTH LEADING CAUSE OF  DEATH IN AMERICA. BUT UNLIKE THE OTHER CAUSES IN THE TOP 10, THERE IS NO REAL PATH TO PREVENTION OR EFFECTIVE TREATMENT, WORK YOUR. AS THERE IS WITH OTHER DISEASES THAT TAKE SO MANY LIVES. MY PROPOSAL IS THAT WE TACKLE  ALL THREE OF THOSE. WHAT CAN WE DO TO TRY AND PREVENT IT? WHAT CAN WE DO TO TRY AND MORE EFFECTIVELY TREATED? -- TREAT  IT? AND WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO INVEST IN FINDING A CURE? AFTER TALKING TO EXPERTS, THE LEADING EXPERTS IN OUR COUNTRY -- NOT JUST IN ALZHEIMER'S, BUT IN OTHER NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES, LIKE PARKINSON'S, THE OVERWHELMING RESPONSE WAS IF WE INVESTED JUST $2 BILLION MORE A  YEAR, WE WOULD MAKE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS. WE WOULD HAVE A REAL SHOT AT UNDERSTANDING MORE ABOUT THIS DISEASE, AND TRYING TO CURE IT. AND THE HEAVENS AND SUPPORT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO ON BEHALF OF ALZHEIMER'S AND THE PATIENTS, THE FAMILIES, AND THE CAREGIVERS.   I WANT TO THANK MY FRIEND TERRY MARELLI, WHO I SEE HERE, FOR HER GREAT SERVICE AND LEADERSHIP OVER SO MANY YEARS, AND FOR FRIENDSHIP. I WANT TO JUST MAKE A FEW OTHER QUICK ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. AND THEN WE WILL MOVE ON TO BE READY FOR THE QUESTIONS.  THE MAYOR. I WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR. WHERE IS MAYOR LISTER? I SAW HIM SOMEWHERE. THERE HE IS. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MAYOR. WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU, THANK YOU  FOR YOUR SUPPORT. AND TO THE CHURCH, THANK YOU FOR LETTING US BE HERE TODAY.   AND IT TO THE OVERFLOW, WHICH I STOPPED BY TO SEE ON MY WAY HERE. IT WAS PACKED. WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. THEY HAVE A BIG SCREEN, THEY ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME WATCHING. WE ARE DELIGHTED THEY ARE HERE  AS WELL. AS BRENDA SAID, ON JANUARY 20, 2017 -- SOMEONE WILL RAISE A HAND TO TAKE YOUTH OF OFFICE AND BECOME OUR 45TH PRESIDENT. THAT PERSON WILL, AFTER BEING SWORN IN AND THE CELEBRATIONS THAT GO WITH AN INAUGURATION, GO INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, GO INTO THE OVAL OFFICE, AND FACE THE CHALLENGES THAT AWAIT. BE A CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTION IN SO MANY WAYS. BECAUSE WE'VE WORKED TO DO. -- WE HAVE WORK TO DO. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE WORK TO DO. I'M OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE WORK WE CAN DO TOGETHER.   BUT I NEED ALL  OF YOU TO BE PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN. TO BE PART OF THE FIRST IN THE NATION PRIMARY. BECAUSE IN MANY WAYS, YOU ARE THE FIRST -- DEPENDING ON HOW YOU DEFINE IT, THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE. THE DECISION THAT HAMPSHIRE  MAKES IS SO IMPORTANT. I'VE HAD A GREAT TIME TRAVELING ACROSS THE STATE, MEETING BY NOW THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. HAVING A CHANCE TO SET FORTH MY IDEAS AND ANSWER QUESTIONS ON  WHATEVER MAY BE ON SOMEONE'S MIND. AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION. NOT BECAUSE MY NAME WILL BE ON THE BALLOT, BUT BECAUSE ALL OF US KNOW WHAT THE STAKES ARE. AND HOW HIGH THEY HAPPEN TO BE. SO I'M EXCITED, AND VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SPRINT  TOWARDS THE PRIMARY. AND TO HAVE A CHANCE TO HEAR EVEN MORE FOR MORE FOLKS HERE IN THE GRANITE STATE ABOUT WHAT IS ON YOUR MIND. ABOUT THE BIG ECONOMIC CHALLENGES, THE SECURITY ISSUES,  AND ALL THOSE PROBLEMS THEY KEEP YOU UP AT NIGHT. I HAVE LEARNED A LOT, LISTENING TO FOLKS HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE STRUGGLES, THE OPPORTUNITIES, THE DISAPPOINTMENTS. AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE HAD TWO FULL  TOWNHALL MEETINGS JUST ON THE ISSUE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE. WHEN I MADE A LIST OF WHAT I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN, IT WASN'T ON THAT LIST. ON MY FIRST TRIP. NEW HAMPSHIRE -- ON MY FIRST TRIP TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, THAT WAS WHAT WAS RAISED WITH ME. AND THEN VISIT AFTER VISIT, I WAS GIVEN MASS CARDS SHOWING THE PICTURES OF BEAUTIFUL YOUNG  PEOPLE NO LONGER WITH US BECAUSE  OF OVERDOSES. I MET THOSE IN RECOVERY, WHO THANKFULLY, WERE ABLE TO GET HELP WHEN THEY NEEDED IT. I MET GRANDMOTHERS LIKE MYSELF, RAISING CHILDREN BECAUSE THEIR CHILDREN COULDN'T. LOST TO OPIOID ADDICTION, HEROIN  ADDICTION. THAT'S WHY TAKING THE BIG ISSUE TO ME. I WILL NEVER STOP LEADING WITH THE VALUES I WAS RAISED WITH, ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS AMERICANS,  WHAT WE'RE CAPABLE OF DOING. I WILL NEVER STOP LISTENING,  LEARNING ABOUT WHAT'S ON PEOPLE'S MINDS. I THINK YOU EXIT LEARN MORE WHEN YOU LISTEN. -- I THINK YOU ACTUALLY LEARN MORE WHEN YOU LISTEN. AND I WILL EVER STOP WORKING WITH YOU TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. THAT IS THE AMERICA I WAS RAISED IN. THAT WAS THE AMERICA I THINK WE ALL SHARE IT SHOULD. -- CHERISH. AND THAT'S THE AMERICA I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN AS YOUR PRESIDENT TO MAKE SURE IT IS STRONGER, AT HER, FAIRER FOR EVERYONE GOING FORWARD. -- STRONGER, THATBETTER, FAIRER  FOR EVERYONE  GOING FORWARD.  HILLARY CLINTON: LET ME NOW TURN TO ALL OF YOU. IF YOU RAISE YOUR HAND, I THINK WE HAVE MICROPHONE SOMEWHERE  THAT WE WILL TRY TO GET TO YOU. AND GIVE YOU A CHANCE. THIS WOMAN RIGHT THERE. PLEASE STAND UP.  HAVE ANY OF YOU HEARD THIS BEFORE THAT SENIORS WHO NEED HELP APPEARING CANNOT AFFORD TO GET THE HEARING AIDS BECAUSE THEY ARE SO EXPENSIVE?   A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT WE WOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO SOLVE IN THE AFFORDABLE  CARE ACT, BUT WE HAVEN'T YET. IT'S SOMETHING I TAKE REALLY SERIOUSLY.  IF YOU CAN'T HEAR WELL, VERY OFTEN, PEOPLE KIND OF WITHDRAWAL. THEY BECOME MORE ISOLATED. SOME OF THE RECENT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT BACK AND BE A TRIGGER FOR OTHER KINDS OF CONDITIONS. I DON'T THINK HEARING AIDS, WHEN YOU CAN'T HEAR, OUR LUXURY. THEY ARE A NECESSITY. I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN --    TO MOVE THEM FROM WHAT WOULD BE THE ELECTIVE LIST, TO A SUPPORTED LIST, SO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS WILL BE ABLE TO GET HELP TO AFFORD THEM. BECAUSE YOU ARE 100% RIGHT. IT'S A GROWING CONCERN. IN PART, BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT MORE PEOPLE LIVING LONGER. IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT MORE PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HEARING EARLIER. SOME PEOPLE SAY IT'S BECAUSE OF LOUD MUSIC THAT SOME OF US ARE MEMBER LISTENING TO.  BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON, THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES AROUND IT. I'M GOING TO DO WHAT I CAN TO MAKE SURE WE MAKE HEARING AIDS FINANCIALLY AVAILABLE ON A SLIDING SCALE, SO MORE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM CAN ACTUALLY GET THEM.   THIS GENTLEMAN RIGHT THERE.  IN THE YELLOW TIE. HERE COMES THE MICROPHONE.  WE WILL DO THAT WHEN WE FINISH. DON'T LET ME FORGET. BUT THE PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA,  AND WAS BEEN ELECTED TWICE COME AS YOU RIGHTLY SAY, THE FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT ANYWHERE ON THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA HAS BEEN --    HAS BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY LEADER. SHE INHERITED AN ECONOMY IN A GOVERNMENT THAT WAS BANKRUPT. THEY HAD THIS TERRIBLE, LONG CIVIL WAR THAT ARE JUST DESTROYED SO MUCH OF THEIR PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY, IN ADDITION TO TAKING SO MANY LIVES IN LEAVING SO MANY MAIMED AND INJURED PEOPLE BEHIND.  A LOT OF LIBERIANS LEFT LIBERIA  BECAUSE OF THE LAUGH -- THE LACK OF SAFETY. SHE HAS BEEN, I THINK, INCREDIBLY FOCUSED ON TRYING TO IMPROVE THE GOVERNMENT. IMPROVE THE ECONOMY.  AND THEN SHE WAS DEALT THE TERRIBLE BLOW OF EBOLA. THEN ALL THAT IT MEANT TO HER COUNTRY. I WANT TO TELL YOU A QUICK STORY. IT'S GOOD TO REMEMBER HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO KEEP TRYING  TO WORK WITH PEOPLE, EVEN IF YOU HAVE SERIOUS DISAGREEMENTS WITH THEM. I WENT TO VISIT THE PRESIDENT  WHY WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.  I GOT A BIG BRIEFING FROM ALL OF HER TOP OFFICIALS ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN HER GOVERNMENT. AND WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. AND THEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO SPEAK TO THE PARLIAMENT. THERE CONGRESS. SHE TOOK ME ASIDE AND SAID I WANT YOU TO GO SPEAK ABOUT HOW HARD DEMOCRACY IS. HOW HARD WE MUST WORK TOGETHER. HOW WE HAVE TO MOVE PAST THE PAST. AND THEN SHE SAID TO ME, SOME OF THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW IN THE PARLIAMENT ARE PEOPLE WHO  WERE VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN THE CIVIL WAR. IN SOME OF THE TERRIBLE THINGS  THAT HAPPENED THERE. THE LEADERS WENT TO WAR CRIMES  TRIBUNALS. BUT OTHERS, FOR WHOM THERE WAS  IN EVIDENCE, WITH A PLAYED MINOR ROLES, WERE ACTUALLY ELECTED.  YOU CAN IMAGINE. SO I GO TO THE PARLIAMENT AND I  SPEAK ABOUT DEMOCRACY AND ALL  THE REST OF IT. I TAKE SOME PICTURES AND DO SOME VISITS AFTERWARDS. I THOUGHT BOY, WE THINK WE HAVE IT HARD. HERE SHE IS, TRYING TO WORK WITH A CONGRESS THAT INCLUDES PEOPLE  WHO WERE MORTAL ENEMIES WITH ONE ANOTHER AGAINST HER, AGAINST OTHERS. AND SHE IS WORKING SO HARD TO  MAKE THIS DEMOCRACY WHEN IT SHOULD BE. AGAINST TREMENDOUS ODDS. SO WHEN WE COMPLAIN ABOUT OUR PROBLEMS HERE IN OUR COUNTRY, WE  NEED TO PUT THEM IN THE FIRST -- INTO SOME PERSPECTIVE. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE WORK TOGETHER EVEN WITH PEOPLE WE DISAGREE WITH GOING INTO THE FUTURE. SO THANK YOU.  WE WILL TAKE A PICTURE. I PROMISE. THIS YOUNG LADY IN THE RED. THEN I WILL GO FURTHER BACK.  REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE. HILLARY CLINTON: HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WITH MENTAL HEALTH  PROBLEMS?   HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO GET THE MEDICAL CARE YOU NEED TO HELP SOMEBODY WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS? WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING IS  EXACTLY THE CASE. WE PASSED A LAW -- I REMEMBER VOTING FOR IT BACK IN THE DAY,  ANOTHER WAS ANOTHER LAW PASSED, AND INCORPORATED INTO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, OR WHAT THEY CALL PARITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH TRADE IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU HAVE A PHYSICAL ILLNESS,  WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE, YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET TREATED FOR IT. IF YOU HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH  ILLNESS, YOU NEED TO GET TREATED FOR THAT TOO. NUMBER ONE, WE NEED FINALLY TO REMOVE THE STIGMA FOR MENTAL HEALTH.   TOO OFTEN, I HEAR FROM PARENTS WHO SAY I NO LONGER EVEN TELL PEOPLE THAT MY SON HAS SCHIZOPHRENIA, MY DAUGHTER IS BIPOLAR, MY CHILD  HAS GOT CHRONIC DEPRESSION. BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M JUDGED. WE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN OPERATES. THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO DO. THAT'S PART OF WHAT MY GOAL IS  FOR ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH. WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE BRAIN. WE HAVE TO UNLOCK ITS SECRETS. I APPLAUD PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR THE INVESTMENT IN THE BRAIN PROJECT THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE. WE NEED TO REMOVE THE STIGMA, WE NEED TO ENFORCE THE LAW SO YOU GET THE QUALITY AND THE NUMBER OF TREATMENTS YOU NEED, WHETHER IT'S OUTPATIENT OR INPATIENT. I'M GOING TO WORK WITH A MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITY, WHICH IS LAID OUT AN AGENDA ABOUT HOW WE GET THIS RIGHT, ONCE AND FOR ALL. BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR. IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE PERSON SUFFERING, IT'S CERTAINLY NOT FAIR TO THE FAMILIES WHO ARE TRYING TO COPE WITHOUT SUFFERING  AND GET THE MEDICAL CARE THAT IS NEEDED. I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE IT SOMEWHAT EASIER FOR YOU  AND YOUR SON, GOING FORWARD.   THIS YOUNG MAN RIGHT HERE.  WOW. I'M GOING TO DO EVERY THING I CAN DO. I'M NEVER GOING TO STOP TRYING. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, WE LOSE 90 PEOPLE A DAY TO GUN VIOLENCE. HOMICIDES, SUICIDES, AND TRAGIC, AVOIDABLE ACCIDENTS. THAT'S 33,000 PEOPLE A YEAR. I THINK WE NEED TO PASS SOME LAWS THAT I HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR. WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS. WE NEED TO CLOSE THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE. CLOSE THE ONLINE LOOPHOLE.   AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED TO MAKE THE JUDGMENT ABOUT WHETHER SOMEONE IS QUALIFIED TO BUY A GUN IS IN THE RECORD. VERY OFTEN, WE DON'T HAVE REAL-TIME INFORMATION. BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE TO CLOSE WHAT IS CALLED THE CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE. WHERE THE KILLER IN CHARLESTON WENT TO BUY A GUN. HE FILLED OUT THE FORM. UNDER THE LOOPHOLE, HE COULD  COME BACK AND GET IT AFTER THREE  BUSINESS DAYS. THE INFORMATION THAT HE WASN'T ELIGIBLE BECAUSE HE HAD A FELONY CONVICTION DIDN'T COME THROUGH  UNTIL AFTER HE WENT AND USE THAT GUN AND MURDERED NINE PEOPLE. IN A CHURCH LIKE THIS, IN  CHARLESTON. SO WE HAVE WORK TO DO. AND THE MENTAL HEALTH PIECE OF THIS IS ESPECIALLY TROUBLING. BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO  UNFAIRLY SIGNIFIES PEOPLE, BUT YOU WANT TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITY, SO YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE  INFORMATION. THE KILLER AT VIRGINIA TECH, YOU MIGHT REMEMBER, HAVE BEEN COMMITTED. BUT THAT INFORMATION WAS NOT IN THE RECORDS. WE NEED TO PROHIBIT PEOPLE WHO ARE DRASTIC ABUSERS WITH RESTRAINING ORDERS AGAINST THEM FROM GETTING GUNS. AND WE CERTAINLY SHOULD GET THE CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT ANYONE WHO  IS ON THE NO-FLY LIST, THE WOULD-BE TERRORISTS, FROM BUYING GUNS IN AMERICA.   AND WE NEED TO REPEAL THE IMMUNITY FROM LIABILITY THAT WAS EVEN TO GUNMAKERS AND SELLERS BY THE CONGRESS.   SO THAT WE CAN DO AS GOOD A JOB AS POSSIBLE, TRYING TO PREVENT PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE GUNS IN THE FIRST PLACE FROM GETTING THEM. I KNOW WE CAN DO THIS IN A  CONSTITUTIONALLY CONSISTENT WAY. SO I'M GOING TO REACH OUT AND  WORK WITH ANYBODY, BUT I WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR THIS. BECAUSE WE ARE IN A WHOLE DIFFERENT ERA, WHERE THESE MASS SHOOTINGS, THESE 33,000 PEOPLE KILLED EVERY YEAR HAS BECOME A  REBUKE TO US. THAT WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS. I, PERSONALLY, AM ASKING GUN OWNERS TO SUPPORT THESE CHANGES. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, WHAT I JUST OUTLINED -- COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS AND THE LIKE, IS SUPPORTED BY 92% OF AMERICANS. AND 85% OF GUN OWNERS. BUT THE GUN LOBBY LIVES OFF OF FEAR AND MISINFORMATION. IT IS WILLING TO SAY AND DO WHATEVER IT TAKES --   AND IT IS REALLY TIME FOR GUN OWNERS TO FORM A DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION THAT WILL DO MORE ON GUN SAFETY,  DO MORE ON GUN RESPONSIBILITY, AND HAND UP FOR THE SAFETY -- STAND UP TO THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN AND OUR COMMUNITIES.   THIS GENTLEMAN WITH THE CAP ON HAS BEEN STANDING UP. WHEN A U.S. THE NEXT QUESTION --  WHY DON'T YOU ASK THE NEXT QUESTION?  THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR BEING AN ORGANIZER AND REACHING OUT TO YOUNG PEOPLE. THAT IS SO IMPORTANT.   I HOPE YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID. THINK ABOUT THIS NUMBER. 5.6 MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE BETWEEN  16 YEARS OLD AND 24 YEARS OLD, WHO ARE NEITHER IN SCHOOL, NOR WORK IN THAT IS A RECIPE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT, OR INCARCERATION,  FOR ALL KINDS OF BEHAVIOR THAT  HAS BAD CONSEQUENCES FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES. IT SOMETHING I CARE DEEPLY  ABOUT, BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE -- UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES HAVE HAD A RESURGENCE OF POVERTY. INNER-CITY, OLD SUBURBS, SMALL TOWNS AND RURAL AREAS. NATIVE AMERICAN RESERVATIONS, COAL COUNTRY, THIS IS ACROSS AMERICA. WHAT WE HAVE DISCONNECTED YOUNG PEOPLE FROM A PATH TO A PRODUCTIVE LIFE. I THINK WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE REBUILD THAT. I'M ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED.  LET ME SAY THREE THINGS. I WANT TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS LIKE  WHAT YOU DESCRIBED YOU DO, BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO GET PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITIES -- IT'S  LITERALLY A ONE ON ONE PROJECT  IN MANY CASES. WHAT IS IT THAT CAN BE DONE FOR JOHN OR MARY OR WHOMEVER? WE NEED TO SUPPORT NONPROFIT GROUPS, ADVOCACY GROUPS,  ORGANIZING GROUPS, FAITH  COMMUNITIES TO DO THIS WORK. SECONDLY, WE HAVE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK.  ONE OF THE IDEAS I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT -- IF WE TAKE A HARD LOOK AT COMMUNITIES WHERE YOU HAVE VERY PERSISTENT POVERTY . FOR EDUCATION OUTCOMES, OTHER  KINDS OF INDICATORS OF PROBLEMS -- POOR EDUCATION OUTCOMES, THE KIND OF INDICATORS OF PROBLEMS. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS. PEOPLE OF TRY DIFFERENT THINGS,  AND A LOT OF IT DOESN'T WORK. THROWING MONEY AT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY WORK. BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS IS THE WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE. HOW DO WE DO THAT? I DON'T THINK THE ANSWER LIES IN WASHINGTON, ALTHOUGH AS PRESIDENT, I CAN BE A CONVENER, A COORDINATOR, CATALYST, IS A ORDER. I THINK WE HAVE TO DO THIS IN COMMUNITIES. AND I WANT TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO GIVE MORE PEOPLE A CHANCE TO DO THAT RELATIONSHIP BUILDING. WE ARE GOING TO NEED MORE GED PROGRAMS VERY WE NEED MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS. WE NEED MORE PRESSURE PROGRAMS. WE'RE GOING TO NEED MORE  PATHWAYS OUT. AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE LIVING CONDITIONS AND THE SCHOOLING  CONDITIONS THAT A LOT OF THESE KIDS FACE. I USED TO HAVE I CALL THAT SHELTI TEST, WHEN I WOULD GO INTO THE SCHOOL. -- THE CHELSEA TEST. I WOULD WALK INTO A SCHOOL AND I WOULD SPEND SOME TIME, I WOULD LOOK AROUND AND LOOK AT THE PHYSICAL FACILITIES, TALK TO THE STAFF AREA AND I WOULD SAY WHAT I WANT MY DAUGHTER TO GO TO THE SCHOOL? A LOT OF TIMES THE ANSWER WAS YES, ABSOLUTELY. A LOT OF TIME, THE ANSWER WAS  NO. SOME OF THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN THE SCHOOLS WAS DEPLORABLE. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE HOUSING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN. A LOT OF THIS HOUSING IS REALLY  SUBSTANDARD. BUT IN DANGEROUS WAYS.  I WILL END WITH THIS -- LEAD PAINT POISONING EFFECTS MANY,  MANY CHILDREN IN THE NORTHEAST, THE MID-ATLANTIC, AND THE MIDWEST, WHERE WE HAD A LOT OF OLD HOUSING. WHERE WE HAVE OLD PIPES FOR WATER SUPPLIES. LEAD POISONING IS ACADEMIC AND BEHAVIORAL DEFICITS INDUCEMENTS. PEOPLE END UP BEING WORSE OFF.  AND WE ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO NOTICE THE, TO DEAL WITH IT, TO ERADICATE IT. THERE'S A LOT I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT. AND I WILL DO THAT. BUT IT WILL BE IN PARTNERSHIP  WITH YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND THE GROUPS YOU RECOGNIZE AND  REPRESENT. THANK YOU.   I SEE A HAND WAY BACK THERE. BLACK AND WHITE.  I HAVE BEEN DOWN AM TWICE ALREADY IN THIS CAMPAIGN. AND I WILL DO MY BEST TO HELP REBUILD THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN PLACES WHERE IT HASN'T BEEN PARTICULARLY SUCCESSFUL IN  RECENT YEARS. I THINK THERE IS A LOT WE CAN RECOMMEND. I REALLY DO. I THINK THAT OUR VIEW ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO GET THE ECONOMY GOING AGAIN, AND FIX ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND GET EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION -- YOU  KNOW, THERE IS A VERY INCONVENIENT FACT THAT MY  REPUBLICAN FRIENDS HATE WHEN I  MENTIONED. BUT IT IS TRUE. OUR ECONOMY DOES BETTER WHEN WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE.   AND THAT IS TRUE IN ALABAMA, JUST LIKE IT'S TRUE ANYWHERE. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THAT CASE, DO THE VERY BEST WE CAN TO KIND OF GET PEOPLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. AND GETTING THE ECONOMY TO WORK BETTER, GETTING OUR GOVERNMENT TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE AND  PRODUCTIVE IN PRODUCING RESULTS,  BUILDING ON THE PROGRESS THAT  PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE IT --  REMEMBER, HE INHERITED THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION.  AND THEN HE HAD TO MAKE SURE IT DIDN'T FALL INTO A DEPRESSION. I DON'T THINK HE GETS THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR MAKING SURE THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.   WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THAT CASE. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THAT CASE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. I HOPE, EFFECTIVELY. I'M COUNTING ON THAT. THE MAN IN THE BLUE VEST.  THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THERE IS A LITTLE HAND RIGHT THERE, THAT LITTLE GIRL RIGHT THERE. I LIKE HAVING ALL OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE HERE.  A VERY GOOD QUESTION, ELLA.   THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE STUDENT DEBT, OR WHOEVER HAD STUDENT DEBT? THAT'S NEARLY EVERYBODY HERE.  THERE ARE TWO BIG THINGS WE HAVE TO DO. FIRST, I WANT TO MAKE COLLEGE DEBT-FREE, SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BORROW MONEY FOR TUITION TO GO TO A FOUR-YEAR PUBLIC COLLEGES UNIVERSITY. AND IT WILL WORK, BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS TO FOCUS ON IT BEING A COMPACT BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S AND STATE GOVERNMENTS, AND INSTITUTIONS. I DO THINK THAT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE TO TAKE A REALLY HARD LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE SPENDING MONEY ON. SO THAT THEY MAKE SURE WHAT THEY ARE SPENDING ON IS RELATED TO HELPING PREPARE A STUDENT FOR LIFE, FOR PROFESSIONAL CAREER. I THINK STATES HAVE JUST  INVESTED IN HIGHER EDUCATION AREA A LOT OF THE MONEY THAT STATES USE TO PUT INTO COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAS GONE INTO EVERYTHING FROM PRISONS TO  ROADS, YOU NAME IT. WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE STATE DOES MORE THAN ITS FAIR SHARE. -- MORE OF ITS FAIR SHARE. IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE DEBT, FAMILIES ABOVE A CERTAIN INCOME LEVEL WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO FUND COLLEGE. I THINK THAT'S ONLY FAIR. AND I WANT STUDENTS TO WORK 10 HOURS A WEEK. BECAUSE I WANT STUDENTS TO KNOW THEY ARE WORKING FOR THEIR EDUCATION. IN THAT IT IS SOMETHING THEY REALLY VALUE.   I WANT TO DO MORE ON NATIONAL SERVICE. SO MORE STUDENTS GET BIG DISCOUNTS BECAUSE THEY WILL IT DONE NATIONAL SERVICE. MILITARY SERVICE, CIVILIAN SERVICE.   WE HAVE A GOOD G.I. BILL NOW COMING AFTER 9/11,  A NEW G.I. BILL FOR THE NEW  GENERATION OF THAT. -- OF VETS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T GET RIPPED OFF. SOMETIMES THAT MONEY IS GOING TO INSTITUTIONS THAT DON'T REALLY  SERVE THEM WELL. WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT ON RIGHT. AND I WANT TO HELP YOU PAY DOWN YOUR DEBT BY REFINANCING YOUR DEBT. JUST LIKE YOU CAN REFINANCE A MORTGAGE OR A CAR PAYMENT. YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO REFINANCE OR COLLEGE DEBT.   AND IT REALLY IS QUITE DISTURBING TO ME THAT WE HAVE HAD, AS EVERYBODY KNOWS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, BECAUSE OF THE GREAT RECESSION, MOSTLY -- WE'VE HAD REALLY LOW  INTEREST RATES. AND YET WHEN I ASK STUDENTS WHAT INTEREST RATE THEY ARE PAYING ON THEIR DEBT, LOTS OF THEM ARE PAYING 6%, 7% FROM 8%, 9%, 10%. SOME OF IT PRIVATE, SOME OF IT  TO THE GOVERNMENT. I DO NOT BELIEVE THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE MAKING UP OFF IT OFF OF LENDING MONEY TO STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO GO GET A  COLLEGE EDUCATION.   SO WE ARE GOING  TO MAKE A LOT OF CHANGES, ELLA. CERTAINLY BY THE TIME YOU GET THERE. HOPEFULLY SOONER. WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF GOOD CHANGES YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. THERE'S A LADY RIGHT HERE. HERE COMES THE MICROPHONE.  YES. I HAPPEN TO THINK THE PARIS  AGREEMENT WAS AN HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENTS. I GIVE A LOT OF CREDIT TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LEADERSHIP. IF THE UNITED STATES IS NOT LED, WOULD NOT HAPPEN. AND I KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS,  BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WENT TO THE BIG INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE MEETING IN COPENHAGEN IN 2009. AND LITERALLY, WE COULD NOT EVEN GET A MEETING WITH THE CHINESE, THE INDIANS, THE SOUTH AFRICAN TOM AND THE BRAZILIANS. LED BY THE CHINESE, WHO DID NOT  WANT TO HAVE THE MEETING WITH US WHERE THEY MIGHT MAKE A COMMITMENT TO ACTUALLY DOING  ANYTHING. AND SO WE HAD TO CHASE THEM AROUND THIS BIG CONVENTION CENTER IN COPENHAGEN. WE FINALLY FOUND THEM, THE CHINESE GUARDS WERE PREVENTING  THE ENTRY IN. THE PRESIDENT IS A LOT TALLER THAN I AM. SO HE KIND OF PUSHED THROUGH IN  THE HANDS WENT UP AND I DUCKED UNDER AND WE GOT IN THE ROOM. AND THE PRESIDENT SAYS WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU. WE PULLED UP CHAIRS AND WE SAT DOWN AND SAID LOOK, WE HAVE TO  BEGIN THIS PROCESS. THEIR ARGUMENT WAS THE TYPICAL ARGUMENT. WE DIDN'T CAUSE THE PROBLEM. IT WAS THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. WE SAID THAT'S FINE. BUT YOU ARE NOW THE BIGGEST  EMITTERS. AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  AND THEY BEGAN TO AGREE TO DO SOME INTERNAL ACCOUNTING AND  PUBLIC REPORTING. FAST FORWARD FROM 2009, WE HAD A SERIES OF CLIMATE MEETING IN CANCUN AND URBAN. AND WE MADE PROGRESS. THE AGREEMENT COMING OUT OF PARIS DOES, FOR THE FIRST TIME, INCLUDE EVERY NATION -- REGARDLESS OF LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT OR NEED MORE THREAT  OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND NOW, WE HAVE TO ENFORCE IT. AS PRESIDENT, I WOULD DO EVERYTHING I CAN, USING EVERY TOOL THAT I HAVE, TO HOLD OTHER NATIONS ACCOUNTABLE. INCLUDING OUR OWN. ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO BOTH TO TRY DESPERATELY TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS  TOWARDS CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY,  TO TRY TO AT LEAST PUT A CAP ON TEMPERATURE RISE AND EMISSIONS. AND TRY THE BEST WE CAN AT THE SAME TIME TO DO MORE ON RESILIENCE AND ADAPTATION, TO TRY AND HELP COUNTRIES AND PARTS OF COUNTRIES THAT ARE PARTICULARLY AT RISK. PORTSMOUTH IS THE SEACOAST CITY. I KNOW THE MAYOR AND IS WORKING HARD ON RESILIENCE AND YOU ARE REALLY TAKING A HARD LOOK GREAT YOU NEED A PARTNER IN WASHINGTON AND IN THE CONGRESS, AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENT. THERE ARE A LOT OF PLACES IN OUR COUNTRY -- ALASKA HAS ALREADY BEEN HIT HARD. THEY HAD TO RELOCATE THE VILLAGES FROM THE COASTLINE. I KNOW THAT MIAMI IS REALLY FACING SOME BIG CHALLENGES. WE HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT  THIS. BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENING. WE ARE SEEING THE RESULTS OF THIS DRASTIC INCREASE IN TEMPERATURES THAT HUMAN ACTIVITY HAS NOT JUST CONTRIBUTED TO, BUT  CAUSE. SO, IT'S TIME FOR US TO --    DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS. I BELIEVE IT'S ALSO A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS WHAT I HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING FROM MY REPUBLICAN COUNTERPARTS. THEY ALL ARE INTO DENIAL. AND WHEN ASKED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, TYPICALLY WILL SAY I DON'T KNOW, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST. THE ANSWER TO THAT IS GO TALK TO  ONE.  LISTEN TO WHAT THE SCIENTISTS  TELL YOU. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, WE HAVE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES HERE. THAT WE ARE LEAVING ON THE TABLE. WE CAN DO SO MUCH MORE, PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK IN WIND AND SOLAR AND ADVANCED BIOFUELS. WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE ECONOMY WITH NEW, GOOD PAYING JOBS ARE IN I WILL SAY THIS. WHEN NOT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, I OFTEN IN IOWA. IOWA NOW PRODUCES ONE THIRD OF ITS ELECTRICITY FROM A NEW LEVELS, PREDOMINANTLY WIND. 7000 PEOPLE NOW WORK IN THE WIND INDUSTRY. THEY ARE NOW ASSEMBLING TURBINES  IN OLD ABANDONED FACTORIES. THEY ARE EDUCATING YOUNG PEOPLE  IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ACTUALLY WORK ON THESE TURBINES. THEY HAVE GONE THE WHOLE SUPPLY  CHAIN GOOD FOR THEM. EVERY STATE SHOULD BE DOING THE SAME. EVERY STATE HAS THAT SAME ECONOMIC POTENTIAL HERE.   WHEN WE LET POLITICS -- REALLY POLITICS THAT ARE UNDER THE THUMB OF THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY, AND IN  PARTICULAR, THE KOCH BROTHERS, DECIDE THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY -- SHAME ON US. WE ARE BETTER THAN THAT, WE ARE SMARTER THAN THAT, AND WE ALL -- REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT, WHATEVER. WE ONLY TO SAY WE ARE TAKING ON THIS CHALLENGE, AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE JOBS AND INCOMES RISE BECAUSE OF IT. THAT, TO ME, IS THE RIGHT  APPROACH FOR US TO BE TAKING.   OH MY GOODNESS,  SO MANY HANDS, SO LITTLE TIME. WHEN WE GO WITH THIS LADY RIGHT HERE.  THANK YOU FOR WORKING IN OUR PRISONS. WE ARE STILL IN THE MIDST OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON. FOR THOSE OF US TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS, IT'S GOOD TO REMOVE HER THAT WE ARE CALLED UPON TO CARE FOR THE HOMELESS AND THE STRANGER, THE PRISONER. THE REFUGEE. THOSE ARE IMPORTANT REMINDERS AT  A TIME WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH POLITICAL DISPUTE ABOUT ALL OF THIS. I THINK WE HAVE INCARCERATED TOO MANY PEOPLE. WE HAVE 5% OF THE WORLDS  POPULATION. BUT 25% OF THE PRISON  POPULATION. WE ACTUALLY HAVE ONE THIRD OF  WOMEN WHO ARE IMPRISONED ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD IMPRISONED  IN THE UNITED STATES. SO, WE HAVE TO BEGIN IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY, TO DEAL WITH THE EFFECTS OF INCARCERATION. OBVIOUSLY, FROM MY PERSPECTIVE,  WE NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE LOW LEVEL, NONVIOLENT  OFFENSES FOR WHICH PEOPLE END UP INCARCERATED. WE HAVE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT  OUR BAIL SYSTEM, BECAUSE WE HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN JAIL AND PRISON WHO HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN TRIED YET. WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE GUILTY OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN POVERTY, BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MEET THE BAIL HAVE BEEN SET FOR THEM. AND WE NEED TO DO A CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF WHO CAN AND SHOULD BE RELEASED FROM PRISON, WHILE WE TRY TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T POSE A THREAT TO THE COMMUNITY. PARTICULARLY, THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH LOW-LEVEL DRUG  OFFENSES WHO NEED TREATMENTS, NOT IMPRISONMENT.   SO WE HAVE GOT TO LOOK AT ALL OF THIS AND -- I DON'T THINK THAT'S ENOUGH. IT WAS BACK TO THE GENTLEMAN'S  QUESTION THERE IN THE HAT . THE ISSUE IS IF WE ARE GOING TO DIVERT PEOPLE FROM PRISON, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN DRUG COURTS. I THINK DRUG COURTS OR A BETTER OPTION THAN IMPRISONING PEOPLE. THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN RECOVERY, THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I BELIEVE THERE ARE MORE  PROGRAMS THAT ARE CHEAPER AND  BETTER. I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT A PROGRAM I VISITED IN RENO, NEVADA. IT WAS A PROGRAM ORIGINALLY STARTED FOR ALCOHOLICS. PEOPLE WHO WERE FOUND ON THE STREET AND WERE PICKED UP, TAKEN TO JAIL. A MONTH LATER, THEY ARE ON THE STREET AGAIN, TAKEN TO JAIL. OR MAYBE THE ONE THAT BEING PUT INTO AN AMBULANCE, TAKEN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, MAYBE ADMITTED. A MONTH OR TWO LATER, BACK ON THE STREETS. A REALLY GREAT PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND CAP A CHARITIES -- CATHOLIC CHARITIES SAID THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY.  IT'S EXPENSIVE TO JAIL AND  IMPRISON PEOPLE. THEY BUILT A FACILITY THAT HAD SMALL BEDROOMS, THAT HAD WORK TO BE DONE. THAT OFFER THIS OPTION TO PEOPLE THEY WERE PICKING UP SAYING YOU  CAN EITHER GO BACK TO JAIL, BACK  TO THE LIFE YOU HAVE. OR YOU CAN TRY THIS. GOT ENOUGH PEOPLE TO TRY IT. THEY TESTED THAN THREE TIMES A DAY TO MAKE YOUR THEY WERE CHEATING. THE SHERIFF SAID YOU WANT TO KNOW THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS? I CAN JUSTIFY THIS ANYWHERE. HE SAID THE FIRST YEAR THE SHERIFF AND THE HOSPITAL IN THE JAIL SAVED $4 MILLION. THEY WERE NO LONGER PUTTING PEOPLE IN HIGH INTENSIVE PLACES LIKE JAILS AND EMERGENCY ROOM'S. NOW THEY ARE MOVING ON TO DRUG ADDICTION. BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT HOW TO HELP PEOPLE OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS THEY CONFRONT. AND I JUST DON'T THINK THAT JAIL IS A PLACE FOR PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS.  AND THEREFORE, WE NEED DIFFERENT  APPROACHES THAT WILL BE ACTUALLY BETTER AND CHEAPER. SO LET'S TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT. THIS YOUNG MAN.  GREAT QUESTION. THANK YOU DAD FOR US. IS YOUR DAD HERE? THANKS, DAD. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES -- I  WAS VERY PROUD OF THE UNITED STATES BEGAN -- BECAME THE FIRST  NATION IN THE WORLD TO OPEN  SCHOOLS TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. I WORKED ON THAT WHEN I WAS WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. WE WENT DOOR TO DOOR, ASKING PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE A SCHOOL-AGE CHILD WHO IS NOT IN SCHOOL. WE FOUND A BLIND KIDS AND KIDS  IN WHEELCHAIRS AND KIDS OF BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS.  WE GAVE ALL THE DATA TO THE CONGRESS, CONGRESS ACTED, AND SCHOOLS WERE OPENED. YOU START TO WONDER -- THE DISABILITIES -- AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY'S ACT WAS PASSED. AND NOW WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO MAKE SURE WE PROVIDE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING, AND WE SUPPORT FAMILIES. THE BIGGEST CONCERN THAT PEOPLE TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT I HAVE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES, PARTICULARLY WITH AUTISM, IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY ARE NO LONGER THERE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN, AND HOW WILL THAT WORK OUT. I AM ROLLING OUT A PLAN ABOUT AUTISM AND ABOUT A WEEK, WHERE I TALK ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT WE NEED TO DO TO TRY AND SUPPORT FAMILIES AND PEOPLE WHO ARE DIAGNOSED ALONG THE AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WITH AUTISM? WOW. WELL YOU KNOW, THE LATEST DATA  FROM THE CENTERS ON DISEASE CONTROL IS THAT ONE OUT OF 68 CHILDREN HAVE SOME FEATURE THAT WOULD PLACE THEM ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM. SO THAT IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO DEAL WITH. WE WILL BE ADDRESSING THAT. BUT I GUESS MY BOTTOM LINE IS -- WE HAVE COMMUNITIES -- WE, AS COMMUNITIES NEED TO SUPPORT FAMILIES AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES SO THAT WE CAN GO  AS FAR AS THEIR TALENT, THEIR SKILLS WILL TAKE THEM. THERE ARE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT THE WE CAN APPLY. I WILL TALK ABOUT MY ROLE THIS OUT. I JUST BEEN TOLD THIS IS MY LAST QUESTION. OH MY GOODNESS. I SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID THIS,  THIS IS TOTALLY UNFAIR.   YOU GOT  PROMOTERS RIGHT HERE. THIS YOUNG MAN.  YOU HAVE A WHOLE TEAM THAT IS GIVING YOU A CHANCE. GO AHEAD. I REALLY DO LOVE TO CALL ON KIDS. THAT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ACTUALLY ALL ABOUT, IS THEIR FUTURE.   MY NAME IS RIGHTLY, I'M FROM MASSACHUSETTS. MY MOTHER IS COMPLAINING THAT  SHE DOES NOT GET MUCH MORE MONEY THAN MY FATHER.    THAT IS REALLY SO SWEET.   YOU HAVE A GREAT FUTURE AS AN ADVOCATE. I DO THINK EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL  WORK IS STILL A PROBLEM. I THINK THE PAYCHECK FAIRNESS  ACT, WHICH I SUPPORTED EVERY  YEAR CAME UP WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE, IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO TRY TO OPEN UP THE PAY ARENA TO MORE TRANSPARENCY. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IF YOU ARE DOING A JOB AND YOU ASK HOW MUCH SOMEBODY ELSE MAKES, YOU CAN BE FIRED OR RETALIATED AGAINST. HOW ARE WE EVER GOING TO KNOW THAT WE GET FAIR PAY FOR NOT JUST WOMEN, ALTHOUGH THAT IS THE BIGGEST DISCREPANCY, BUT PARTICULARLY, PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POSITIONS WHERE IT IS HARD TO ASK FOR MORE BECAUSE OF THEIR WORKING CONDITIONS. I HAD A YOUNG MAN HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TELL ME THE REASON HE WAS SUPPORTING ME WAS BECAUSE I WAS IN FAVOR OF EQUAL PAY. I ASKED HIM WHY, HE SAID BECAUSE HE GOT HIS FIRST GROWN-UP ADULT JOB WHEN HE WAS 17 YEARS OLD. HE WENT TO WORK IN THE SAME STORE WHERE HIS MOTHER HAS WORKED, AND THAT'S HOW HE GOT THE JOB. HE BROUGHT HIS PAYCHECK HOME AND  SHOWED HIS MOTHER AND HE WATCHED HER FACE FALL. SHE SAID YOU ARE MAKING MORE NOW THAN I AM MAKING AFTER FOUR  YEARS ON THE SAME JOB . I ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE REASON. HE SAID I TRIED TO FIND OUT AND THE MANAGER SAID WE LIKE TO IDENTIFY YOUNG MEN WHO CAN GO FAR IN THE COMPANY, WE WANT TO GIVE YOU THE INCENTIVE JUST AMA AND MAYBE GET INTO ONE OF OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS. HE SAID THEY NEVER ASKED MY MOM, AND SHE IS MUCH MORE ORGANIZED THAN I AM. WE STILL HAVE PROBLEMS, AND IF YOU DENY THOSE PROBLEMS, YOU ARE DENYING THE FASTEST WAY TO INCREASE INCOMES IN AMERICA. AND THAT IS TO MAKE SURE WOMEN  ARE PAID WHAT THEY DESERVE IN THE JOBS THEY DO. THANK YOU ALL, VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ","Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton in Portsmouth, New Hampshire"

THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M DELIGHTED, DELIGHTED TO BE HERE AT THIS GREAT UNIVERSITY. ONE OF THE PREMIER PUBLIC INSTITUTIONSES OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY. YES. INDEED.   JUST, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THOSE   STATEMENTS OF FACT THAT  DESERVES A RESPONSE. I WANT TO THANK MY LONG-TIME   FRIEND, VICE PRESIDENT MONDALE,  FOR HIS KIND WORDS.  HIS SUPPORT IN THIS CAMPAIGN   MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO ME PERSONALLY, BECAUSE I ADMIRE SO  MUCH HIS SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY  . HE IS A GREAT MINNESOTAN AND A   GREAT AMERICAN AND WE'RE SO PRIVILEGED TO HAVE HIM WITH US TODAY.   I WANT TO  ACKNOWLEDGE A FEW OF THE OTHER   ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO ARE HERE.  I AM, OF COURSE, TO BE JOINED BY FORMER COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS AMY KLOBUCHAR AND AL FRANKEN WHO ARE THE DYNAMIC DUO FOR YOUR   STATE AND I'M THANKFUL TO THEM   FOR THEIR SUPPORT. I THANK TINA SMITH AND STEVE   SIMON, YOUR SECRETARY OF STATE.    AND I UNDERSTAND BETSY HODGES IS HERE, MAYOR OF   MINNEAPOLIS.   I ALSO WANT TO   ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEAN OF THE HUMPHREY SCHOOL, ERIC SCHWARTZ.  [CHEERS AND  ERIC WAS MY TOP  ADVISER ON REFUGEE ISSUES AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT. I ALSO HAD THE GREAT PRIVILEGE   OF WORKING WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS  ON THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL DURING MY HUSBAND'S ADMINISTRATION.  YOU KNOW, HE BRINGS A MIX OF EXPERTISE AND EMPATHY THAT HAS BEEN MISSING FROM MUCH OF OUR  PUBLIC DEBATE. AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT HE IS HERE TODAY, BUT I'M ALSO A LITTLE   JEALOUS THAT ALL OF YOU HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY GET TO HAVE THE   BENEFIT OF HIS EXPERIENCE. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, I  HAVE LISTENED TO THE PROBLEMS  THAT KEEP AMERICAN FAMILIES UP AT NIGHT.  MOST PEOPLE DON'T EXPECT LIFE TO BE EASY, BUT THEY WANT MORE SECURITY, A GOOD-PAYING JOB THAT LETS YOU AFFORD A MIDDLE-CLASS LIFESTYLE, HEALTH CARE YOU CAN   COUNT ON, A LITTLE BIT PUT AWAY  FOR YOUR RETIREMENT. BEING SECURE ALSO MEANS BEING SAFE, SAFE AT HOME, AT SCHOOL,   AT WORK. AND TODAY, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT  HOW WE KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE FL A THREAT THAT'S ON EVERYONE'S MIND, THE THREAT OF TERRORISM. BUT I WANT TO BEGIN BY SAYING,   WE CANNOT GIVE IN TO FEAR. WE CAN'T LET IT STOP US FROM   DOING WHAT IS RIGHT AND NECESSARY TO MAKE US SAFE AND DOING IT IN A WAY THAT IS  CONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES.    WE CANNOT LET FEAR PUSH US INTO RECKLESS ACTION THAT ENDS UP MAKING US LESS  SAFE. AMERICANS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO   ACT WITH BOTH COURAGE AND CLARITY. NOW, AS WE ALL KNOW, ON DECEMBER 2, TWO SHOOTERS KILLED 14 PEOPLE AT A HOLIDAY PARTY IN SAN BERNANDINO, CALIFORNIA. SADLY, IN AMERICA, IN 2015,  TURNING ON THE NEWS AND HEARING  ABOUT A MASS SHOOTING IS NOT UNUSUAL. BUT THIS ONE TURNED OUT TO BE DIFFERENT. BECAUSE THESE KILLERS WERE A   HUSBAND AND WIFE INSPIRED BY ISIS. AMERICANS HAVE EXPERIENCED   TERRORISM BEFORE. ON 9/11, WE LEARNED THAT   TERRORISTS IN AFGHANISTAN COULD STRIKE OUR HOMELAND FROM FORT HOOD TO CHATTANOOGA TO THE BOSTON MARATHON, WE SAW PEOPLE RADICALIZED HERE CARRYING OUT DEADLY ATTACKS.  BUT SAN BERNANDINO FELT DIFFERENT. MAYBE IT WAS THE TIMING COMING   SO SOON AFTER THE PARIS ATTACKS. MAYBE IT WAS HOW RANDOM IT   SEEMED. A TERRORIST ATTACK IN A SUBURBAN OFFICE PARK, NOT A HIGH-PROFILE  TARGET OR SYMBOL OF AMERICAN POWER. IT MADE US ALL FEEL IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYWHERE AT ANY TIME. THE PHRASE, ACTIVE SHOOTER   SHOULD NOT BE ONE WE HAVE TO   TEACH OUR CHILDREN.  BUT IT IS.   NOW WE ARE ALL GRAPPLING WITH WHAT THIS MEANS FOR OUR FUTURE, OUR SAFETY, OUR  SENSE OF WELL-BEING AND OUR  TRUST AND CONNECTIONS WITH OUR NEIGHBORS. WE WANT TO BE OPEN-HEARTED. AND WE WANT TO CELEBRATE AMERICA'S DIVERSITY, NOT FEAR  IT. AND WHILE WE KNOW THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE  HERE AND AROUND THE WORLD HATE ISIS AND LOVE PEACE, WE DO HAVE  TO BE PREPARED FOR MORE TERRORISTS PLOTTING ATTACKS. JUST YESTERDAY, A MAN IN   MARYLAND WAS CHARGED WITH  RECEIVING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FROM ISIS FOR USE IN PLANNING AN ATTACK. AND HERE IN MINNESOTA,   AUTHORITIES HAVE CHARGED 10 MEN WITH CONSPIRING TO PROVIDE   MATERIAL SUPPORT TO ISIS.  BUT IN THE TWIN CITIES, YOU HAVE ALSO SEEN FIRSTHAND HOW COMMUNITIES COME TOGETHER TO RESIST RADICALIZATION. LOCAL IMAM MUCH H S CONDEMNING TERRORISTS AND LOCAL ACTIVISTS PUSHING BACK AGAINST PROPAGANDA. I MET WITH A GROUP OF COMMUNITY LEADERS WHO TOLD ME ABOUT SOME   OF THE WORK AND THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH. AS THE SIRS SOMALI POLICE SERGEANT IN MINNESOTA AND PROBABLY IN THE COUNTRY, SAID RECENTLY, SAFETY IS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY, SO WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER.   THE THREAT WE FACE IS DAUNTING, BUT AMERICA HAS OVERCOME BIG CHALLENGES MANY TIMES BEFORE.  THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY, WE'VE  STARED INTO THE FACE OF EVIL AND REFUSE TO BLINK. WE BEAT FACISM, WON THE COLD   WAR, BROUGHT OSAMA BIN LADEN TO  JUSTICE. SO NO ONE SHOULD UNDERESTIMATE THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND I'M CONFIDENT WE WILL ONCE   AGAIN CHOOSE RESOLVE OVER FEAR.    AND WE WILL DEFEAT THESE NEW ENEMIES JUST AS WE   HAVE DEFEATED THOSE WHO HAVE THREATENED US IN THE PAST  BECAUSE IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO CONTAIN ISIS, WE MUST DEFEAT   ISIS, AND NOT JUST ISIS, BUT THE BROADER RADICAL JIHADIST   MOVEMENT THAT ALSO INCLUDES AL   QAEDA AND OFFSHOOTS LIKE AL-SHABAAB IN SOMALIA. WAGING AND WINNING THIS FIGHT WILL REQUIRE SERIOUS LEADERSHIP. BUT FORTUNATELY, OUR POLITICAL   DEBATE HAS BEEN ANYTHING BUT   SERIOUS. WE CAN'T AFFORD ANOTHER MAJOR  GROUND WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT ISIS WANTS FROM US. SHALLOW SLOGANS DON'T ADD UP TO A STRATEGY.    PROMISING TO CARPET-BOMB UNTIL THE DESERT   GLOWS DOESN'T MAKE YOU SOUND   STRONG, IT MAKES YOU SOUND LIKE  YOU ARE IN OVER YOUR HEAD.   BLUSTER AND  BIGOTRY ARE NOT CREDENTIALS FOR BECOMING COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND  IT IS HARD TO TAKE SERIOUSLY   SNARS WHO TALK TOUGH BUT THEN HOLD UP KEY NATIONAL SECURITY  NOMINATIONS, INCLUDING THE TOP OFFICIAL AT THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR DISRUPTING TERRORIST FINANCING.   EVERY DAY THAT'S WASTED ON   PARTISAN GRIDLOCK COULD PUT  AMERICANS IN DANGER. SO, YES, WE NEED A SERIOUS   DISCUSSION AND THAT'S WHY IN A   SPEECH LAST MONTH BEFORE THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS, I  LAID OUT A THREE-PART PLAN TO DEFEAT ISIS AND THE BROADER EXTREMIST MOVEMENT. ONE, DEFEAT ISIS IN THE MIDDLE   EAST BY SMASHING ITS STRONG HOLD BY KILLING ITS LEADERS AND INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THE AIR AND INTENSIFYING SUPPORT FOR LOCAL   FORCES WHO CAN PURSUE THEM ON THE GROUND.  SECOND, DEFEAT THEM AROUND THE WORLD BY DISMANTLING THE GLOBAL  NETWORK OF TERROR THAT SUPPLIES  RADICAL JIHADDISTS WITH MONEY, ARMS, PROPAGANDA AND FIGHTERS. AND THIRD, DEFEAT THEM HERE AT   HOME BY FOILING PLOTS,   DISRUPTING RADICALIZATION AND  HARDENING OUR DEFENSES.  NOW THESE THREE LINES OF EFFORT  REINFORCE ONE ANOTHER. SO WE NEED TO PURSUE THEM ALL AT ONCE USING EVERY PILLAR OF AMERICAN POWER. IT WILL REQUIRE SKILLFUL   DIPLOMACY TO CONTINUE SECRETARY KERRY'S EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE   POLITICAL RECONCILIATION IN IRAQ AND POLITICAL TRANSITION IN SYRIA, ENABLING THE SUNNIS AND KURDISH FIGHTERS TO TAKE ON ISIS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER AND GET OUR ARAB AND TURKISH PARTNERS TO STEP UP AND DO THEIR PART.  IT WILL REQUIRE U.S. AND ALLIED AIR POUR BY STRIKES BIPLANES AND DRONES WITH PROPER SAFEGUARDS. IT WILL REQUIRE SPECIAL  OPERATIONS UNITS TO ADVISE AND   TRAIN LOCAL FORCES AND CONDUCT KEY COUNTERTERRORISM MISSIONS. WHAT IT WILL NOT REQUIRE IS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN COMBAT  TROOPS.  THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT ACTION FOR US TO TAKE IN THIS SITUATION. SO THERE IS A LOT TO DO. AND TODAY, I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE THIRD PART OF MY PLAN, HOW WE DEFEND OUR COUNTRY AND  PREVENT RADICALIZATION HERE AT   HOME.  WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO COUNTER EACH STEP IN THE  PROCESS THAT CAN LEAD TO AN ATTACK LIKE THE ONE IN SAN BERNANDINO. FIRST, WE HAVE TO SHUT DOWN ISIS' RECRUITMENT IN THE UNITED STATES, ESPECIALLY ONLINE. SECOND, STOP WOULD-BE JIHADDISTS FROM GETTING TRAINING OVERSEAS   AND STOP FOREIGN TERRORISTS FROM COMING HERE. THIRD, DISCOVER AND DISRUPT PLOTS BEFORE THEY CAN BE CARRIED OUT. FOURTH, SUPPORT LAW LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO RISK THEIR LIVES TO PREVENT AND   RESPOND TO ATTACKS. AND FIFTH, EMPOWER OUR MUSLIM-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE FIGHT AGAINST RADICALIZATION.    THIS IS A 360-DEGREE STRATEGY TO KEEP  AMERICA SAFE.  AND I WANT TO WALK THROUGH EACH  OF THE ELEMENTS FROM RECRUITMENT TO TRAINING, TO PLANNING, TO EXECUTION. FIRST, SHUTTING DOWN RECRUITMENT. WE HAVE TO STOP JIHADDISTS FROM RADICALIZING NEW RECRUITS IN SOCIAL MEDIA AND CHAT ROOMS AND  WHAT'S CALLED THE DARK WEB. TO DO THAT, WE NEED STRONGER RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WASHINGTON, SILICON VALLEY AND   ALL OF OUR GREAT TECH COMPANIES AND ENTREPRENEURS. AMERICAN INNOVATION IS A   POWERFUL FORCE AND WE HAVE TO PUT IT TO WORK DEFEATING ISIS. THAT STARTS WITH UNDERSTANDING WHERE AND HOW RECRUITMENT  HAPPENS. OUR SECURITY PROFESSIONALS NEED  TO MORE EFFECTIVELY TRACK AND ANALYZE AYESIS' SOCIAL POSTS AND MAP NETWORKS AND THEY NEED HELP  FROM THE TECH COMMUNITY. COMPANIES SHOULD REDOUBLE THEIR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE THEIR OWN SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER NECESSARY POLICIES TO  POLICE THEIR NETWORKS, IDENTIFYING EXTREMIST CONTENT  AND REMOVING IT. NOW, MANY ARE ALREADY DOING THIS AND SHARING THOSE BEST PRACTICES MORE WIDELY IS IMPORTANT. AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT, I STARTED AN INTERAGENCY CENTER TO COMBAT VIOLENCE JIHADIST   MESSAGES TO HAVE A BETTER WAY TO COMMUNICATE ON BEHALF OF OUR VALUES AND TO GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE DRAWN TO THOSE MESSAGES AN   ALTERNATIVE NARRATIVE. WE RECRUITED SPECIAL LIFTS,  FLUENT IN IRDUE AND SOMALI TO  WAGE ONLINE BATTLES WITH THE   EXTREMISTS.  THESE EFFORTS HAVE NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE THREAT, SO WE NEED TO   STEP UP OUR GAME IN PARTNERSHIP  WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND  CREDIBLE MODERATE VOICES OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT. THAT IS JUST SOMEWHAT WHAT WE  HAVE TO DO.  EXPERTS FROM THE F.B.I., THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, STATE  DEPARTMENT AND THE TECHNOLOGY  INDUSTRY SHOULD WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP A UNIFIED NATIONAL STRATEGY TO DEFEAT ISIS IN   CYBERSPACE USING ALL OF OUR  CAPABILITIES TO DENNY JIHADDISTS VIRTUAL TERRITORY JUST AS WE   WORK TO DENNY THEM ACTUAL TERRITORY. AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE TO DO  MORE TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGE OF RADICALIZATION, WHATEVER FORM IT TAKES. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE SAUDIS, THE KUWAITIS AND OTHERS STOP   THEIR CITIZENS FROM SUPPORTING   MADRASSAGS AND MOSQUES AROUND  THE WORLD ONCE AND FOR ALL.  AND THAT SHOULD BE THE TOP   PRIORITY IN ALL OF OUR   DISCUSSIONS WITH THESE   COUNTRIES. SECOND, WE HAVE TO PREVENT ISIS RECRUITS FROM TRAINING ABROAD  AND PREVENT FOREIGN JIHADDISTS FROM COMING HERE. MOST URGENT IS STEMMING THE FLOW FROM FIGHTERS FROM EUROPE AND IRAQ AND SYRIA AND THEN BACK   HOME AGAIN. THE UNITED STATES AND OUR ALLIES NEEDS TO KNOW THE IDENTITIES OF EVERY FIGHTER WHO MAKES THAT TRIP AND THEN SHARE INFORMATION  WITH EACH OTHER IN REAL-TIME.  RIGHT NOW, EUROPEAN NATIONS DON'T ALWAYS ALERT EACH OTHER  WHEN THEY TURN AWAY A SUSPECTED  EXTREMIST AT THE BORDER OR WHEN A PASSPORT IS STOLEN.  THEY HAVE TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE INTELLIGENCE SHARING AND COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION. AND WE'RE READY TO HELP THEM DO  THAT.  WE ALSO NEED TO TAKE DOWN THE  NETWORK OF ENABLERS WHO HELP   JIHADDISTS FINANCE AND FACILITATE THEIR TRAVEL, FORGE DOCUMENTS AND EVADE DETECTION. AND THE UNITED STATES AND OUR ALLIES SHOULD COMMIT TO REVOKE THE PASSPORTS AND VISAS OF   JIHADDISTS WHO HAVE GONE TO JOIN ISIS OR OTHER GROUPS AND BRING   THE FULL FORCE OF THE LAW  AGAINST THEM.  AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE, UNITED  STATES HAS TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT OUR VISA PROGRAMS AND I'M   GLAD THE ADMINISTRATION AND  CONGRESS ARE STEPPING UP   SCRUTINY IN THE WAKE OF SAN  BERNANDINO. AND THAT SHOULD INCLUDE SCRUTINIZING APPLICANTS' SOCIAL MEDIA POSTINGS.  WE ALSO SHOULD DISPATCH MORE   HOMELAND SECURITY AGENTS TO  HIGH-RISK COUNTRIES TO BETTER  INVESTIGATE VISA APPLICANTS. FOR MANY YEARS, AMERICA HAS  WAIVED VISA REQUIRKTSE WITH RELIABLE PROCEDURES, INCLUDING KEY ALLIES IN EUROPE AND ASIA. THAT MAKES SENSE, BUT WE ALSO  HAVE TO BE SMART. EXCEPT FOR LIMITED EXCEPTIONS LIKE DIPLOMATS AND AID WORKERS,  ANYONE WHO HAS TRAVELED IN THE   PAST FIVE YEARS TO A COUNTRY   FACING SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH   TERRORISM AND FOREIGN FIGHTERS SHOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH A FULL VISA INVESTIGATION NO MATTER   WHERE THEY'RE FROM. WE ALSO HAVE TO BE VIGILANT IN SCREENING AND VETTING REFUGEES FROM SYRIA, GUIDED BY THE BEST   JUDGMENT OF OUR SECURITY AND DIPLOMATIC PROFESSIONALS. RIGOROUS VETTING ALREADY TAKES PLACE WHILE REFUGEES ARE STILL OVERSEAS.  AND IT'S A PROCESS THAT  HISTORICALLY TAKES 18-24 MONTHS. BUT CONGRESS NEEDS TO PROVIDE  ENOUGH RESOURCES TO ENSURE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT PERSONNEL  DEPLOYED TO RUN THE MOST THOROUGH POSSIBLE PROCESS. AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY, WE CANNOT ALLOW TERRORISTS TO INTIMIDATE US INTO ABANDONNING   OUR VALUES AND OUR HUMANITARIAN OBLIGATIONS.   TURNING AWAY   ORPHANS, APPLYING A RELIGIOUS TEST THAT DISCRIMINATES AGAINST MUSLIMS, SLAMMING THE DOOR ON EVERY SINGLE SYRIAN REFUGEE,   THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE AS AMERICANS. WE ARE BETTER THAN THAT.   IT WOULD BE A COOL IRONY INDEED IF ISIS CAN FORCE   FAMILIES FROM THEIR HOMES AND ALSO PREVENT THEM FROM FINDING   NEW ONES.  SO AFTER RIGOROUS SCREENING, WE SHOULD WELCOME FAMILIES FLEEING SYRIA, JUST AS THE TWIN CITIES   AND THIS STATE HAVE WELCOMED   PREVIOUS GENERATIONS OF REFUGEES , EXILES AND IMMIGRANTS.   OF COURSE THE KEY  IS TO PREVENT TERRORISTS FROM EXPLOITING OUR COMPASSION AND  ENDANGERING OUR SECURITY, BUT WE CAN DO THIS. AND I THINK WE MUST. THIRD, WE HAVE TO DISCOVER AND DISRUPT JIHADDISTS' PLOTS BEFORE THEY CAN BE CARRIED OUT. THIS IS GOING TO TAKE BETTER   INTELLIGENCE, COLLECTION   ANALYSIS AND SHARING. I PROPOSED AN INTELLIGENCE SURGE AGAINST ISIS THAT INCLUDES MORE OPERATIONS OFFICERS ANDLING GIFT S. ENHANCING OUR SURVEILLANCE OF OVERSEAS' TARGETS, FLYING MORE   REPUBLIC CON ACEANCE MISSIONS TO TRACK TERRORIST MOVEMENTS AND DEVELOPING CLOSER PARTNERSHIPS   WITH OTHER INTELLIGENCE  SERVICES. PRESIDENT OBAMA RECENTLY SIGNED THE U.S.A. FREEDOM ACT WHICH WAS PASSED BY A BIPARTISAN MAJORITY  IN CONGRESS. IT PROPER JEBLINGTS CIVIL LIBERTIES WHILE MAINTAINING CAPABILITIES THAT OUR  INTELLIGENCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS NEED TO KEEP US SAFE. HOWEVER, THE NEW LAW IS UNDER ATTACK FROM PRESIDENTIAL   CANDIDATES ON THE LEFT AND   RIGHT. SOME WOULD STRIP AWAY  COUNTERTERRORISM TOOLS EVEN WITH APPROPRIATE JUDICIAL AND CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT AND  OTHERS SEEM TO GO BACK TO DISCREDITED PRACTICES OF THE   PAST.  I DON'T THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO LET EITHER VIEW PREVAIL. NOW, ENCRYPTION OF MOBILE DEVICES AND COMMUNICATIONS DOES  PRESENT A PARTICULARLY TOUGH PROBLEM WITH IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR SECURITY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND  COUNTERTERRORISM PROFESSIONALS   WARNED THAT IMPEN TRENABLE   ENCRYPTION MAY MAKE IT HARDER TO PREVENT FUTURE ATTACKS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE   VERY LEGITIMATE WORRIES ABOUT PRIVACY, NETWORK SECURITY AND CREATING NEW VULNERABILITIES THAT BAD ACTORS CAN EXPLOIT. I KNOW THERE IS NO MAGIC FIX TO THIS DILEMMA THAT WILL SATISFY   ALL THESE CONCERNS, BUT WE CAN'T JUST THROW UP OUR HANDS. THE TECH COMMUNITY AND THE   GOVERNMENT HAVE TO STOP SEEING EACH OTHER AS ADVERSE SEARS AND START WORKING TOGETHER TO KEEP   US SAFE FROM TERRORISTS. AND EVEN AS WE MAKE SURE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS GET THE  TOOLS THEY NEED TO PREVENT ATTACKS, IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE  ALSO MAKE SURE THAT JIHADDISTS DON'T GET THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO CARRY OUT ATTACKS. IT DEFIES COMMON SENSE THAT REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS REFUSE   TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR POTENTIAL TERRORISTS TO BUY GUNS.    IF YOU ARE TOO   DANGEROUS TO FLY, YOU ARE TOO DANGEROUS TO BUY A GUN. AND WE SHOULD INSIST --  [CHEERS  WE SHOULD INSIST ON COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS AND CLOSE LOOPHOLES THAT  ALLOW POTENTIAL TERRORISTS TO  BUY ONLINE OR AT GUN SHOWS AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS AND HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES!   I KNOW THAT THIS   WILL DRIVE SOME OF OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS A LITTLE CRAZY. YOU'LL PROBABLY HEAR IT TONIGHT. THEY WILL SAY THAT GUNS ARE A TOTALLY SEPARATE ISSUE.  I HAVE NEWS FOR THEM. TERRORISTS USE GUNS TO KILL AMERICANS AND I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE IT A LOT HARDER FOR THEM TO DO THAT EVER AGAIN!    AND THERE'S A QUESTION THEY SHOULD BE ASKED, WHY DON'T THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WANT TO DO THAT? YOU SEE, I HAVE THIS OLD-FASHIONED IDEA THAT WE ELECT A PRESIDENT IN PART, IN LARGE  PART, TO KEEP US SAFE FROM TERRORISTS, FROM GUN VIOLENCE, FROM WHATEVER THREATENS OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET THE GUN LOBBY OR ANYONE ELSE TELL ME THAT THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT PATH FOR US TO GO DOWN!    THE FOURTH ELEMENT IN MY STRATEGY IS SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO RISK  THEIR LIVES TO PREVENT AND   RESPOND TO TERRORIST ATTACKS.  IN SAN BERNANDINO, CITY, COUNTY, STATE AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ACTED WITH SPEED AND COURAGE TO PREVENT EVEN MORE LOSS OF LIFE. DETECTIVE LAZANO, A 15-YEAR POLICE VETERAN ASSURED TERRIFIED CIVILIANS, I'LL TAKE A BULLET BEFORE YOU DO. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE GRATITUDE WE OWE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS LIKE THAT DETECTIVE WHO RUN TOWARD  DANGER TO TRY TO SAVE LIVES. AND NOT JUST IN THE IMMEDIATE WAKE OF AN ATTACK, EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WILL KEEP PUTTING   THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE LONG   AFTER THE CAMERAS MOVE ON. IT IS DISGRACEFUL THAT CONGRESS  HAS FAILED TO KEEP FAITH WITH  FIRST RESPONDERS WHO ARE FEELING THE THE LASTING EFFECTS OF 9/11. MANY OF THEM WERE MEN AND WOMEN  I WAS SO PROUD TO REPRESENT AS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK. ADROGEA 9/11 HEALTH ACT. IT LOOKS LIKE MAJORITY LEADER  MCCONNELL MAY HAVE DROPPED HIS   OPPOSITION.  AND I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE   WILL HOLD HIM TO THAT AND WE   WILL CONTINUE TO HONOR THE   SERVICE AND SACRIFICE OF THOSE WHO RESPONDED TO THE WORST   TERRORIST ATTACK IN OUR HISTORY. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT LOCAL  LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS THE RESOURCES AND TRAINING THEY NEED TO KEEP US SAFE. AND THEY SHOULD BE MORE CLOSELY SYNCED WITH NATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM EXPERTS LIKE  FUSION CENTERS THAT SERVE AS   CLEARINGHOUSES FOR INTELLIGENCE  AND COORDINATION. AND WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR  DEFENSES AND WHEREVER WE ARE VULNERABLE WHETHER IT IS SHOPPING MALLS OR HIGHER PROFILE TARGETS LIKE RAILWAYS OR   AIRPORTS. WE HAVE TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IN   LOCKING DOWN LOOSE NUCLEAR   MATERIALS AND OTHER W.M.D. SO  THEY NEVER FALL INTO THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS WHO SEEK THEM ACTIVELY AROUND THE WORLD. SO WE CAN BE PROVIDING THE   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY  WITH THE RESOURCES IT NEEDS TO   STAY ONE STEP AHEAD, NOT TRYING TO PRIVATIZE KEY FUNCTIONS LIKE T.S.A., AS SOME REPUBLICANS HAVE PROPOSED. AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO   RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN BEING SURE THAT OUR FEDERAL AUTHORITIES SHARE  INFORMATION WITH OUR STATE AND   LOCAL AUTHORITIES, BUT THAT WAS  AN ISSUE I TACKLED AFTER 9/11, AND WE HAVE TO STAY REALLY   VIGILANT SO THAT INFORMATION IS  IN THE HANDS WHERE IT NEEDS TO   BE. FINALLY, THE FIFTH ELEMENT IN  THE STRATEGY IS EMPOWERING MUSLIM AMERICAN COMMUNITIES ON   ARE ON THE FRONT LININGS IN THE  FIGHT AGAINST RADICALIZATION. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEACE-LOVING AMERICAN MUSLIMS LIVING, WORKING, RAISING FAMILIES, PAYING TAXES IN OUR COUNTRY.   THESE AMERICANS MAY BE OUR FIRST, LAST AND BEST DEFENSE AGAINST HOME-GROWN RADICALIZATION AND TERRORISM. THEY ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO RECOGNIZE THE INSIDIOUS EFFECTS OF RADICALIZATION BEFORE IT'S  TOO LATE, INTERVENE TO HELP SET A YOUNG PERSON STRAIGHT. THEY ARE THE BEST POSITION TO  BLOCK ANYTHING GOING FORWARD. THAT'S WHY LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS WORKED SO HARD SINCE 9/11 TO BUILDUP TRUST AND STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN MUSLIM-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. HERE IN THE TWIN CITIES, YOU HAVE AN INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIP THAT BRINGS TOGETHER, PARENTS, TEACHERS, IMAMS WITH LAW   ENFORCEMENT, NONPROFITS, LOCAL BUSINESSES, MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND OTHERS, TO INTERVENE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WHO  ARE AT RISK. IT'S CALLED THE BUILDING COMMUNITY RESILIENCE PILOT   PROGRAM AND IT DESERVES INCREASED SUPPORT. IT HAS NOT GOTTEN THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAT IT NEEDS TO DO EVERYTHING THAT THE PEOPLE   INVOLVED IN IT KNOW THEY CAN DO  AND WE HAVE GOT TO DO A BETTER JOB OF SUPPORTING IT.    I KNOW THAT LIKE   MANY PLACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY   THERE IS MORE WORK TO DO TO INCREASE TRUST BETWEEN   COMMUNITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. JUST LAST MONTH, I KNOW HERE, ADOWN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN WAS FATALLY SHOT BY A POLICE OFFICER AND I UNDERSTAND AN  INVESTIGATION IS UNDER WAY.  WHATEVER THE OUTCOME, TRAGEDIES  LIKE THIS RAISE HARD QUESTIONS ABOUT RACIAL JUSTICE IN AMERICA AND PUT AT RISK EFFORTS TO BUILD THE COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIPS THAT HELP KEEP US SAFE FROM CRIME AND FROM TERRORISM.  WHEN PEOPLE SEE THAT RESPECT AND TRUST ARE TWO-WAY STREETS, THEY  ARE MORE LIKELY TO WORK HAND IN-IN HAND WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. ONE OF THE MOTHERS OF THE 10 MEN RECENTLY CHARGED WITH CONSPIRING , THE TERRORISTS SAID, WE HAVE   TO STOP THE DENIAL, SHE TOLD OTHER PARENTS THAT.  WE HAVE TO TALK TO OUR KIDS AND  WORK WITH THE F.B.I. THAT'S A MESSAGE WE NEED TO HEAR FROM LEADERS WITHIN  MUSLIM-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES  ACROSS OUR COUNTRY.  BUT WE ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE SUCCESSES IN MUSLIM-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES, AND THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM.  I JUST MET WITH THE FIRST  SOMALI-AMERICAN MEMBER OF THE CITY COUNCIL HERE --   HE WAS PROUDLY   TELLING ME HOW MUCH CHANGE SOMALI IMMIGRANTS, NOW   MUSLIM-AMERICANS HAVE MADE IN  PARTS OF THE CITY AND  NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE BEEN PRETTY MUCH HALLOWED OUT.  LET'S LOOK AT THE SUCCESSES. IF WE ARE GOING TO FULLY   INTEGRATE EVERYONE IN AMERICA, WE NEED TO BE SEEING ALL THEIR CHIROPRACTICS, TOO.  AND THAT IS ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WHY WE MUST ALL STAND UP AGAINST OFFENSIVE, INFLAMMATORY, HATEFUL ANTI--MUSLIM RHETORIC. [CHEERS AND  YOU KNOW, NOT ONLY DO THESE COMMENTS CUT AGAINST EVERYTHING WE STAND FOR AS AMERICANS, THEY ARE ALSO DANGEROUS. AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE F.B.I.  TOLD CONGRESS RECENTLY, ANYTHING THAT ERODES TRUST WITH MUSLIM-AMERICANS MAKES THE JOB OF LAW ENFORCEMENT MORE DIFFICULT. WE NEED EVERY COMMUNITY INVESTED IN THIS FIGHT, NOT ALIENATED AND SITTING ON THE SIDELINES. ONE OF THE COMMUNITY LEADERS I   MET WITH TOLD ME THAT A LOT OF THE CHILDREN IN THE COMMUNITY  ARE NOW AFRAID TO GO TO SCHOOL.  THEY'RE NOT ONLY AFRAID OF BEING PERCEIVED AS A THREAT, THEY ARE AFRAID OF BEING THREATENED   BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE. THIS IS SUCH A OPEN-HEARTED AND  GENEROUS COMMUNITY, I HOPE THERE WILL BE EVEN MORE EFFORTS  PERHAPS UNDER THE EGIS OF THE  UNIVERSITY AND GOVERNOR DAYTON AND OTHERS TO BRING PEOPLE   TOGETHER TO REASSURE MEMBERS OF  THE COMMUNITY, PARTICULARLY CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS THAT THEY ARE WELCOME, INVITED AND VALUED HERE IN THIS CITY AND STATE.   NOW DODGED TRUMP'S PROPOSAL TO BAN ALL MUSLIMS FROM ENTERING THE UNITED STATES HAS RIGHTLY SPARKED OUTRAGE ACROSS OUR COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD, EVEN SOME OF THE OTHER  REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES ARE SAYING HE'S GONE TOO FAR. BUT THE TRUTH IS, MANY OF THOSE SAME CANDIDATES HAVE ALSO SAID, DISGRACEFUL THINGS ABOUT   MUSLIMS. AND THIS KIND OF DIVISIVE RHETORIC ACTUALLY PLAYS INTO THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS. IT ALIENATES PARTNERS AND UNDERMINES MODERATES.  WE NEED AROUND THE WORLD IN THIS FIGHT AGAINST ISIS. YOU KNOW, YOU HEAR A LOT OF TALK FROM SOME OF THE OTHER   CANDIDATES ABOUT COALITIONS. EVERYONE SEEMS TO WANT ONE.    BUT THERE ISN'T NEARLY AS MUCH TALK AS IT IS TO  BUILD A COALITION AND MAKE IT  WORK.  I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS. INSULATING POTENTIAL ALLIES  DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER.    -- INSULTING POTENTIAL ALLIES  DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER.  [CHEERS AND  DEMONIZING MUSLIMS MAKES IT THAT MUCH HARDER. THE UNITED STATES IS AT WAR WITH ISLAM. AS BOTH THE PENTAGON AND THE   F.B.I. HAVE SAID IN THE PAST WEEK, WE CANNOT IN ANY WAY LEND CREDENCE TO THAT TWISTED IDEA. THIS IS NOT A CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS. THIS IS A CLASH BETWEEN  CIVILIZATIONS AND BARBARISM AND THAT'S HOW IT MUST BE SEEN AND FOUGHT.    SOME WILL TELL YOU THAT OUR OPEN SOCIETY IS A   VULNERABILITY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM. I DISAGREE.  I BELIEVE OUR TOLERANCE AND  DIVERSITY ARE AT THE COR OF OUR  STRENGTHS. AT A NATIONAL TRALIZATION  CEREMONY FOR NEW CITIZENS TODAY  IN WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT OBAMA NOTED THE TENSION THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY BETWEEN WELCOMING OR   REJECTING THE STRANGER, IT IS, HE SAID, ABOUT THE MEANING OF AMERICA, WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY DO WE WANT TO BE. AND IT'S ABOUT THE CAPACITY OF EACH GENERATION TO HONOR THE CREED AS OLD AS OUR FOUNDING,  OUT OF MANY, WE ARE ONE. PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RIGHT. AND IT MATTERS. IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT AMERICAN MUSLIMS HAVE LONG BEEN BETTER INTEGRATED AND LESS   SUSCEPTIBLE TO RADICALIZATION THAN MUSLIMS IN LESS WELCOMING NATIONS. AND WE CANNOT GIVE IN TO DEMA  GOG WHO PLAY ON OUR BASIC INSTINCTS AND RELY ON THE  PRINCIPLES WRITTEN INTO OUR AMERICAN D.N.A., FREEDOM,  EQUALITY, OPPORTUNITY. AMERICA IS STRONGEST WHEN ALL  OUR PEOPLE BELIEVE THEY HAVE A   STAKE IN OUR COUNTRY AND OUR   FUTURE, NO MATTER WHERE THEY'RE FROM, WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE, WHO THEY WORSHIP OR WHO THEY LOVE. OUR COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED BY PEOPLE FLEEING RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION. AS GEORGE WASHINGTON PUT IT. THE UNITED STATES GIVES TO BIGOTRY NO SANCTIONS, TO PERSECUTION, NO ASSISTANCE. SO TO ALL OF OUR MUSLIM AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS, THIS IS YOUR COUNTRY, TOO. AND I'M PROUD TO BE YOUR FELLOW AMERICAN.    AND I WANT TO REMIND US, PARTICULARLY OUR  REPUBLICAN FRIENDS THAT GEORGE BUSH WAS RIGHT. SIX DAYS AFTER 9/11, HE WENT TO A MUSLIM COMMUNITY CENTER AND  HERE'S WHAT HE SAID. THOSE WHO FEEL LIKE THEY CAN INTIMIDATE OUR FELLOW CITIZENS TO TAKE OUT THEIR ANGER DON'T REPRESENT THE BEST OF AMERICA, THEY REPRESENT THE WORST OF HUMANKIND AND THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR.   SO IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE BEST   OF AMERICA, YOU NEED LOOK NO   FURTHER THAN ARMY CAPTAIN KHAN. HE WAS BORN IN THE UNITED ARAB   EMIRATES AND MOVED TO MARYLAND   AS A SMALL CHILD. HE LATER GRADUATED FROM THE  UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA BEFORE ENLISTING IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY. IN JUNE, 2004, HE WAS SERVING IN IRAQ. ONE DAY WHILE HIS INFANTRY UNIT WAS GUARDING THE GATES OF THEIR BASE, A SUSPICIOUS VEHICLE   APPEARED. CAPTAIN KHAN TOLD HIS TROOPS TO  GET BACK, BUT HE WENT FORWARD. HE TOOK 10 STEPS TOWARDS THE CAR BEFORE IT EXPLODED.  CAPTAIN KHAN WAS KILLED, BUT HIS UNIT WAS SAVED BY HIS COURAGEOUS ACT. CAPTAIN KHAN WAS AWARDED THE   BRONZE STAR AND PURPLE HEART.  HE WAS JUST 27 YEARS OLD. WE STILL WONDER WHAT MADE HIM  TAKE THOSE 10 STEPS, KHAN'S  FATHER SAID IN A RECENT  INTERVIEW. MAYBE THAT'S THE POINT HE WENT   ON, WHERE ALL THE VALUES, ALL  THE SERVICE TO COUNTRY, ALL THE  THINGS HE LEARNED IN THIS COUNTRY KICKED IN. IT WAS THOSE VALUES THAT MADE  HIM TAKE THOSE 10 STEPS, THOSE 10 STEPS TOLD US WE DID NOT MAKE A MISTAKE IN MOVING TO THIS COUNTRY, HIS FATHER FINISHED. AS HARD AS THIS IS, IT IS TIME TO MOVE FROM FEAR TO RESOLVE.  IT'S TIME TO STAND UP AND SAY WE ARE AMERICANS. WE ARE THE GREATEST NATION ON  EARTH, NOT IN SPITE OF THE   CHALLENGES WE FACE, BUT BECAUSE  OF THEM. AMERICANS WILL NOT BUCKLE OR   BREAK. WE WILL NOT TURN ON EACH OTHER   OR TURN ON OUR PRINCIPLES. WE WILL PURSUE OUR ENEMIES WITH UNYIELDING POWER AND PURPOSE. WE WILL CRUSH THEIR WOULD-BE CALIPHATE AND ENCOUNTER RADICAL  JIHADISM WHEREVER IT TAX ROOT. WE ARE IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL   AND WE WILL STAND TALLER AND STRONGER.  THAT'S WHAT WE DO HERE.  THAT'S WHO WE ARE. THAT'S HOW WE WILL WIN, BY LOOKING AT ONE ANOTHER WITH RESPECT, WITH CONCERN, WITH  COMMITMENT. THAT'S THE AMERICA THAT I KNOW   MAKES US ALL SO PROUD TO BE A PART OF. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.   THANK YOU. THANK YOU.   CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE  NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE,   WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS   CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY.

I AM SO EXCITED TO BE HERE AND TO HAVE THIS CHANCE TO STAND ON THE SAME STAGE WITH MY FRIENDS AND FORMER COLLEAGUES. AREN'T THEY AN AMAZING GROUP?   >> I WAS EXCITED WHEN BARBARA MIKULSKI GOT THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL, THAT FREEDOM -- THE MEDAL OF FREEDOM, WELL-DESERVED. I'M SO GRATEFUL TO HER FOR HER LEADERSHIP. SHE IS THE SENATOR WHO MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME TO WEAR PANTS ON THE SENATE FLOOR, AND AMONG HER MANY, MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS, SHE SAID SHE IS RETIRING, BUT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A WORD THAT APPLIES TO BARBARA MIKULSKI. ANOTHER PERSON TO WHOM THE WORD RETIRING DOESN'T FIT IS BARBARA BOXER WHO ALSO ANNOUNCED SHE IS RETIRING. THESE TWO ARE AN AMAZING EXAMPLE OF FORTITUDE AND LEADERSHIP ON SO MANY IMPORTANT ISSUES. THE SENATE'S GOING TO MISS THEM, BUT I'M SURE, AS I HEARD SENATOR MIKULSKI SAY, THEY'RE GOING TO TURN PAGES AND HAVE NEW CHAPTERS THEY'LL WRITE. I THINK HE SHOULD SHOW OUR APPRECIATION TO THEM FOR THEIR YEARS OF SERVICE ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTRY.   >> I LITERALLY COULD KEEP YOU HERE FOR MANY HOURS TALKING ABOUT THESE AMAZING WOMEN. I WON'T DO THAT BUT I WANT TO THANK EACH ONE OF THEM. WANT TO TANK TAMMY AND MARIA, DIANE, KIRSTIN, HIDY, MAIZEY, AMY, CLAIRE, PATTY, JEANIE, AND DEBBIE. AND ALSO SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IS MY FORMER COLLEAGUE, MARY LAN -- LANDRIEU AND DOROTHY McAULIFFE SO ALL IN ALL THIS IS AN AMAZINGLY DISTINGUISHED GROUP. LITERALLY THEY HAVE SO MUCH COURAGE AND SMARTS. A COMBINATION OF GRIT AND GRACE THAT APPLIES TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. I IT WAS REALLY THE HONOR AND PRIVILEGE OF MY LIFE TO SERVE WITH THEM AND TO LEARN SO MUCH FROM THEM. NOW, THE SENATE WILL BE IN GOOD HANDS WHEN, UNFORTUNATELY, THE TWO BARBARAS LEAVE, BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE EXTRAORDINARY SENATORS STILL SERVING, AND I FOR ONE WILL REALLY BE COUNTING ON THEM BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PUT OUR COUNTRY ON THE RIGHT TRACK, AND I AM HOPING THAT BECAUSE OF THE ELECTION NEXT YEAR, THIS TIME WE'LL BE ABLE TO CELEBRATE MORE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS AND MAYBE EVEN HAVE TAKEN THE MAJORITY OF THE SENATE BACK.   >> NOW, I'M SO EXCITED TO SEE ALL OF YOU HERE BECAUSE I NEED YOUR SUPPORT. I NEED YOUR GENEROSITY, BUT MORE THAN THAT I NEED YOUR HOURS OF VOLUNTEERING AND CANVASSING AND REACHING OUT TO EVERYBODY YOU CAN POSSIBLY TOUCH. BECAUSE THIS ELECTION IS SO CONSEQUENTIAL. I THINK ABOUT IT AND THERE COULD NOT BE TWO MORE DIFFERENT VIEWS, VISIONS, AND SET OF VALUES, BETWEEN WHAT WE HEAR FROM THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO LAY OUT AS THE AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE. THE KIND OF FUTURE THAT WILL GET OUR ECONOMY WORKING FOR EVERYBODY, ENABLE MORE PEOPLE TO FULFILL THEIR POTENTIAL, CONTINUE AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD. WE HEAR A LOT OF NEGATIVITY AND IDEOLOGY COMING FROM THE CANDIDATES ON THE OTHER SIDE. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TRY TO PIERCE THAT WITH SOME GOOD OLD-FASHIONED FACTS. LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE -- I KNOW MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS REALLY HATE IT WHEN I SAY THIS -- OUR ECONOMY DOES BETTER WHEN WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE.   >> THE EVIDENCE IS PRETTY OVERWHELMING. UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOWER, INCOMES ARE HIGHER, AND YOU ARE FOUR TIME MOWS LIKELY TO HAVE A RECESSION WHEN WE HAVE A REPUBLICAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK IN OUR HISTORY TO PROVE THAT. JUST GO BACK THE LAST 35 YEARS. WE HAVE HAD FIVE PRESIDENTS. THREE REPUBLICANS AND TWO DEMOCRATS. I HAPPEN TO KNOW BOTH OF THE DEMOCRATS. AND EACH OF THEM INHERITED ECONOMIC PROBLEMS FROM THEIR REPUBLICAN PREDECESSORS. IN MY HUSBAND'S CASE IT WAS RECESSION. AND THE FACT THAT OUR NATIONAL DEBT HAD BEEN QUADRUPLED IN THE PRIOR 12 YEARS. I REMEMBER HIM SAYING TO ME SHORTLY AFTER THE ELECTION, IT IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN THEY TOLD US. AND THEN HE WAS ASKED BY SOMEBODY, WHAT IS IT YOU'RE RINGING TO WASHINGTON HE THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE AND SAID, WELL, PROBABLY ARITHEMATIC. SO HE GOT TO WORK AND AFTER EIGHT YEARS, WE HAD 23 MILLION NEW JOBS, INCOMES WENT UP FOR EVERYBODY, NOT JUST AT THE TOP. IN THE MIDDLE. WORKING PEOPLE, POOR PEOPLE. MORE PEOPLE LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY THAN AT ANY TIME IN RECENT HISTORY, AND WE ENDED UP WITH A BALANCED BUDGET AND A SURPLUS. NOW, YOU WOULD THINK THE EVIDENCE WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT WAS AN ECONOMIC POLICY THAT ACTUALLY WORKED FOR EVERYBODY, BUT BACK CAME THE REPUBLICANS WITH THEIR IDEOLOGY, TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS, AND THEY BEGAN TO JUST DISMANTLE IT, BRICK-BY-BRICK, CUT TAXES ON THE WEALTHY, THEN THEY TOOK THEIR EYES OFF OF CORPORATIONS AND THE FINANCIAL MARKET, THE MORTGAGE MARKET, AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. NOW, SHORTLY AFTER THE '08 ELECTION, PRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA CALLED ME, ASKED ME TO SEE HIM IN CHICAGO. I DIDN'T KNOW WHY. TURNED OUT HE WANTED ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT AT THE TIME. SO IT'S JUST HE AND I WERE SITTING THERE, AND HE SAYS, IT IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN THEY TOLD US. I SAID, YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT-ELECT, I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE. BUT IT WAS TERRIBLE. I MEAN, WE WERE LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH. BEFORE IT WAS OVER, NINE MILLION AMERICANS LOST THEIR JOBS. FIVE MILLION LOST THEIR HOMES. $13 TRILLION IN FAMILY WEALTH WAS WIPED OUT. NOW, I DON'T THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA GETS THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR DIGGING US OUT OF THE BIG DITCH HE INHERITED FROM THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEPRESSION. AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WORKED SO HARD. YOU KNOW THE SACRIFICE THAT A LOT OF FOLKS MADE. SO, WE ARE STANDING AGAIN, WE RECOVERED 13 MILLION JOBS, BUT WE'RE NOT YET RUNNING THE WAY AMERICA SHOULD. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE ECONOMY IS PRODUCING MORE GOOD-PAYING JOBS, AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT INCOMES ARE RISING AGAIN. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVEN'T REALLY HAD A RAISE IN A LONG TIME. NOW, FOLKS AT THE TOP ARE DOING JUST FINE. BUT MOST PEOPLE, THEY'RE STILL STRUGGLING. THE COST OF CHILD CARE OR COLLEGE OR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, THEY'RE GOING OPIFICER THAN WAGES.  -- FASTER THAN WAGES. SO WE HAVE TO GET THE ECONOMY BACK WORKING FOR EVERYBODY TO CREATE BROAD-BASED PROSPERITY AGAIN, AND I'VE BEEN LAYING OUT PLANS. I'M DETERMINED, I'M JUST GOING TO KEEP TELLING PEOPLE WHAT I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT, AND SO I HAVE BEEN LAYING ANOTHER PLANS HOW TO CREATE MORE GOOD-PAYING JOBS ITCH ROLLED OUT MY PLAN FOR BUILDING AND MAINTAINING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU KNOW, OUR ROADS, OUR BRIDGES, OUR TUNNELS, OUR PORTS, OUR AIRPORTS, OUR RAIL SYSTEM, AND DON'T FORGET OUR VIRTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE, BY 2020, EVERYBODY IN AMERICA SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY, AFFORDABLE BROADBAND THAT CONNECTS THEM TO THE REST OF THE WORLD NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE.   >> I ALSO THINK WE CAN CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOB I WAS WE GET SERIOUS ABOUT COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE, AND I GIVE THE PRESIDENT GREAT CREDIT FOR BEING OVER IN PARIS, LEADING ON THIS ISSUE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE REPUBLICANS SAY WHEN THEY'RE ASKED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. THEY SAY, WELL, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST. MY RESPONSE IS, GO TALK TO ONE. THERE ARE LOTS OF THEM AROUND. WE KNOW SOME, DON'T WE. WE COULD INTRODUCE YOU. IT'S MADDENING, THIS DENIAL OF SCIENCE, AND IT'S NOT ONLY TERRIBLE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN, IT'S BAD FOR THE ECONOMY. I WANT TO SET SOME BIG GOALS. BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM I WANT US TO HAVE INSTALLED A HALF A BILLION MORE SOLAR PANELS AND BY THE END OF MY SECOND, ANOTHER CLEAN ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME IN AMERICA.   >> I'M ALSO REALLY FOCUSED ON DOING MORE FOR SMALL BUSINESS. I WANT TO BE THE SMALL BUSINESS PRESIDENT BECAUSE 60% OF OUR NEW JOBS WILL COME FROM SMALL BUSINESS, AND RIGHT NOW, WE'RE NOT SEEING THE GROWTH THAT WE NEED. DID YOU KNOW IT'S NOW EASIER TO START A SMALL BUSINESS IN CANADA OR FRANCE THAN IT IS IN THE UNITED STATES? WE HAVE SOME GREAT CHAMPIONS OF SMALL BUSINESS ON THIS STAGE. I WANT TO WORK WITH THEM AND WITH OTHERS TO CLEAR OUT THE BRUSH, TO GET THE CREDIT FLOWING AGAIN TO GET MORE PEOPLE WITH THOSE GOOD IDEAS A CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO START AND GROW A BUSINESS. MY DAD WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN, AND I DEEPLY RESPECT THAT ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO TACKLE THE TAX CODE WITH ALL OF ITS INEFFICIENCIES AND ALL OF IT UNFAIRNESS. I KNOW WHAT A BIG UNDERTAKE CAN THAT IS, BUT RIGHT NOW, IT'S REALLY STACKED IN FAVOR OF THE WEALTHY. ALL OF THE LOOPHOLES, THE DEDUCTIONS, WHATEVER IT IS THAT ENABLES SOMEBODY TO ESCAPE PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE, THE WEALTHY PAY TOO LITTLE AND THE MIDDLE CLASS PAYS TOO MUCH AND I HAVE SAID, I THINK THE MIDDLE CLASS DESERVES A RAISE, NOT A TAX INCREASE, AND I WILL NOT RAISE TAXES ON MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GET BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE THEY FELL INTO THAT DITCH OF THE GREAT RECESSION.   >> BUT YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT RAISING INCOME, YOU KNOW THE FASTEST, SUREST WAY OF DOING? IT'S TO MAKE SURE WOMEN GET EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK.   >> I HEARD BARBARA MIKULSKI TALKING ABOUT THE PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO GET THAT PASSED BECAUSE THIS IS STILL A REAL PROBLEM. NOW, IT'S NOT A IF YOU LISTEN TO THE REPUBLICANS, BUT I ACTUALLY MEET REAL PEOPLE. I'VE ACTUALLY HAD SOME REAL CONVERSATIONS. I'LL TELL YOU ONE OF THEM. A YOUNG MAN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SAID TO ME, I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY I'M FOR YOU. I SAID WHY? HE SAID BECAUSE MY FIRST REAL JOB -- HE CALLED IT MY FIRST REAL JOB -- I WENT TO WORK AS A CASHIER IN THE STORE WHERE MY MOTHER HAD BEEN WORKING FOUR YEARS. HE SAID I WAS REALLY EXCITED. THIS WAS IT. LIKE AN ADULT THING I WAS DOING. HE SAID I WORKED THERE, THEN I GOT MY FIRST PAYCHECK AND TOOK IT HOME AND SHOWED MY MOM AND I WATCHED HER FAIRS FALL, AND I ASKED HER WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. AND SHE SAID, YOU HAVE BEEN THERE FOR TWO WEEKS, YOU'RE MAKING MORE THAN I MAKE. I'VE BEEN THERE FOUR YEARS. AND I SAID, WHAT? WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THAT? HE SAID, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE KEEP THEIR EYE OUT FOR YOUNG, PROMISING MEN THEY MIGHT PUT INTO MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. HE SAID THEY PAY THEM MORE TO TRY TO KEEP THEM. AND HIS MOM, WHO HAD BEEN WORKING TO SUPPORT HIM ALL THOSE YEARS, WAS BEING SHORT-CHANGED. BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO HAVE EQUAL PAY. WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT SO FAMILIESENING BALANCE WORK AND FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES ISSUE PAID FAMILY LEAD, PAID SICK DAYS, CARE-GIVING CREDIT FOR PEOPLE WHO DESERVE IT, TO TAKE CARE OF A LOVED ONE. WE HAVE TO START LOOKING AT WHAT PEOPLE ARE LIVING LIKE TODAY. IT IS NOT 1955. IT'S 2015. WE NEED TO DO MORE TO LIFT UP THE OPPORTUNITY LADDERS THAT HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN OR BROKEN UP. AND I BELIEVE SO STRONGLY THAT IF WE GIVE WOMEN AN EQUAL CHANCE TO COMPETE, IT'S NOT ONLY GOOD FOR THEM, AND THEIR FAMILIES, IT'S GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY, IT'S A GROWTH STRATEGY. AND SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS PART OF THE GROWTH STRATEGY IS EDUCATION. I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE SURE K THROUGH 12 EDUCATION IS THE BEST WE CAN OFFER TO OUR KIDS. AND I BELIEVE THE PLACE TO START IS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION.   >> 80% OF YOUR BRAIN IS PHYSICALLY FORMED BY THE AGE OF THREE. IT REALLY MATTERS WHAT HAPPENS IN THOSE EARLY YEARS. AND WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE I THINK TALENT IS UNIVERSAL BUT OPPORTUNITY ISN'T, AND THERE ARE TOO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE BEHIND THE FIRST DAY THEY WALK INTO KINDERGARTEN. THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AGAIN AND I HAVE ROLLED OUT MY NEW COLLEGE COMPACT TO DO THAT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BORROW A DIME TO PAY TUITION IF YOU GO TO A PUBLIC FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE WILL BE FREE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO START THINKING THOSE OF TWO ADDITIONAL YEARS AS THE EXTENSION OF WHAT HIGH SCHOOL USED TO BE.   >> AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK TO MAKE SURE WE HELP PEOPLE PAY DOWN THEIR STUDENT DEBT. RIGHT NOW $1.2 TRILLION IN STUDENT DEBT. IT'S JUST CRIPPLING DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS. IT'S PREVENTING YOUNG PEOPLE FROM GETTING THE JOBS THEY WANT OR EVEN GETTING MARRIED, AND EVERYWHERE I GO I ASK HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE OR EVER HAVE HAD STUDENT DEBT. HANDS ALWAYS GO UP. WE CAN SAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE MAKING MONEY OFF OF LENDING MONEY TO OUR STUDENTS TO GET THEIR EDUCATION.   >> WE NEED TO IMPROVE IT, WHICH I WILL DO MY BEST TO DO, WORKING WITH THE CONGRESS. BUT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED TO REPEAL IT MORE THAN 50 TIMES. THEY WANT TO THROW US BACH INTO THAT TERRIBLE CONTENTIOUS DEBATE. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING SINCE HARRY TRUMAN TO HAVE A FOUNDATION TO PROVIDE QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. WE HAVE TO GET THE OUT OFT OF POCKET COSTS, PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS DOWN, ABOUT THAT IS BUILT ON THE BASE OF HAVING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS WENT UP 12% LAST YEAR. THIS IS JUST UNSUSTAINABLE. AND I KNOW IT'S HARD BECAUSE I'VE GOT THE SCARS TO PROVE IT. WE HAVE GOT TO GET THOSE COSTS IN SOME WAY CONTROLLED, OTHERWISE IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE, WHETHER THEY'RE IN MEDICARE OR MEDICAID OR PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR ONE OF THE EXCHANGES, TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE DRUGS AND TREATMENTS THEY DESERVE, AND WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT LIKE CRAZY TO GIVE MEDICARE THE AUTHORITY TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE DRUG COMPANIES SOMETHING THE DRUG COMPANIES DO WITH GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD.   >> THREE QUICK THINGS. ON HEALTH, NUMBER ONE, WE DO NEED TO DEAL WITH THE CARE-GIVING CRISIS. PEOPLE EVERYWHERE WHO ARE HAVING SO MANY CHALLENGES AND THERE'S TWO WAYS OF DOING IT. I WANT TO GIVE A TAX CREDIT TO PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF SOMEONE WITH ALZHEIMER'S OR SOME OTHER CONDITION THAT IS DEBILITATING BUT THE FAMILY WANTS TO BE ABLE TO CARE FOR THEIR LOVED ONE. I ALSO THINK WE HAVE TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO UNTREATED MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. SOMETHING THAT --   >> THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE PART OF THIS EXPERIENCE OF RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. MAYBE IT'S JUST ME BUT I THINK PROBABLY ALL MY FRIENDS COULD TELL YOU SIMILAR STORIES, MAYBE BECAUSE WE'RE WOMEN. I DON'T KNOW. PEOPLE TELL YOU THE MOST INTIMATE AND PERSONAL THINGS. IT MAY ONLY BE A HANDSHAKE, 30 SECONDS OR A MINUTE, AND THEY'LL LOOK AT YOU AND SAY, MY SON HAS A DRUG PROBLEM. AND WE CAN'T FIND ANY HELP. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU KNOW TO DO? OR MY BROTHER HAS BEEN SUFFERING FROM SCHIZOPHRENIA, WE CAN'T AFFORD ANY HELP. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO? IF YOU LISTEN TO ENOUGH STORIES LIKE THAT, PARTICULARLY ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE, YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DO MORE. AND IT'S GOING TO BE A HIGH PRIORITY TO TRY TO GET THE RESOURCES IN BALANCE WITH THE PROBLEMS SO THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH TREATMENT, RECOVERY PROGRAMS, PREVENTION, INTERVENTION, AND AGAIN, SOMETHING THAT I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND TALKING THROUGH POLICIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THE RIGHT MIX, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO JUST BE THE PRESIDENT TO DEAL WITH THE BIG PROBLEMS IN THE HEADLINES, ALTHOUGH OBVIOUS LIVE THAT'S A HUGE PART OF THE JOB. I WANT TO ALSO FIGURE OUT IF THERE ARE WAYS WE CAN HELP WITH THOSE PROBLEMS THAT KEEP YOU UP AT NIGHT. THE WORRIES THAT FAMILIES SIT AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE AND TRY TO PUZZLE THROUGH. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO, BUT I'LL TELL YOU WE ALSO HAVE TO DEFEND THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR COUNTRY IS MOVING FORWARD AND PROTECTING AND RECOGNIZING THE RIGHTS OF ALL OF OUR CITIZENS. AND I HAVE LEARNED IN MY YEARS IN POLITICS TO LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE SAY WHEN THEY RUN FOR OFFICE BECAUSE THEY MAY ACTUALLY TRY TO DO IT. SO WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THE ATTACKS ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND GAY RIGHTS AND IMMIGRANT RIGHTS AND WORKERS RIGHTS, PAY ATTENTION. AND I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, I WILL DEFEND A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE, I WILL DEFEND PLANNED PARENTHOOD.     >> WHAT WE SAW IN COLORADO SPRINGS THE OTHER NIGHT WAS JUST HORRIFIC. AND WE HAVE TO STAND UP FOR THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN TO GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED. AND WE HAVE STRONG, STRONG SOLDIERS AND FIGHTERS IN PURSUIT OF THAT BEHIND ME. I WILL ALSO DEFEND MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND WORK AGAINST CONTINUING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY. IT MAKES NO SENSE. YOU CAN GET MARRIED ON SATURDAY AND FIRED ON MONDAY IN A LOT OF PLACES IN AMERICA. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THAT. I WILL ALSO DEFEND VOTING RIGHTS. WHO KNEW WE WOULD SYSTEM HAVE TO BE DEFENDING VOTING RIGHTS IN THE 21st CENTURY, BUT BECAUSE OF THE SUPREME COURT'S REJECTION OF THE CONGRESS' REAUTHORIZATION AND GEORGE W. BUSH'S SIGNING OF THAT REAUTHORIZATION, SO MANY STATES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY ARE TRYING TO UNDERMINE VOTING RIGHTS. TRYING TO SUPPRESS THE RIGHT TO VOTE. NOT ONLY WILL WE DEFEND THOSE WHO ARE PUT INTO THAT DIFFICULT POSITION, I WANT TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR EVERY 18-YEAR-OLD TO BE ABSOLUTELY REGISTERED UPON TURNING 18, AND TO MAKE THAT THE LAW OF THE LAND UNLESS THEY OPT OUT, SO YOUNG PEOPLE START GETTING INVOLVED IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO OVERTURN CITIZEN IS UNITED, WHICH IS CORRUPTING OUR POLITICS.   >> IT'S LIKE THROUGH THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL HAVE ONE TO THREE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE APPOINTMENTS. AND I WILL APPOINT PEOPLE WHO CARE MORE ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAN A CORPORATION'S RIGHT TO BUY AN ELECTION.   >> I WILL ALSO DEFEND SOCIAL SECURITY AGAINST PRIVATIZATION, DEFEND MEDICARE AGAINST VOUCHERRIZATION, AND DEFEND THE VA. YES, WE HAVE TO REFORM AND IT CHANGE THE PROBLEM BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THE REPUBLICANS PRIVATIZE THE VA AND MOVE AWAY FROM PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES FOR OUR VETS. I WILL KEEP WORKING FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP. I WILL WORK IN PROMOTING CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND CORRECTIONS RIOT -- AND CORRECTS REFORM AND I HOPE WE GET SOME BIPARTISAN SUGARSES BEFORE THE END OF THIS TERM AND I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT AGAINST THE GUN LOBBY ON BEHALF OF GUN SAFETY MEASURES IN AMERICA. NOW, --   >> YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE 90 PEOPLE A DAY DYING FROM GUN VIOLENCE, HOMICIDE, SUICIDE, TRAGIC, AVOIDABLE ACCIDENTS, 33,000 PEOPLE A YEAR. IF SOMETHING ELSE WERE KILLING 33,000 AMERICANS WE'D SAY, HEY, WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO ARE COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS, CLOSING THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE, THE ONLINE LOOPHOLE, THE CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE, ENDING THE IMMUNITY FOR GUNMAKERS AND SELLERS. BUT WE KNOW HOW HARD THIS IS. LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. THERE'S A BILL THAT IS BOTTLED UP THAT WOULD PROHIBIT INDIVIDUALS ON THE NO-FLY LIST FROM BUYING A WEAPON. REPUBLICANS WON'T LET IT COME FOR A VOTE. YOU WOULD THINK IF SOMEONE IS TOO DANGEROUS TO FLY, THEY'RE TOO DANGEROUS TO BUY A GUN. AND AT THE VERY LEAST, WE SHOULD TRY TO RESTRAIN THAT FROM HAPPENING. SO WE HAVE WORK TO DO. AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LEAD AROUND THE WORLD. I AM VERY COMMITTED TO LEADING WITH OUR VALUES, ADVANCING OUR INTERESTS, FURTHERING OUR SECURITY, AND I INTEND TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT LEADS WITH BOTH STRENGTH AND SMARTS. BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SOME REAL CHALLENGES AND THREATS OUT THERE WE CAN'T IGNORE. LOTS OF ATTENTION BEING PAID TO ISIS, IT NEEDS TO BE DEFEATED. IT HAS TO BE WIPED OUT. THAT WILL TAKE TIME AND IT WILL TAKE AMERICAN LEADERSHIP. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CANNOT IGNORE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE PUT AMERICAN TROOPS IN EITHER SYRIA OR IRAQ. I'M AGAINST THAT. AND THE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE PROMOTING IT ARE NOT SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND HOW BEST TO TRY TO LIMIT THE SPREAD OF THIS RADICAL JIHADDIST VIOLENT EXTREMISM. SO THERE'S A LOT TO DO, MY FRIEND, AND I CAN ONLY HOPE YOU WILL WORK HARD WITH ME THROUGH THE PRIMARIES AND THE CAUCUSES, INTO THE GENERAL ELECTION, BECAUSE IT'S GOING BE A HARD JOURNEY. THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE SO MUCH IS AT STAKE. IT'S SORT OF PERVERSELY FLATTERING I GET SO MUCH ATTENTION FROM THE OTHER SIDE. I'VE LISTENED TO THEIR DEBATES AND IT SEEMED LIKE THEY HAD A LOT TO SAY ABOUT ME BEING SECRETARY OF STATE. NONE OF IT GOOD. SO I SENT THEM ALL A COPY OF MY BOOK ""HARD CHOICES"" AND I SAID, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW TO PUT TOGETHER AN INTERNATIONAL COALITION, INCLUDING CHINA AND RICH, TO IMPOSE CRIPPLING SANCTIONS ON IRAN, YOU CAN READ ABOUT IT. OR MAYBE YOU WANT TO NEGOTIATE A CEASE FIRE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS WITH THE MUSLIM BROTHER BROTHERHOOD, MORSIS' IN CAIRO. THAT'S THERE TOO. I SUGGESTED THERE WERE SO MANY OF THEM THEY COULD FORM A BOOK CLUB AND READ IT TOGETHER.   >> PROBABLY WON'T SURPRISE YOU TO HEAR I DIDN'T GET ONE THANK YOU NOTE. BUT FINALLY, THIS ELECTION IS REALLY FOR ME ABOUT OUR CHILDREN AND NOW I CAN SAY GRANDCHILDREN. AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE I WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE PROMISE OF OUR COUNTRY, THAT I WAS RAISED TO BELIEVE IN, WILL BE THERE FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. I'M THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FACTORY WORKER FROM SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA, WHO WENT TO WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THE SCRANTON LACE MILLS. HE WORKED REALLY HARD. AND HE DID IT TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY, ABOUT HE ALSO DID IT BECAUSE HE WANTED HIS THREE SONS TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE. AND THEY DID. THEY ALL WENT TO COLLEGE. AND THEN MY DAD GRADUATED IN MIDDLE OF THE DEPRESSION, HEARD THERE WAS A JOB IN CHICAGO, HOPPED A FREIGHT TRAIN GLOCK,   GOT THE JOB, BECAME A SALESMAN, WENT INTO THE NAVY, CAME OUT, STARTED A SMALL BUSINESS. ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT HIS HARD WORK WOULD BE REWARDED, AND HIS FREEDOM WOULD BE GUARANTEED. MY MOM HAD A VERY DIFFERENT LIFE. SHE WAS REJECTED AND ABANDONED BY HER PARENTS, SENT TO LIVE WITH GRANDPARENTS WHO CAN'T WANT HER, AND THEN BY THE AGE OF 14 WAS WORKING AS A HOUSE MAID. I DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THIS UNTIL I WAG OLDER AND I WAS PRETTY SHOCKED. IT WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE REALLY SOLID LIFE THAT SHE GAVE ME. AND I ASKED HER, HOW DID YOU DO IT? SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, ALONG THE WAY, PEOPLE WERE KIND TO ME. NOT MY FAMILY, BUT A TEACHER, EVEN THE WOMAN WHOSE HOUSE I WORKED IN. SHE, TOO, ALWAYS BELIEVED IN THAT PROMISE OF OUR COUNTRY. SO NOW I HAVE THIS AMAZING GRANDCHILD, AND I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN AS WILL MY HUSBAND TO MAKE SURE SHE HAS EVERY OPPORTUNITY SHE COULD POSSIBLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. IT REALLY MATTERS WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY SHE BECOMES AN ADULT IN. AND WHAT KIND OF WORLD IS OUT THERE WAITING FOR HER. AND I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE TO BE THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FORMER PRESIDENT TO HAVE THE PROMISE OF AMERICA MADE REAL FOR YOU. I THINK YOU SHOULD BE THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FACTORY WORKER OR THE GRANDSON OF A TRUCK DRIVER AND ALL OTHER CHILDREN ACROSS THE LAND, SO LET'S MAKE IT POSSIBLE ONCE AGAIN FOR EVERY CHILD TO HAVE A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. JOIN ME WITH THAT. IT WILL BE ME MISSION AS YOUR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.                                              ",Women for Hillary Campaign Endorsement Announcement

THANK YOU ALL, VERY MUCH. I AM VERY CONSCIOUS THAT I AM ALL THAT STANDS BETWEEN YOU AND THE KICKOFF OF THE PATRIOTS GAME. IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE HERE VERY I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO HAS WORKED SO HARD TO BUILD THIS CAMPAIGN FROM THE BOTTOM UP ALL OVER THIS STATE. I AM SO HONORED TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF YOUR TERRIFIC SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN AND YOUR AMAZING GOVERNOR AND YOUR NEXT SENATOR MAGGIE HASSAN. THEY INSPIRE ME EVERY DAY WITH THEIR LEADERSHIP. I ALSO WANT TO THANK CONGRESSWOMAN CUSTER AND CAROL SHAKE ORDER FOR ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT AND EXECUTIVE COUNSELORS, LOCAL LEADERS, GRASSROOTS ORGANIZERS, WHO ARE DOING SO MUCH ACROSS THIS STATE. WITH YOUR HELP, WE ARE GOING TO ELECT DEMOCRATS UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT NEXT YEAR.  NOW, SOME OF YOU KNOW THAT NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SPECIAL PLACE FOR ME AND MY FAMILY. YOU HAVE FOUGHT FOR ME AND NOW I AM FIGHTING FOR YOU. SINCE THE START OF THIS CAMPAIGN, I HAVE HEARD THE WORRIES THAT KEEP NEW HAMPSHIRE FAMILIES UP AT NIGHT AND I HAVE HEARD THE HOPES THAT GET YOU UP IN THE WARNING -- MORNING. THE STRESS WHEN BILLS PILE UP. JUST WALKING TO THE MAILBOX CAN BE AN ACT OF COURAGE. THE PRIDE IN GETTING THAT AT HER JOB. FEELING SECURE ENOUGH TO PUT A LITTLE MORE A WAY FOR YOUR RETIREMENT. YOU HAVE SHARED WITH ME THE FEELINGS THAT YOU HAVE WHEN YOU ARE FEELING -- CARING FOR AN AGING PARENT OR A CHILD SUFFERING FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR A LOVED ONE WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS. I LISTENED TO YOUR STORIES AND AM HUMBLED BY THE COURAGE AND RESILIENCE. IT CAN TAKE ALL THE STRENGTH YOU HAVE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE ALREADY UNDER PRESSURE AT WORK AND THERE IS NOT ANYONE TO LEAN ON AT HOME. I KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER. JUST IN THE WAY YOU FOUND A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK AND THE WORST OF THE RECESSION, TAKING AN EXTRA JOB, WORKING AN EXTRA SHIFT, PUTTING AWAY A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY WHERE YOU COULD. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS RECOVERY WORK FOR YOU. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR ECONOMY WORK FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST FOR THOSE AT THE TOP.  WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT BY MAKING PROMISES WE CANNOT KEEP. WE ARE GOING TO DO IT THE WAY WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE IT BEFORE. ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES AND GETTING THE JOB DONE TOGETHER. NEXT TO THE HARD WORK AND DETERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WE HAVE COME BACK FROM THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. I WANT TO ASK YOU TO REMEMBER THE MESS PRESIDENT OBAMA INHERITED. I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THE FACT OUR ECONOMY DOES BETTER WHEN WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THIS IS EVIDENCE THAT OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS WOULD PREFER WE FORGET. THEY WOULD DO EVERY THING THEY CAN'T TO IMPOSE A STATE OF COLLECTIVE AMNESIA ON US. I CANNOT GOING TO LET THEM FORGET. THE LAST 30 YEARS WE HAVE HAD FIVE RESIDENTS. THREE REPUBLICANS AND TWO DEMOCRATS. I HAPPEN TO KNOW MOST OF THOSE DEMOCRATS. EACH OF THEM INHERITED ECONOMIC PROBLEMS FROM THEIR REPUBLICAN PREDECESSOR. IN MY HUSBAND'S CASE, IT WAS A RECESSION. THE DEBT OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN QUADRUPLED IN THE PREVIOUS 12 YEARS. I REMEMBER BILL TELLING ME SHORTLY AFTER THE ELECTION, IT IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN THEY TOLD US. HE WAS ASKED AT THE TIME, WHAT DO YOU BRING TO THE WHITE HOUSE FROM ARKANSAS? HE THOUGHT AND HE SAID, ARITHMETIC I GUESS. HE GOT TO WORK. EIGHT YEARS LATER, WE HAD 23 MILLION NEW JOBS AND INCOME ROSE FOR EVERYBODY, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP, BUT PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE, WORKING PEOPLE, AND POOR PEOPLE ALL SAW THEIR INCOMES GO UP. AND WE ENDED UP WITH A BALANCED BUDGET AND A SURPLUS. YOU WOULD THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE GIVEN THE REPUBLICANS AN IDEA ABOUT HOW TO RUN THE ECONOMY. INSTEAD, THEY WENT RIGHT ACT TO TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS. CUTTING TAXES FOR THE WEALTHY, GETTING OUT OF THE WAY OF CORPORATIONS. SHORTLY AFTER THE '08 ELECTION, PRESIDENT OBAMA CALLED ME AND ASKED ME TO MEET WITH HIM IN CHICAGO. I DID NOT KNOW WHY. IT TURNED OUT HE WANTED ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE. BEFORE WE GOT TO THAT, HE SAID THAT IT IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN THEY TOLD US. I HAVE HEARD THAT BEFORE. BUT IT WAS. WE WERE ON THE BRINK OF A GREAT DEPRESSION. WE WERE LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH. HE FOR THE PRESIDENT TURNED IT AROUND, 9 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS. 5 MILLION HOMES LOST TO FORECLOSURE. $13 TRILLION IN FAMILY WEALTH DISAPPEARED. NOW, I DO NOT THINK THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA GETS THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR SAVING THE ECONOMY ON THE REPUBLICAN MESS THAT HE INHERITED.  BUT WE'RE STILL NOT RUNNING THE WAY AMERICA SHOULD. PAYCHECKS FOR MOST PEOPLE HAVE BARELY BUDGED. CORPORATE PROFITS AND CEO PAY ARE AT NEAR RECORD HIGHS. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE TOP 25 HEDGE FUND MANAGERS MAKE MORE IN A YEAR THAN ALL OF THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS IN AMERICA COMBINED.  I KNOW, THERE ARE BIG CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY THAT DID NOT START WITH THE GREAT RECESSION AND THEY WILL NOT END WITH THE GREAT RECOVERY. MANY AMERICANS ARE FINDING IT HARDER AND HARDER TO GET AHEAD. THERE IS TOO MUCH TALENT THAT SITS ON THE SIDELINES. COSTS THAT HIT HARD-WORKING FAMILIES LIKE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND COLLEGE TO WISH AND ARE ALL RISING FASTER THAN INCOME. THAT IS WHY IN THIS CAMPAIGN I AM FIGHTING FOR AN ECONOMY WERE NOTHING HOLD YOU BACK AND EVERYONE WHO WORKS HARD CAN GET AHEAD AGAIN. OPPORTUNITIES SHOULD BE AS UNIVERSAL AS TALENT. AMERICA CAN ONLY LIVE UP TO OUR POTENTIAL WHEN EVERY PERSON CAN LIVE UP TO HIS OR HERS. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE AMERICA WE ARE FIGHTING FOR TOGETHER. IT IS AN AMERICA THAT CREATES GOOD PAYING JOBS FOR THE FUTURE WHERE WAGES RISE FASTER THAN COST. TODAY, I LAID OUT A PLAN TO HELP PUT AMERICANS TO WORK. REPAIRING OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES AND TUNNELS AND ALL OF THE AIRPORTS AND THE PORTS IN THE RAIL SYSTEMS. HOLDING THAT ECONOMY FOR THE FUTURE. I WAS VERY PROUD TO BE ENDORSED BY MAHER WALSH AND HAVE SO MANY OF THE CONSTRUCTION TRADE UNIONS THAT HAVE ENDORSED ME. THEY KNOW THAT I AM GOING TO PUT THEM BACK TO WORK.  WE WILL ESTABLISH A NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE BANK TO GET MORE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT FLOWING. NOT JUST BRICKS AND MORTAR'S. BY 2020, I WANT 100% OF AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS TO HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE, HIGH SPEED INTERNET NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE.  WE ALSO HAVE TO SET SOME BIG GOALS FOR CLEAN ENERGY AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. I HAVE SAID, LET'S INSTALL HALF A BILLION SOLAR PANELS IN FOUR YEARS AND ENOUGH RENEWABLE ENERGY TO POWER EACH HOME IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS. TO GET PAYCHECKS GROWING, WE MUST RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE SO THAT IT NO LONGER IS A POVERTY WAGE.  NOW, YOU KNOW THE REPUBLICANS DO NOT FAVOR THAT. YOU'VE HEARD THEM. THEY'VE BEEN CRISSCROSSING NEW HAMPSHIRE DAY IN AND DAY OUT. NOT ONE OF THEM BELIEVES IN RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE. I THINK IT IS REALLY UNFAIR WHEN PEOPLE WORK FULL-TIME, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE TWO THIRDS OF MINIMUM-WAGE WORKERS ARE WOMEN, WORK FULL TIME AND CANNOT GET THEMSELVES OUT OF POVERTY. IT IS SHORTSIGHTED. WE ARE A 70% CONSUMPTION ECONOMY. YOU RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE AND THAT PUTS UPWARD PRESSURE ON ADDITIONAL WAGES. THAT MEANS MORE CUT -- CUSTOMERS FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE BUSINESSES. THAT MEANS MORE FINANCIAL SECURITY FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE FAMILIES. IT ACTUALLY HELPS TO SPUR THE ECONOMY. THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE THE REPUBLICANS GOING THROUGH TOWN, ASK THEM WHAT THEY DO NOT LIKE ABOUT RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE TO HELP PEOPLE GET AHEAD AND HELP OUR ECONOMY DO BETTER.  AND YOU KNOW, I'M ALMOST EMBARRASSED SAYING THIS, IT IS NOVEMBER OF 2015, AFTER ALL. IT IS TIME TO FINALLY GUARANTEE EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN.  NOW AGAIN, THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT THE REPUBLICANS JUST DO NOT BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BEFORE. I DON'T GET THIS EITHER. WHEN YOU SHORTCHANGE WOMEN, YOU SHORTCHANGE FAMILIES, YOU SHORTCHANGE THE ECONOMY. THE NEXT TIME THEY COME THROUGH ONE OF THE TOWNS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, YOU SEE THEM ON THE STREET. STOP THEM AND ASK THEM, WHY DON'T THEY BELIEVE IN EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK FOR WOMEN? AND WE HAVE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR SMALL BUSINESSES GET THE LOANS THAT THEY NEED TO GROW AND HIRE NOT JUST THE CORPORATIONS THAT CAN AFFORD TO HIRE THE LOBBYISTS TO GROW EVEN BIGGER THAN THEY ARE. AND WE HAVE TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES THAT LET CORPORATIONS SHIP JOBS OVERSEAS. INSTEAD, INVEST IN JOBS RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA. WORKERS SHARING PROFITS WITH EMPLOYEES INSTEAD OF BIGGER BONUSES FOR CEO'S. IF IT WORKS HERE IN NEW ENGLAND, IT CAN WORK FOR AMERICA.  NOW, SO FAR AS I KNOW, I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE THAT HAS PLEDGED TO RAISE HER WAGES, NOT YOUR TAXES. THOSE AT THE TOP SHOULD PAY MORE AND YOU SHOULD A LAST. I HAVE PROPOSED TAX CUTS TO HELP MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES PAY FOR COLLEGE, PAY FOR WELFARE, AND HELP TO PAY FOR AN ELDERLY PARENT. I OPPOSE ANY PROPOSAL THAT TAKES ANY MONEY OUT OF YOUR PAYCHECKS. WE ARE FIGHTING FOR AN AMERICA WHERE EVERYONE WHO WORKS HARD HAS A LADDER OF OPPORTUNITY AND THAT STARTS WITH HIGH-QUALITY PRESCHOOL AVAILABLE FOR EVERY FAMILY IN THIS COUNTRY.  ALL OF OUR KIDS DESERVE THE BEST START IN LIFE. IT ALSO MEANS GETTING BACK WHAT WORKS IN K-12 EDUCATION AND SUPPORTING OUR TEACHERS, NOT SCAPEGOATING THEM.  IT MEANS MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BORROW A DIME TO PAY TO WISH AND AT A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. EVERYBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO REFINANCE THEIR STUDENT THAT, JUST LIKE THEY CAN REFINANCE A MORTGAGE OR A CAR LOAN. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO AFFORDABLE COLLEGE, I WILL NOT SPEND YOUR TAX DOLLARS -- TAX DOLLARS PAYING FOR ARNOLD TRUMP'S KIDS TO GO TO COLLEGE. THAT IS NOT A GOOD INVESTMENT. THAT IS NOT SMART. I WANT TO HELP WORKING-CLASS, MIDDLE-CLASS, AND POOR KIDS GO TO COLLEGE.  AND I BELIEVE A TRUE LADDER OF OPPORTUNITY HAS TO INCLUDE LIFELONG LEARNING, JOB TRAINING, AND APPRENTICESHIP. HERE IN BOSTON I TALKED ABOUT APPRENTICESHIP. I THINK IT IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO PREPARE YOUNG PEOPLE AND YOUNG PEOPLE RETURNING TO THE WORKFORCE FOR THE JOBS THAT WE HAVE. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT MIDDLE-CLASS JOBS SHOULD LEAD TO A SECURE RETIREMENT THAT YOU CAN COUNT ON.  I WILL FIGHT TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND EXPANDED FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST, ESPECIALLY ELDERLY WOMEN, WIDOWS, AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPENT YEARS CARING FOR OTHERS WITHOUT GETTING PAID.  THE CAREGIVERS OF A AMERICA DESERVE SECURITY, JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. WE ARE ALSO FIGHTING FOR AN AMERICA THAT LEADS THE WORLD IN STRENGTH AND SMARTS. KEEPING OUR PEOPLE SAFE AND DEFEATING THE TERRORIST NETWORKS THAT DEFEAT US. WE NEED EVERY PILLAR OF AMERICAN POWER TO GET MORE ALLIES OFF THE SIDELINE TO GO AFTER ISIS IN THE AIR, ON THE GROUND, AND IN CYBERSPACE. WE CANNOT GIVE IN TO THE FEAR MONGERS THAT SAY WE ARE AT WAR WITH ISLAM OR WE SHOULD PUT EVERY MUSLIM IN AMERICA IN A GOVERNMENT DATABASE. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THAT IS NOT SMART LAW-ENFORCEMENT TECHNIQUES TO FIND OUT THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO KEEP US SAFE IN THE FIRST PLACE.  LOOK, THE FACT IS THAT NO OTHER COUNTRY ON EARTH IS IN BETTER POSITION TO THRIVE IN THE 21ST CENTURY. I HAPPEN TO THINK THAT AMERICA IS ALREADY GREAT. WE HAVE TO WORK TO MAKE IT GREATER BY WORKING TOGETHER AND SOLVING OUR PROBLEMS AGAIN.  IN THIS ELECTION, YOU AREN'T JUST CHOOSING A PRESIDENT, YOU ARE CHOOSING A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. I PROMISE YOU I WILL GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY AND DO WHAT IT TAKES TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE AND STRONG. I TAKE THIS VERY PERSONALLY. I WAS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK ON 9/11. I SPENT YEARS WORKING WITH THE VICTIMS OF THAT HORRIFIC ATTACK. WORKING WITH THE FEW SURVIVORS WHO WERE SO GRIEVOUSLY INJURED. WORKING WITH THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO RAN TOWARDS THE PILE AND STAYED THERE FOR MONTHS, ENDING UP SICK THEMSELVES. I TAKE A BACK SEAT TO NO ONE WHEN I TELL YOU I WILL DO WHAT EVER IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT US. I WILL ALSO DO IT IN A WAY THAT FURTHER PROMOTES OUR VALUES AND MAKES IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THIS COUNTRY OF OURS WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD THE WORLD, NOT ONLY IN THE DANGEROUS SPOTS, THAT IN PURSUIT OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL MAKE US EVEN GREATER IN THE FUTURE.

THANK YOU, RICHARD, AND THANKS FOR THE GREAT WORK THAT THE COUNCIL DOES YOU SHOULD YOUR LEADERSHIP, IT TRULY IS AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR US ALL. I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVE HAVING THE CONVERSATION WITH YOU. EVERYONE HERE AT THE COUNCIL AND MR. MAYOR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND FOR EVERYTHING YOU ARE DOING AND WILL DO TO KEEP OUR CITY SAFE AND STRONG. I'M VERY GRATEFUL. I WANTED TO COME HERE TO OUR CITY, WHICH HAS SHOWN SUCH RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF TERRORISM TO TALK ABOUT THE EVENTS OF THE PAST WEEK AND THE WORK WE MUST DO TOGETHER TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY AND OUR FRIENDS. WHEN THE UNITED STATES WAS HIT ON 9/11 OUR ALLIES TREATED THAT ATTACK AGAINST ONE AS AN ATTACK AGAINST ALL. NOW, IT'S OUR TURN TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY, FRANCE AND ALL OF OUR FRIENDS. WE CHERISH THE SAME VALUES AND WE MUST SHARE THE SAME DETERMINATION. AFTER A MAJOR TERRORIST ATTACK, EVERY SOCIETY FACES A CHOICE BETWEEN FEAR AND RESOLVE. THE WORLD'S GREAT DEMOCRACIES ISN'T SACRIFICE OUR VALUES OR TURN OUR BACKS ON THOSE IN NEED, THEREFORE, WE MUST CHOOSE RESOLVE AND WE MUST LEAD THE WORLD TO MEET THIS THREAT. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE ARE FACING. BEYOND PARIS IN RECENT DAYS WE HAVE SEEN DEADLY TERRORISTS ATTACKS IN NIGERIA, LEBANON, IRAQ AND TURKEY AND RUSSIAN CIVILIAN AIRLINE DESTROYED IN SANAI. THEY PER -- PERSECUTE RELIGIONS. AN INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST NETWORK THAT INCLUDES AFFILIATES ACROSS THE REGION AND BEYOND AND AN IDEOLOGICAL MOVEMENT. AND TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. ISIS IS DEMONSTRATED NEW AMBITION, REACH AND CAPABILITIES. WE HAVE TO BREAK THE GROUP'S MOMENTUM AND THEN IT'S BACK. OUR GOAL IS NOT TO DETER OR CONTAIN ISIS BUT TO DEFEAT AND DESTROY ISIS. BUT WE HAVE LEARNED THAT WE CAN SCORE VICTORIES OVER TERRORIST LEADERS AND NETWORKS ONLY TO FACE THREATS DOWN THE ROAD. SO WE ALSO HAVE TO PLAY AND WIN THE LONG GAME. WE SHOULD PURSUE A COMPREHENSIVE COUNTERTERRORISM STRATEGY. ONE THAT EMBEDS OUR MISSION WITHIN ISIS WITHIN RADICAL JEHADISM THAT'S BIGGER THAN ANY ONE GROUP. WHETHER IT'S AL-QAEDA OR ISIS OR SOME OTHER NETWORK. AN IMMEDIATE WAR AGAINST AN URGENT ENEMY AND GENERATIONAL STRUGGLE WITH DEEP ROOTS WILL NOT BE EASILY TORN OUT. IT WILL REQUIRE POWER. ONE DEFEAT ISIS IN SYRIA, IRAQ AND ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. THREE, HARDEN OUR DEFENSES AND THOSE OF OUR ALLIES AGAINST EXTERNAL AND HOME-GROWN THREATS. LET ME START WITH THE CAMPAIGN TO DEFEAT ISIS ACROSS THE REGION. UNITED STATES AND OUR INTERNATIONAL COALITION HAS BEEN CONDUCTING THIS FIGHT FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. IT'S TIME TO BEGIN A NEW PHASE AND INTENSIFY AND BROADEN OUR EFFORTS TO SMASH AND DENY ISIS CONTROL OF TERRITORY IN IRAQ AND SYRIA. THAT STARTS WITH A MORE EFFECTIVE COALITION AIR CAMPAIGN, WITH MORE ALLIED PLANES, MORE STRIKES AND A BROADER TARGET SET. A KEY OBSTACLE STANDING IN A WAY IS A SHORTAGE OF GOOD INTELLIGENCE ABOUT ISIS AND ITS OPERATION. SO WE NEED AN IMMEDIATE INTELLIGENCE IN THE REGION INCLUDING TECH -- TECHNICAL AND SPEAKERS WITH CLOSER PARTNERSHIP WITH REGIONAL AND INTELLIGENT SERVICES. OUR GOAL TO ACHIEVE PENETRATION THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED WITH AL-QAEDA IN THE PAST. THIS WILL HELP US IDENTIFY AND ELIMINATES ISIS COMMAND AND CONTROL AND ITS ECONOMIC LIFELINES. A MORE EFFECTIVE COALITION AIR CAMPAIGN IS NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT. WE SHOULD BE HONEST ABOUT THE FACT THAT TO BE SUCCESSFUL AIR STRIKES WILL HAVE TO BE COMBINED WITH GROUND FORCES ACTUALLY TAKING BACK MORE TERRITORY FROM ISIS. BY PRESIDENT OBAMA I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD AGAIN HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND AMERICAN TROOPS IN COMBAT IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THAT'S JUST NOT THE SMART MOVE TO MAKE HERE. IF WE'VE LEARNED FROM ANYTHING FROM 15 YEARS OF WAR IS THAT LOCAL PEOPLE AND NATIONS HAVE TO SECURE THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. WE CAN HELP THEM AND WE SHOULD, BUT WE CANNOT SUBSTITUTE FOR THEM. WHAT WE CAN AND SHOULD SUPPORT LOCAL AND REGIONAL GROUND FORCES IN CARRYING OUT THIS MISSION. NOW THE OBSTACLES TO ACHIEVING THIS ARE SIGNIFICANT. ON THE IRAQI SIDE OF THE BORDER KURDISH HAVE FOUGHT TO DEFEND THEIR OWN LANDS. BUT THE IRAQI NATIONAL ARMY HAS STRUGGLED AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE WORK TO GET IT UP TO FIGHTING SHAPE. AS PART OF THAT PROCESS WE MAY HAVE TO GIVE OUR OWN TROOPS ADVISING AND TRAINING IRAQIS GREATER FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND FLEXIBILITY AND HELPING TARGET AIR STRIKES. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, THE CAMPAIGN WILL SUCCEED IF MORE IRAQI SOONIES WILL JOIN THE FIGHT, BUT THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN SO LONG THEY FEEL THEY DO NOT HAVE A STAKE IN THEIR COUNTRY OR CONFIDENCE IN THEIR OWN SECURITY AND CAPACITY TO CONFRONT ISIS. NOW WE'VE BEEN IN A SIMILAR PLACE BEFORE IN IRAQ. IN THE FIRST SOONIE AWAKENING IN 2007 WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT SUPPORT TO PERSUADE THEM TO JOIN US IN ROOTING OUT AL-QAEDA. UNFORTUNATELY UNDER PRIME MINISTER MALAKI'S RULE, THEY WERE FORGOTTEN. BUT NONETHELESS, WE NEED TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR A SECOND SOONIE AWAKENING. WE NEED TO PUT SUSTAINED PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT IN BAGDAD TO GET POLITICAL HOUSE IN ORDER AND MOVE FORWARD WITH RECONCILIATION AND FINALLY STAND UP A NATIONAL GUARD. BAGDAD NEEDS TO ACCEPT, EVEN EMBRACE ARMING SOONIE AND KURDISH FORCES IN THE WAR AGAINST ISIS. IF BAGHDAD WON'T DO THAT, COALITION SHOULD DO. MORE GROUND SERVICES TO ENGAGE ISIS BEYOND THE SYRIAN CURDS THAT ARE DEEP IN THE FIGHT. THE VIABLE SOONIE OPPOSITION GROUPS REMAINS PREOCCUPIED WITH FIGHTING ASSAD, WHO LET US REMEMBER HAS KILLED MANY MORE SYRIANS THAN THE TERRORISTS HAVE. BUT THEY ARE INCREASINGLY UNDER THREAT FROM ISIS AS WELL. SO WE NEED TO MOVE SIMULTANEOUSLY TOWARD A POLITICALLY SOLUTION TO THE CIVIL WAR THAT PAVES THE WAY FOR A NEW GOVERNMENT WITH NEW LEADERSHIP AND ENCOURAGE MORE SYRIANS TO TAKE ON ISIS AS WELL. TO SUPPORT THEM, WE SHOULD IMMEDIATELY DEPLOY THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCE PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ALREADY AUTHORIZED AND BE PREPARED TO DEPLOY MORE AS MORE SYRIANS GET INTO THE FIGHT AND WE SHOULD RETOOL AND RAMP UP OUR EFFORTS TO SUPPORT AND EQUIP VIABLE SYRIAN OPPOSITION UNITS. OUR INCREASED SUPPORT SHOULD GO HAND-IN-HAND WITH INCREASE SUPPORT FROM ARAB AND EUROPEAN PARTNERS INCLUDING SPECIAL FORCES WHO CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE FIGHT ON THE GROUND. WE SHOULD ALSO WORK WITH COALITION AND NEIGHBORS TO IMPOSE NO-FLY ZONES THAT WILL STOP ASSAD FROM SLAUGHTERING CIVILIANS AND OPPOSITION FROM THE AIR. OPPOSITION FORCES ON THE GROUND WITH MATERIAL SUPPORT FROM THE COALITION PRESENT SAFE AREAS WHERE SYRIANS COULD REMAIN IN THE COUNTRY RATHER THAN FLEEING TOWARD EUROPE. THIS COMBINED APPROACH WOULD HELP ENABLE THE OPPOSITION TO RETAKE THE REMAINING STRETCH OF THE TURKISH BORDER FROM ISIS CHOKING OFF ITS SUPPLY LINES. IT WOULD ALSO GIVE US NEW LEVERAGE IN THE DIPLOMATIC PROCESS THAT SECRETARY KERRY IS PURSUING. OF COURSE, WE'VE BEEN DONE SEVERAL DIPLOMATIC DEAD-ENDS BEFORE IN THE CONFLICT, BUT WE HAVE MODELS HOW SEEMINGLY AND TRACTABLE MULTICIVIL WARS DO EVENTUALLY END. WE CAN LEARN LESSONS FROM LEBANON AND BOSNIA ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE AND RUSSIA AND IRAN HAVE TO FACE THE FACT THAT CONTINUING TO PROP UP A VICIOUS DICTATOR WILL NOT BRING STABILITY. RIGHT NOW, I'M AFRAID PRESIDENT PUTIN IS MAKING THINGS SOMEWHAT WORSE, TO BE CLEAR, THOUGH, THERE IS AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR RUSSIA TO HELP IN RESOLVING THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA AND WE HAVE INDICATED A WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THEM TOWARD AN OUTCOME THAT PRESERVES SYRIAN AS A STATE WITH PROTECTION TO THE RIGHTS OF ALL SYRIANS AND TO KEEP KEY STATE INSTITUTIONS IN TACT. THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE TO A POLITICAL TRANSITION THAT ALLOWS SYRIANS TO END ASSAD'S RULE. NOW MUCH OF THE STRATEGY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER HINGES ON THE ROLE OF OUR ARAB AND TURKISH PARTNERS AND WE MUST GET THEM TO CARRY THEIR SHARE OF THE BURDEN WITH MILITARY INTELLIGENCE AND FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS AS WELL AS USING THEIR INFLUENCE WITH FIGHTERS AND TRIBES IN IRAQ AND SYRIA. COUNTRIES LIKE JORDAN HAVE OFFERED MORE AND WE SHOULD TAKE THEM UP ON IT BECAUSE ULTIMATELY OUR EFFORTS WILL ONLY SUCCEED IF THE ARABS AND TURKS STEP UP IN A MUCH BIGGER WAY. THIS IS THEIR FIGHT AND THEY NEED TO ACT LIKE IT. SO FAR, HOWEVER, TURKEY HAS BEEN MORE FOCUSED ON THE KURDS THAN ON COUNTERING ISIS. TO BE FAIR, TURKEY HAS A LONG AND PAINFUL HISTORY WITH KURDISH TERRORISTS GROUPS, BUT WE NEED TO GET TURKEY TO STOP BOMBING OCCURREDDISH -- KURDISH FIGHTERS IN SYRIA WHO ARE BATTLING ISIS. THE UNITED STATES SHOULD ALSO WORK WITH OUR ARAB PARTNERS TO GET THEM NOR INVESTED IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS. AT THE MOMENT THEIR FOCUS IN OTHER AREAS BECAUSE OF THEIR CONCERNS IN THE REGION, SPECIALLY THE THREAT FROM IRAN. THAT'S WHY THE SAUDIS, FOR EXAMPLE, SHIFTED ATTENTION. SO WE HAVE TO WORK A COMMON APPROACH. IN SEPTEMBER I LAYED OUT A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO COUNTERACT SUCH AS HEZBOLLAH AND HAMAZ, WE CANNOT VIEW IRAN AND ISIS AS SEPARATE CHALLENGES. REGIONAL POLITICS ARE TOO INTERWOVEN. AND AS WE WORK OUT A REGIONAL APPROACH, WE SHOULD, OF COURSE, BE CLOSELY CONSULTING WITH ISRAEL, OUR STRONGEST ALLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. ISRAEL INCREASINGLY SHARES WITH OUR ARAB PARTNERS AND HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE IN INTELLIGENCE AND JOINT EFFORTS AS WELL. NOW, WE SHOULD HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT THE MISSION BEFORE US REALLY IS. WE HAVE TO FIT A LOT OF PIECES TOGETHER AND MOVE ON MULTIPLE FRONT SEAT AT ONCE, BUT IF WE PRESS FORWARD ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER IN THE AIR AND ON THE GROUND, I BELIEVE WE CAN CRUSH ISIS TERROR, AND TO SUPPORT THIS CAMPAIGN, CONGRESS SHOULD SWIFTLY PASS AUTHORIZATION TO USE MILITARY FORCE. THAT WILL SEND A MESSAGE TO FRIEND AND FOE ALIKE THAT THE UNITED STATES IS COMMITTED TO THIS FIGHT. THE TIME FOR DELAY IS OVER, WE SHOULD GET THIS DONE. NOW, THE SECOND ALMOST OF OUR STRATEGY LOOKS BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE BATTLEFIELD OF IRAQ AND SYRIA TO DISRUPT AND DISMANTLE GLOBAL TERRORISTS INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE GROUND AND ON LINE. A TERROR PIPELINE THAT FACILITIES THE FLAW OF FIGHTERS, FINANCING, ARMS AND PROPAGANDA AROUND THE WORLD HAS ALLOWED ISIS TO STRIKE AT THE HEART OF PARIS LAST WEEK AND AL-QAEDA TO DO THE SAME EARLIER THIS YEAR. ISIS IS WORKING HARD TO EXTEND ITS REACH, ESTABLISH AFFILIATES FAR FROM HOME BASE AND DESPITE SIGNIFICANT SET ABACKS -- SETBACKS IT HAS ENCOUNTERED BUT EVEN AL-QAEDA, INCLUDING THE DEATH OF OSAMA BEN LADEN, THEY ARE STILL POSING GREAT THREAT TO SO MANY. LET'S TAKE ONE EXAMPLE. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT ISIS IN THE LAST WEEK. LET'S NOT FORGET AL-QAEDA. THEY STILL HAVE THE MOST SOPHISTICATED BOMB MAKERS AND VICIOUS PLOTTERS AND ACTIVE AFFILIATES IN PLACES LIKE YEMEN AND NORTH AFRICA. WE CAN'T JUST FOCUS ON IRAN AND SYRIA. MOST URGENT IS STOPPING THE FLOW OF FOREIGN FIGHTERS TO AND FROM THE WAR ZONES OF THE MIDDLE EAST, THOUSANDS OF YOUNG RECRUITS HAVE FLOCKED TO SYRIA, BELGIUM, UNITED KINGDOM, AND YES, EVEN THE UNITED STATES. THEIR WESTERN PASSPORTS MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO CROSS BORDERS AND EVENTUALLY RETURN HOME RAL -- RADICALIZED. WE SHOULD NOT STOP PRESSING UNTIL TURKEY, WHERE MOST FOREIGN FIGHTERS CROSS INTO SYRIA FINALLY LOCKS DOWN ITS BORDERS. UNITED STATES AND ALLIES NEED TO KNOW AND SHARE THE IDENTITIES OF EVERY FIGHTER THAT HAS TRAVELED TO SYRIA. WE HAVE TO BE SMART AND TARGET INTERVENTIONS THAT WILL HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE NEED A GREATER FOCUS ON SHUTTING DOWN KEY ENABLERS WHO ARRANGE TRANSPORTATION, DOCUMENTS AND MORE. WHEN IT COMES TO TERRORIST FINANCING WE HAVE TO GO AFTER THE ONCE WHO FACILITATE. UN SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD UPDATE TERRORISM SANCTIONS. THEY HAVE A RESOLUTION THAT DOES TRY TO BLOCK TERRORIST FINANCING AND OTHER ENABLING ACTIVITIES, BUT WE HAVE TO PLACE MORE OBLIGATIONS ON COUNTRIES TO POLICE THEIR OWN BANKS AND THE UNITED STATES WHICH HAS QUITE A RECORD OF SUCCESS IN THIS AREA CAN SHARE MORE INTELLIGENCE TO HELP OTHER COUNTRIES. AND ONCE AND FOR ALL THE SAUDIS AND OTHERS NEED TO STOP THEIR CITIZENS FROM DIRECTLY FUNDING EXTREMIST ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS SCHOOLS AND MOSQUES AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAVE SET TOO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ON A PATH TO RAT -- RADICALIZATION. WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY THE HOT SPOTS, THE SPECIFIC NEIGHBORHOODS AND VILLAGES, THE PRISONS AND SCHOOLS WHERE RECRUITMENT HAPPENS IN CLUSTERS LIKE THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN BRUSSELS WHERE THE TERRORIST ATTACKS WERE PLANNED. THROUGH PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY SPECIAL YOU WITH MUSLIM LEADERS, WE HAVE TO IN THESE HOT SPOTS. THERE'S NO DOUBT WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB CONTESTING ONLINE SPACE INCLUDING WEBSITES AND CHAT ROOMS WHERE JIHADIST COMMUNICATE WITH FOLLOWINGERS. -- FOLLOWERS. AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT I BUILD UP A UNIT OF COMMUNICATION SPECIALISTS FLUENT IN ARABIC, SOMALIAN TO BATTLE WITH EXTREMISTS ONLINE. WE NEED MORE OF THAT INCLUDING FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR. SOCIAL MED ACCOMPANIES CAN ALSO DO THEIR PART BY SWIFTLY SHUTTING DOWN TERRORIST ACCOUNTS SO THEY ARE NOT USED TO PLAN FOR BOTH OR CELEBRATE VIOLENCE. ONLINE OR OFFLINE, THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE ARE IN A CONTEXT OF IDEAS AGAINST AN IDEOLOGY OF HATE AND WE HAVE TO WIN. LET'S BE CLEAR, ISLAM IS NOT OUR ADVERSARY. MUSLIMS ARE PEACEFUL AND TOLERANT PEOPLE AND HAVE NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH TERRORISM. THE OBSESSION IN SOME CORDERS WITH CLASH OF CIVILIZATION OR REPEATING THE SPECIFIC RECORDS, RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM ISN'T JUST A DISTRACTION, IT GIVES THESE CRIMINALS, MORE MURDERERRERS MORE STANDING THAN THEY DESERVE. OUR PRIORITY SHOULD BE HOW TO FIGHT THE ENEMY. IN THE END, IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT KIND OF TERRORISTS WE CALLED BEN LADEN, IT MATTERED THAT WE KILLED BEN LADEN, BUT WE STILL CAN'T CLOSE OUR EYES TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS A DISTORTED AND DANGEROUS STREAM OF EXTREMISM WITHIN THE MUSLIM WORLD THAT CONTINUES TO SPREAD. IT'S ADHERENT BUT CAPABLE OF CAUSING PROFOUND DAMAGE, MOST SPECIALLY TO THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT AN ARC OF INSTABILITY THAT STRETCHES FROM NORTH AND WEST AFRICA TO ASIA. OVERLAPPING CONFLICTS, COLLAPSING STRUCTURES, POVERTY AND REPRESSION HAVE CREATED OPENINGS FOR EXTREMIST TO EXPLOIT. BEFORE THE ARAB SPRING I WARNED THAT THE REGION FOUNDATIONS WOULD SINK INTO THE SAND WITHOUT IMMEDIATE REFORM. THE NEED HAS GROWN MORE URGENT. WE HAVE TO JOIN WITH OUR PARTNERS TO DO THE PATIENT STEADY WORK OF EMPOWERING MODERATES, SUPPORTING DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW, CREATING ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT SUPPORTS STABILITY, WORKING TO CURVE CORRUPTIONS, HELPING TRAIN EFFECTIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LAW ENFORCEMENT INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTERTERRORISM SERVICES. AS WE DO THIS, WE MUST BE BUILDING UP A GLOBAL COUNTERTERRORISM INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS MORE EFFECTIVE AND ADAPTABLE THAN THE TERROR NETWORKS WE ARE TRYING TO DEFEAT WHEN I BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT NEARLY A DECADE THERE WAS NO INTERNATIONAL VEHICLE TO REGULARLY CONVENE COUNTRIES TO DEAL WITH TERRORIST THREATS. SO WE CREATED THE GLOBAL COUNTERTERRORISM FORUM WHICH NOW BRINGS TOGETHER NEARLY 30 COUNTRIES, MANY FROM THE MUSLIM WORLD. IT SHOULD BE A CLEARING HOUSE FOR DIRECTING ASSISTANCE FOR COUNTRIES THAT NEED IT AND LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT OF COOPERATION OF NUCLEAR MATERIAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS AND KEEP THEM OUT OF THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS. AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE STILL MUST BE PREPARED TO GO AFTER TERRORISTS WHEREVER THEY PLOT USING OUR TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL. THAT INCLUDES TARGETED STRIKES BY MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND DRONES WITH PROPER SAFE GUARDS WHEN THERE ARE AREN'T ANY OTHER VILABLE OPTIONS TO DEAL WITH CONTINUEING EMINENT THREATS. BLOCKING FINANCING, BATTLE IN CYBERSPACE IS VITAL TO THE WORLD AGAINST ISIS BUT ALSO LAYS THE FOUNDATION FOR DIFFUSING AND DEFEATING THE NEXT THREAT AND THE ONE AFTER THAT. THE THIRD ELEMENT OF OUR STRATEGY HAS TO BE HARDENING DEFENSES AT HOME AND HELPING PARTNERS DO THE SAME AGAINST BOTH EXTERNAL AND HOME-GROWN THREATS. THE UNITED STATES MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS BREAKING DOWN BUREAUCRATIC BARRIERS FOR ALLOWING BETTER INFORMATION SHARING AMONG AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING US SAFE. WE STILL HAVE WOULD RECOLLECT TO DO ON THIS FRONT BUT BY COMPARISON EUROPE IS WAY BEHIND. WHEN A PASSPORT IS STOLEN, IT STEAMS LIKE AFTER MOST TERRORIST ATTACKS WE FIND OUT THAT THE PERPETRATORS WERE KNOWN TO SOME SECURITY FORM OR ANOTHER BUT TOO OFTEN THE DOTS NEVER GET CONNECTED. I APPRECIATE HOW HARD THIS IS SPECIALLY GIVEN THE NUMBER OF SUSPECTS AND THREATS, BUT THAT HAS TO CHANGE. UNITED STATES MUST WORK WITH EUROPE TO DRAMATICALLY AND IMPROVE INTELLIGENCE SHARING AND COUNTERTERRORISM COORDINATION. EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ALSO SHOULD HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO ENHANCE THEIR BORDER CONTROLS WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT AND HERE AT HOME WE FACE A NUMBER OF OUR OWN CHALLENGES. THE THREAT TO AIRLINE SECURITY IS EVOLVING AS TERRORISTS DEVELOP NEW DEVICES LIKE NONMET ALIC BOMBS, SO OUR DEFENSES HAVE TO STAY AT LEAST ONE STEP AHEAD. WE KNOW THAT INTELLIGENCE GATHERED AND SHARED BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO BREAKING UP PLOTS AND PREVENTING ATTACKS, SO THEY NEED ALL THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT WE CAN GIVE THEM. LAW ENFORCEMENT ALSO NEEDS THE TRUST OF RESIDENT AND COMMUNITIES INCLUDING IN OUR OWN COUNTRY MUSLIM AMERICAN. NOW THIS SHOULD GO WITHOUT SAYING BUT IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE IT BEARS REPEATING. ANOTHER CHALLENGE IS HOW TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE OF PROTECTING PRIVACY AND SECURITY. ENCRYPTION OF MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS PRESENTS A PARTICULARLY TOUGH PROBLEM. WE SHOULD TAKE THE CONCERNS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COUNTERTERRORISM PROFESSIONALS SERIOUSLY. THEY HAVE WARNED THAT ENCRYPTION MAY PREVENT THEM FROM ACCESSING TERRORIST COMMUNICATION AND PREVENTING A FUTURE ATTACK. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE KNOW THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT GOVERNMENT INTRUSION, NETWORK SECURITY AND CREATING NEW VULNERABILITIES, THAT BAD ACTORS CAN AND WOULD EXPLOIT. SO WE NEED SILICON VALLEY NOT TO VIEW AS ADVERSARY, WE NEED TO CHALLENGE OUR BEST MINDS TO WORK WITH THE BEST MINDS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS THAT WILL BOTH KEEP US SAFE AND PROTECT OUR PRIVACY. NOW IS THE TIME TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM, NOT AFTER THE NEXT ATTACK. SINCE PARIS, NO HOMELAND SECURITY CHALLENGE IS BEING MORE HOTLY DEBATED THAN HOW TO HANDLE SYRIAN REFUGEES SEEKING SAFETY IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY, OF COURSE, MUST ALWAYS BE PROTECTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, SO, YES, WE DO NEED TO BE VIGILANT IN SCREENING REFUGEES FROM SYRIA GUIDED BY THE BEST JUDGMENT OF OUR SECURITY PROFESSIONALS IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS AND CONGRESS NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES ARE PROVIDED FOR COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS DRAWING ON THE BEST INTELLIGENCE WE CAN GET, AND WE SHOULD BE TAKING A CLOSE LOOK AT THE SAFE GUARDS AND THE VISA PROGRAMS AS WELL, BUT WE CANNOT ALLOW TERRORIST TO INTIMIDATE US IN ABANDONING OUR VALUES AND OUR HUMANITARIAN OBLIGATIONS. TURNING AWAY ORPHANS AND APPLYING TEST AND DISCRIMINATING AND SLAMMING THE DOOR ON EVERY SYRIAN REFUGEE, THAT'S JUST NOT WHO WE ARE. WE ARE BETTER THAN THAT, AND REMEMBER MANY OF THE REFUGEES ARE FLEEING THE SAME TERRORISTS THAT ARE THREATENING US. IT WOULD BE A CRUEL IRONY INDEED IF ISIS CAN FORCE FAMILIES FROM THEIR HOME AND ALSO PREVENT THEM FROM EVER FINDING NEW ONES. WE SHOULD BE DOING MORE TO EASE THIS HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, NOT LESS. WE SHOULD LEAD THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN ORGANIZING A DONOR CONFERENCE AND SUPPORTING COUNTRIES LIKE JORDAN WHO ARE SHELTERING THE MAJORITY OF REFUGEES FLEEING SYRIA, AND WE CAN GET THIS RIGHT, AMERICA IS OPEN, FREE, TOLERANT SOCIETY IS DESCRIBED BY SOME AS VULNERABILITY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM, BUT I ACTUALLY BELIEVE IT'S ONE OF OUR STRENGTHS. IT REDUCES THE APPEAL OF RADICALISM AND RICHNESS AND RESILIENCE OF OUR COMMUNITIES. IT'S NOT A TIME FOR SCORING POLITICAL POINTS. WHEN NEW YORK WAS ATTACKED ON 9/11, WE HAD A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR AND A REPUBLICAN MAYOR AND I WORKED WITH ALL OF THEM. WE PULLED TOGETHER AND PUT PARTISANSHIP ASIDE TO REBUILD OUR CITY AND PROTECT OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS A TIME FOR AMERICAN LEADERSHIP, NO OTHER COUNTRY CAN RALLY THE WORLD TO DEFEAT ISIS AND WIN THE GENERATIONAL STRUGGLE AGAINST RADICAL JEHADISM. ONLY THE UNITED STATES CAN MOVE COMMON ACTION ON A GLOBAL SCALE, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED. THE ENTIRE WORLD MUST BE PART OF THIS FIGHT, BUT WE MUST LEAD IT. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK LATELY ABOUT COALITIONS. EVERYONE SEEMS TO WANT ONE BUT THERE'S NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS TALK ABOUT WHAT IT ACTUALLY TAKES TO MAKE A COALITION WORK IN THE PRESSURE OF INTERNATIONAL CRISIS. I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS BECAUSE WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE. TO IMPOSE THE TOUGHEST SANCTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF IRAN AND STOP DICTATOR FROM SLAUGHTERING IN LIBYA AND DEMOCRACY IN AFGHANISTAN, WE HAVE TO USE EVERY PILLAR AND THAT IS SMART POWER. WE HAVE TO WORK WITH INSTITUTIONS AND PARTNERS LIKE NATO, EU, ARAB LEAGUE AND UN AND STRENGTHEN ALLIANCES AND NEVER GET TIRED OF OLD-FASHION, SHOW-LEATHER DIPLOMACY. UNITED STATES AND OUR ALLIES MUST DEMONSTRATE THAT FREE PEOPLE AND FREE MARKETS ARE STILL THE HOPE OF HUMANITY. THIS PAST WEEK AS I WATCHED THE TRAGIC SCENES FROM FRANCE, I KEPT THINKING BACK TO A YOUNG MAN THE WORLD MET IN JANUARY AFTER THE LAST ATTACK IN PARIS. HIS NAME WAS LOZANA, MUSLIM IMMIGRANT WHO WORKED AT A KOSHER MARKET. HE SAID IT HAD BECOME A NEW HOME AND COLLEAGUES AND CUSTOMERS A SECOND FAMILY. WHEN THE TERRORISTS ARRIVED AND THE GUNFIRE BEGAN, OZANA RISKED HIS LIFE TO PROTECT HIS JEWISH CUSTOMERS. HE MOVED QUICKLY HIDING AS MANY PEOPLE AS HE COULD IN THE COLD STORAGE ROOMS AND THEN SLIPPING OUT TO HELP THE POLICE. I DIDN'T KNOW OR CARED IF THEY WERE JEWS OR MUSLIMS, WE ARE IN THE SAME BOAT. WHAT A A REBUKE, BUT WHEN IT MATTERED MOST, HE PROVED HE WAS A CITIZEN ALREADY. THAT'S THE POWER OF FREE PEOPLE, THAT'S WHAT THE JEHADIS WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND AND NEVER DEFEAT, AND AS WE MEET HERE TODAY, LET US RESOLVE THAT WE WILL GO FORWARD TOGETHER AND WE WILL DO ALL WE CAN TO LEAD THE WORLD AGAINST THIS THREAT, THAT'S THREATENING PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. THANK YOU ALL.  >>  AN ITENSIFICATION. >> BUT IT HAS TO ALSO INTENSIFY AND ACCELERATE OUR EFFORTS IN THE OTHER ARENAS. WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH AIR STRIKES HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE, BUT NOW IT NEEDS TO MAKE A GREATER DIFFERENCE AND WE NEED MORE OF A COALITION, WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH THE PRESIDENT SAYING THERE WOULD BE SPECIAL FORCES SENT IS RIGHT IN LINE WITH WHAT I THINK BUT THEY NEED TO GET THERE AND CHECK STOCK OF WHETHER WE NEED MORE AND EMPOWER OUR TRAINERS IN IRAQ TO HAVE MORE SUPPORT TO DO WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH BY GETTING THE IRAQI ARMY, ONCE, AGAIN, TO BE A FIGHTING FORCE. AND WHEN HE NEED ONE THING THAT I BELIEVE WE HAVEN'T DONE YET IS MAKE IT CLEAR TO BAGDAD THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ARMING SOONIE TRIBES AND KURDS IF THEY DON'T. BECAUSE AT SOME POINT THEY HAVE TO BE IN THE FIGHT. THE KURDS ARE FIGHTING GREATLY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER AND THEY NEED THE SUPPORT THAT WE'VE GIVEN THEM AND SOME OF THE SPECIAL OPS WORK AND THE ASSAULT AND TAKING BACK OF SINJAR AND THE OTHER TWO ELEMENTS THAT I MENTIONED. WE HAVE TO DEEPEN AND BETTER COORDINATE  OBAMA UNDERESTIMATED ISIS WHEN HE CALLED IT THE JB TEAM? >> I DON'T THINK IT'S USEFUL TO REPLOW OLD GROUND FR THE SPER -- FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT THEY HAD ACCOMPLISHED AT THE TIME, EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD CEASED AND HELD TERRITORY, THE MAJOR FOCUS OF OUR GOVERNMENT WAS ON TRYING TO REMOVE ASSAD FROM POWER SO THAT THERE COULD BE A RESOLUTION, A POLITICAL RESOLUTION AND THERE WERE SO MANY GROUPS FIGHTING. THERE WERE SO MANY OTHER FACTORS AT WORK. NOW THAT ISIS HAS MADE CLEAR THAT I THINK IN PART BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN PUSHED HARD BY THE AIR STRIKES, BY THE KURDS, THEY ARE NOW EXPANDING THEIR REACH SO THAT THEY CAN KEEP THEIR  TIMES, TERRORIST COUNTERATTACK WITH OBAMA. HAS IT? >> IT'S NOT THE FIRST HEADLINE THAT I HAVE DISAGREED. I HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT I HAVE DIFFERENCES. I WAS VERY PROUD TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SECRETARY OF STATE. I THINK WE MADE A GOOD TEAM. WE LARGELY AGREED ON WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE TO REPAIR OUR ALLIANCES TO GET OUR COUNTRY IN A POSITION TO DEAL WITH THE WARS THAT IT HAD BEEN INHERITED AND TAKE ON THE NEW CHALLENGES WE FACED. BUT EVEN WHEN I WAS STILL THERE, I THOUGHT WE NEEDED TO DO MORE TO TRY TO IDENTIFY SYRIAN FIGHTERS, MODERATES, I THINK THERE WERE SOME EARLY ON THAT WE COULD HAVE DONE MORE TO HELP THEM IN THEIR FIGHT AGAINST ASSAD, BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS AN EVOLVING AND FAST-MOVING SITUATION. WE ARE ALL WORKING TO, YOU KNOW, MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE  OBAMA'S ADMINISTRATION IS DOING AND WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING. WHAT DO YOU DISAGREE WITH BOB GATES ON THIS IN. >> I BELIEVE THAT THE NO-FLY ZONE IS MERITED AND CAN BE IMPLEMENTED, AGAIN, IN A COALITION. I FULLY RESPECT BOB AND HIS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES OF IMPLEMENTING A NO-FLY ZONE, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE TO TRY TO CLEAR THE AIR OF THE BOMBING ATTACKS THAT ARE STILL BEING CARRIED OUT BY A SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AND SUPPLEMENTED BY RUSSIAN AIR FORCE. WE HAD A NO-FLY ZONE OVER NORTHERN IRAQ FOR YEARS TO PROTECT THE KURDS AND IT PROVED TO BE SUCCESSFUL, NOT EASY, IT NEVER IS, BUT I THINK NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO REVISIT THOSE PLANS. I ALSO BELIEVE AS I SAID IN THE SPEECH THAT IF WE BEGIN A CONVERSATION ABOUT NO-FLY ZONE, SOMETHING TURKEY DISCUSSED WITH ME WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF STATE IN 2012, IT WILL CONFRONT A LOT OF OUR PARTNERS IN THE REGION AND BEYOND ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO AND CAN GIVE US LEVERAGE OF DISCUSSIONS THAT SECRETARY KERRY IS CARRYING ON RIGHT NOW. I SEE IT AS BOTH A STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY ON THE GROUND AND A -- AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LEVERAGE IN PEACE NEGOTIATIONS. >> YOU TALKED ABOUT ARAB  TO MAKE THEM ACTUALLY TAKE THIS ON AS THEIR STRUGGLE? WELL, WE DID BUILD THE COALITION WITH RESPECT TO LIBYA. WE HAD JORDAN INVOLVED IN WHAT WE WERE DOING ON THE GROUND AND IT TAKES CONSTANT OUTREACH. OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO DEFINE THE PROBLEM AS THE WAY IT'S AFFECTING THEIR INTEREST. THEY HAVE PUT ALL THE RESOURCES AGAINST IRANIAN BACKERS IN YEMEN. NOW WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THEY SEE THE BATTLE THAT THEY WANT TO FIGHT AS ONE AGAINST IRAN AND ITS PROXIES. MY ARGUMENT TO THEM TO ME LEFT UNATTENDED, YOU COULD HAVE IRANIAN REACH. IF YOU ALLOW SYRIA TO FALL INTO AS TERRIBLE OF DISTRESS AS IT CURRENTLY IS AND BASICALLY ASSAD BEING A PROXY FOR A FRONT-MAN FOR THE IRANIANS, RUSSIANS ARE INTERESTED IN THEIR NAVAL BASE. SO WHAT YOU'RE FACING IN YEMEN COULD BE A LIMITED PREVIEW OF WHAT YOU COULD FACE GOING FORWARD UNLESS WE GET SOME CONCERTED EFFORT TO STOP FIGHTING  AS I MENTIONED IN THE SPEECH, I SPOKE ABOUT THE FOUNDATION OF THE AREA SINKING IN THE SAND JUST AS THE ARABS WERE BREAKING. I DID SO NOT KNOWING THE AIR ABOVE SPRING COMING TO FULL BLOOM BUT IT WAS SO CLEAR OF WHAT WAS DOING BY DENIAL OF OPPORTUNITY, BY THE SECRETARY DIVIDE, IT COULD NOT STAND. IT WAS GOING TO EXPLODE AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER. WITH THE DEVELOPMENTS IN LIBYA, FOR EXAMPLE, THE LIBYAN PEOPLE VOTED TWICE IN FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS FOR THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP THEY WANT. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PREVENT THE DISRUPTIONS THAT THEY ARE CONFRONTED WITH BECAUSE OF INTERNAL DIVIDES AND BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE EXTERNAL PRESSURES THAT ARE COMING FROM TERRORIST GROUPS AND OTHERS. SO I THINK IT IS TOO SOON TO TELL. I THINK IT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT VERY CLOSELY. NOW MOST OF IT LEFT PROBLEMS BUT THE PROBLEM WE CAME AT BY HAVING A DEAL, IN FACT MY HUSBAND IS TALKING ABOUT THE DAYTON ACCORDS THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SLAUGHTERING EACH OTHER AND RESULT TO EXIST WITHIN A GOVERNMENT TOGETHER. IS IT PERFECT? NO. BUT HAS IT CAP GOING, AND HAVE WE KEPT GOING. ABSOLUTELY. SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THESE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS ON THEIR OWN AS WELL AS PART OF BIGGER TRENDS. >> SEVERAL OF THE PEOPLE RUNNING AGAINST WHOEVER THE DEMOCRAT  PERSECUTED BY ISIS. >> I JUST DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE RELIGIOUS TESTS OF WHO WE BRING AS REFUGEES IN OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE, IN THE PAST I LOOKED MORE MORE THAN 2 MILLION REFUGEES SINCE 1990. SO FAR, WE KNOW THAT TRYING TO THAT AND UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTIONS THAT A PERSON OR A FAMILY MIGHT HAVE WITH SOMEONE IN THE UNITED STATES, LOOKING TO SEE WHAT ORGANIZATION, OFTEN A FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATION WILL SPONSOR THEM AND WHAT THEY WILL DO TO HELP THEM GET EDUCATION OR JOB. THAT IS BY FAR THE BEST WAY TO SORT OUT AND TO DETERMINE WHO SHOULD BE INCLUDED. NOW, THIS IS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME. REALLY, DOING THIS IS HARD UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. DOING IT WHEN PEOPLE ARE ESSENTIALLY STATELESS, THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE DOCUMENTS, IT IS HARD TO DO THE VETTING. IT IS GOING TO BE CHALLENGING WHICH IS WHY SAID IN THE SPEECH CONGRESS SHOULD BE PROVIDING RESOURCES FOR US TO DO THIS RIGHT. NOT NOT TRYING TO STOP IT. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT IS IN KEEPING  AND WHAT CHANGES WOULD PERHAPS MAKE IT ACCEPTABLE TO YOU? >> THERE ARE TWO PROBLEMS THAT I SEE WITH IT. ONE, THE FINAL LANGUAGE OF THE TREATY ITSELF WHICH I DON'T THINK WENT FAR ENOUGH TO MEET THE TEST THAT I HAVE ALWAYS APPLIED TO ANY TRIED AGREEMENT. I HAVE VOTED FOR THEM AND I HAVE VOTED AGAINST THEM WHEN I WAS A SENATOR. DOES IT HELP TO CREATE MORE GOOD PAYING JOBS IN AMERICA, DOES IT REASON COMES, DOES IT RAISE OUR NATIONAL SECURITY? I THINK ARE ENOUGH ON ANSWER QUESTIONS. IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT TO TRY TO BRING THESE COUNTRIES TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH AN AGREEMENT, I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, INCLUDING THEY CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET CURRENCY INTO THE AGREEMENT AND IT IS ONLY A SIDE AGREEMENT, I OPPOSED IT. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN THOUGH IS WE HAVE BEEN DOING SO LITTLE BECAUSE OF REPUBLICAN OPPOSITION, MOSTLY, MOSTLY, TO BETTER TRAIN AND PREPARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN EITHER SIDELINED OR WRAPPED UP BY THEIR HEAD FROM GLOBALIZATION. GLOBALIZATION IS REAL, WE DO NOT HAVE A GOOD TRAINING PROGRAM, WE DO NOT HAVE THE KIND OF SUPPORT PEOPLE NEED TO MOVE INTO POSITIONS WHERE THEY CAN ACQUIRE NEW SKILLS. I SEE THOSE THOSE TWO THINGS IS GOING TOGETHER. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO FIRST AND FOREMOST FOCUS ON HOW WE BETTER PREPARE MORE AMERICANS TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. I DO NOT NOT THINK WE HAVE DONE THAT. I WANT TO SEE THAT DONE ALONGSIDE ANY TRIED AGREEMENT TO STRENGTHEN THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN WILLING TO SUPPORT IT. >> MADAM SECRETARY, AMY BONDURANT. SO IMPORTANTLY YOU HAVE RECOMMENDED THE U.S. LEAD THE AIR COALITION. I WONDERED WHAT NEXT STEPS MIGHT BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT WHAT HAPPENED? >> WELL AMY, THERE IS NOTHING MAGIC OR EASY ABOUT PUTTING TOGETHER SUCH A COALITION. I KNOW PRESIDENTS AROUND WILL BE COMING TO THE STATES TO SEE PRESIDENT OBAMA THIS WEEK. I ASSUME THERE'LL BE A GROUP OF DEFENSE OFFICIALS, INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS, HOMELAND SECURITY OFFICIALS, THAT WILL BE MEETING WITH THEIR AMERICAN COUNTERPARTS. ON THE DEFENSE SIDE I THINK CERTAINLY THE UNITED STATES WORKING WITH FRANCE AND FROM THAT SORT OF HUBBUB BEGINNING TO REACH OUT TO OTHER COUNTRIES TO SEEK OUT OTHER SUPPORT. I I WOULD GO BACK TO ARAB COUNTRIES AS WELL. SO LOOKING FOR A WAY TO BEGIN THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT LEAD TO THE COALITION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. GOING BACK TO LIBYA, THE EUROPEANS WERE THE ONES WHO WANTED AMERICANS SUPPORT AND WE DID NOT AGREE TO DO SO UNTIL WE HAD A VERY CLEAR IDEA WHAT THEY WERE WILLING TO DO. THEN WE REACH OUT AND WORKED WITH THE ARAB LEAGUE SO THERE WOULD BE AIR PARTNERS AS WELL. THAT TOOK WEEKS. IT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED OVERNIGHT. BUT IT IS DEFINITELY DOABLE IF WE BEGIN WITH THE FRENCH-AMERICAN POSITION AND MOVE OUT FROM THERE. >> CARRIE WHITNEY. MY UNDERSTANDING IS WITH REGARD TO U.S. SUPPORTED SYRIA REBELS OVER THE LAST YEAR TO ONE OF THE MAIN RESTRAINTS AS THEY DID NOT FIGHT ASIDE DIRECTLY. IF THIS IS A SEVERE LIMITATION A PART OF THE PLANT THAT DID NOT WORK. WHEN YOU RECOMMEND SUPPORTING ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR SYRIAN REBEL GROUPS, WOULD YOU ADVISE THEM TO FIGHT ASIDE OR IS THAT A PART OF A CONFLICT WE DON'T WANT TO GET INTO? >> BACK IN THE FIRST TERM WHEN DAVE PATRICE AND I MADE OUR RECOMMENDATION ON VETTING AND ARMING SYRIAN MODERATE REBELS THE TARGET WAS A SIDE ASIDE. IT WAS TO PREVENT THE MILITARY TAKING OVER TERRITORY AND CREATING THE TYPE OF HUMANITARIAN DISASTER THAT WE NOW SEE. THAT IS WHAT WE RECOMMENDED IN THE FIRST TERM. SINCE THEN, I KNOW IT HAS BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT TASK FOR OUR GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ON AND PURSUE SUCCESSFULLY, BUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES HAS BEEN TRYING TO DRAW LINES. IF YOU DRAW THE LINES BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO VET AND FOLLOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ARMS THAT YOU ARE EQUIPPING PEOPLE WITH. BUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH SOME OF THE FEW GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN TRAINED IS THAT THEY WERE QUICKLY OVERRUN BY MUCH MORE HARDENED FIGHTERS WHO WERE FIGHTING ASIDE.  WAS A VERY HARD TASK TO DO TWO OR THREE YEARS LATER. I THINK IT MIGHT'VE BEEN BUT I I AM SAD I CANNOT PREDICT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE HAD MOVED EARLIER. IT MAY HAVE WORK, IT MAY HAVE NOT WORK. YOU CANNOT YOU  AFFILIATES. THEY TAKE CONTROL OF DAMASCUS AND ESTABLISH A DEMOCRACY IN SYRIA. ISN'T THAT KIND OF A TALL ORDER. >> CERTAINLY DESCRIBED LIKE THAT. THAT IS WHY I FOCUSED ON ISIS. I THINK RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ONE OVERRIDING GOAL. AS I OUTLINE, WE NEED TO CRUSH THEIR TERRITORIAL DOMAIN AND WE NEED TO TRY TO SECURE THE ENTIRE BORDER BETWEEN SYRIA AND TURKEY. THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL MILITARY EFFORT AT THIS POINT TO OVERTURN THE ASSAD REGIME, THAT THAT CAN ONLY HAPPEN THROUGH THE POLITICAL PROCESS. OUR EFFORT SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON ISIS. YES, THERE ARE OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS. THERE PARTICULARLY. >> NO FIGHT AGAINST -- >> WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE. WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY, PERHAPS I WANTS IT WOULD HAVE WORK. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE RUSSIANS IN PROTECTING ASIDE, THE IRANIANS AND HAS BELOW PROTECTING ASIDE, WE NEED PEOPLE TO TURN AGAINST THE COMMON ENEMY OF ISIS. THEN WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE PUT TOGETHER A POLITICAL OUTCOME THAT PROVIDES ENOUGH AUTONOMY SO THAT THE SEPARATE COMMUNITIES WITHIN SYRIA WILL BE ABLE TO RE-CREATE A SYRIAN STATE EVEN THOUGH IT IS PROBABLY UNLIKELY IT WILL BE  TERRORIST ATTACK, GOD FORBID IN THE UNITED STATES, DO YOU THINK THE PRESSURE TO SEND AMERICAN TROOPS INTO SYRIA WOULD BE UNSTOPPABLE QUESTION THAT. >> WILL, IT WAS REALLY GROW BUT I THINK BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE. AS I SAID, WE SHOULD BE SENDING MORSE VESSEL OPERATORS, WE SHOULD BE EMPOWERING OUR TRAINERS IN IRAQ. WE SHOULD BE LEADING AN AIR COALITION USING BOTH FIGHTER PLANES AND DRONES. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO BE ABLE TO REALLY DECIMATE ISIS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA. BUT WE HAVE GOT TO WORK WITH THE KURDS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO, IF IT IS POSSIBLE HOW TO HAVE A SECOND AWAKENING AND GET THE SUNNI TRIBES TO FEEL THAT IT IS THEIR FIGHT AGAIN AS THEY ONCE DID. THAT THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF POLITICAL PRESSURE BEING PUT ON BAGHDAD. INJECTING SOME LARGE CONTINGENT OF AMERICAN FORCES COMPLICATES THAT, IN, IN MY OPINION. RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO KEEP THE PRESSURE ON THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND AND GET THEM TO CHANGE THEIR PRIORITIES AND WORK TOGETHER. >> BACK TO THE NO-FLY ZONE. ARE YOU YOU ADVOCATING A NO-FLY ZONE OVER THE ENTIRE COUNTRY? OR PARTIAL NO FLY ZONE WHERE REFUGEES MAY FIND A SAFE HAVEN? IN THE EVENT OF EITHER DO FOR SEE YOU MAY BE POTENTIALLY PROVOKING THE RUSSIANS? >> I AM ADVOCATING THE SECOND. A NO-FLY ZONE PRINCIPALLY OVERT NORTHERN SYRIA, CLOSE TO THE TURKISH BORDER, CUTTING OFF THE SUPPLY LINES, TRYING TO PROVIDE SOME SAFE REFUGEES, CREATING A SAFE SPACE AWAY FROM THE BARREL BOMBS AND OTHER BOMBARDMENT BY THE SYRIANS. I WOULD CERTAINLY EXPECT TO AND HOPE TO WORK WITH THE RUSSIANS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. THE RUSSIANS HAVE, AS YOU KNOW, BEEN PRIMARILY A FOCUSED ON SIDES ENEMIES. NOT ON ISIS. I THINK THAT HAS CHANGED AND AFTER HE COMES HERE HE IS GOING TO MOSCOW TO SEE PUTIN. AS I SAID EARLIER, I THINK GETTING RUSSIA TO PLAY A ROLE IN THAT AND GETTING ASIDE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM WILL BE A RESULT OF A POLITICAL REBEL RESOLUTION WHICH SECRETARY KERRY IS UNDERTAKING RIGHT NOW BUT TO HAVE A SWATH OF TERRITORY THAT COULD BE A SAFE ZONE BOTH FOR SYRIANS SO THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO LEAVE BUT ALSO FOR HUMANITARIAN RELIEF. I THINK IT WOULD GIVE US THIS EXTRA LEVERAGE THAT I'M LOOKING FOR IN THE DIPLOMATIC PURSUIT WITH RUSSIA WITH RESPECT TO THE OUTCOME OF SYRIA. >> WE CAN TAKE ONE MORE BRIEF QUESTION. >> MY QUESTION IS AS WE LEAVE SAUDI ARABIA DO THINK THE GOALS OUTLINED IN THE MIDDLE EAST CAN BE ACHIEVED? MORE COOPERATION FROM SAUDI ARABIA AND IF NOT HOW DO YOU THINK IT CAN BE CONVINCED TO CHANGE THE COURSE QUESTION MARKS. >> I THINK THE SAUDIS ARE CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING THE GOALS. THE SAUDIS ARE NOW ENGAGED IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT SECRETARY KERRY IS LEADING, THEY ARE IN THE SAME PROCESS AS THE IRANIANS WHICH IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS HARD TO GET TO BUT FINALLY ACHIEVED. I THINK THE SAUDIS HAVE A MULTIPLE LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITIES. FIRST AND FOREMOST FOREMOST STOP IN THEIR OWN CITIZENS FROM CONTINUING THEIR FINANCING FOR EXTREMISTS. SAUDI FINANCING IS STILL A MAJOR SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR TERRORIST GROUPS INSIDE SYRIA, INSIDE-OUT ROCK. >> INCLUDING ISIS YOU THINK? >> I HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF THAT. ISIS HAS BECOME QUITE A SELF FINANCING TERRORIST NETWORK WITH THEIR VAST OF OIL AND SELLING IT ON THE BLACK MARKET WITH THEIR DESTRUCTION AND SEIZURE OF ANTIQUITIES, SELLING THAT ON THE BLACK MARKET. THEY ARE TAKING OVER MUZZLE AND RATING THE BANKS. THEY HAVE A SOURCE OF FUNDING. I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I KNOW THE SAUDI INDIVIDUALS HAVE CERTAINLY FUNDED OTHER RELATED TERRORIST GROUPS OVER TIME. ALSO EXPORTED A LOT OF THE HOBBY RADICALISM BY KICKING OUT OR SENDING OUT EMOND'S AND AND TEACHERS TO A SET OF SCHOOLS AND MOSQUES TO TEACH THAT PARTICULARLY HARSH BRAND OF ISLAM. SAUDIS HAVE A LOT THEY CAN DO TO BOTH STOP INTO HELL. THAT IS WHY SAID THEY ARE CAN LEGITIMATELY CONCERNED ABOUT A TAKEOVER IN YEMEN THAT LETS UP AGAINST THEIR BORDER. THAT IS WHY THEY CAN DO A LOT OF RESOURCES AND REESTABLISH THE GOVERNMENT. THEY THEY HAVE A LOT GOING ON THERE. I WOULD HOPE TO DRAW THEM INTO A BROADER READING INTO WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE REGION. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THE SUNNI SHIA SECRETARY AND DIVIDE IS ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE, IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THE SAUDIS NEED TO HAVE A BROADER VIEW AND LOOKING AT IRAN'S INFLUENCE INSIDE ZERO, THEIR GROIN INFLUENCE IN IRAQ AS WELL AS IN YEMEN THEY HAVE TO HELP",Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton National Security Address

IT  I TOLD HIM, YOU LOOK PRETTY  YOU HAVE TO SHOW ME HOW YOU  LET'S JUMP RIGHT INTO IT. THE JOB REPORT CAME OUT FOR OCTOBER. DO YOU -- IS THERE A NEED FOR A NEW DEAL 2.0 AND A MARGINAL PLAN THAT TARGETS THOSE MOST IN NEED, AS OPPOSED TO FOLKS WHO SAY YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING RACE-BASED, BUT IF YOU DO IT NEEDS-BASED, IT WILL IMPACT AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND LATINOS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE? WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES OF OTHERS?  FIRST OF ALL, I AM REALLY RELIEVED AND PLEASED THAT OVERALL WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS. AND I HAVE GONE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY MAKING THE POINT THAT WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME INTO OFFICE, HE INHERITED THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. AND HE DOESN'T GET THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR BAKING -- DIGGING US OUT OF THAT BIG HOLE HE WAS HANDED WHEN HE CAME IN. >>   SO IT HAS BEEN A LONG, SLOW EFFORT, WHICH THANKS TO HIM AND HIS LEADERSHIP AND MANY, MANY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, WE ARE EXACTLY WHERE ROLAND SAID WE ARE, DOWN TO 5% EMPLOYMENT -- UNEMPLOYMENT. BUT INCOMES ARE NOT RISING. WE HAVE TWO BIG PROBLEMS. ONE, WE HAD TO GET INCOMES TO GO BACK OUT. AND NUMBER TWO, WE HAVE TO GET MORE GOOD JOBS. AND WE DO HAVE, IN MY OPINION, A TARGETED EFFORT AT PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE NOT HAD THE BENEFITS OF THE RECOVERY US FAR -- THUS FAR. WE NEED, ONCE AND FOR ALL, TO HAVE A VERY BIG INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM ON OUR ROADS, BRIDGES, TUNNELS, AIRPORTS, RAIL SYSTEM WHERE WE CAN PUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO WORK. NUMBER TWO, WE NEED TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE BY BECOMING THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF THE 21ST CENTURY. THAT MEANS PUTTING UP WIND TURBINES AND INSTALLING SOLAR PANELS AND DOING ENERGY EFFICIENCY WORK AND ALL THE WORK THAT WILL ENABLE US NOT ONLY TO HAVE THE ECONOMY GROW, BUT MOVE AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS. NUMBER THREE --  WE NEED TO START INVESTING IN SMALL BUSINESS. MY PARTICULAR HOPE IS I CAN BE THE SMALL BUSINESS PRESIDENT. I WANT TO FOCUS ON WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR COUNTRY. ALL OF THOSE THINGS I THINK WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  I THINK WE HAVE TWO PROBLEMS. WHERE PEOPLE ARE FROZEN OUT, OR EQUALLY IMPORTANTLY, NOT SOUGHT OUT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERY TRAINING PROGRAM IS REFLECTIVE OF OUR POPULATION. I WANT TO PROVIDE AN APPRENTICESHIP CREDIT TO COMPANIES, TO UNIONS, TO OTHERS TO TRAIN YOUNG PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY, BUT NOT JUST YOUNG ANYMORE, ROLAND. WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS WERE MIDDLE AGE AND OLDER, AND THEY KNEW TO BE GIVEN SPECIAL ATTENTION. LABOR UNIONS ARE NOT THE PROBLEM IN MUCH OF THE SOUTH BECAUSE THEY ARE RIGHT TO WORK STATES. SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT ANYWHERE WE DO FOR STRUCTURE -- WE DO INFRASTRUCTURE, AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS MONEY IN IT, THEY MUST BE A PROGRAM FOR RECRUITING AND HIRING AND, WHERE NECESSARY, TRAINING PEOPLE FROM LESS ADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND THAT  WHEN I WAS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK, THIS IS ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES I HAD BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A LOT OF CONTRACTS, BUT SOMETIMES IT IS DIFFICULT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO KNOW HOW TO APPLY FOR THOSE CONTRACTS. SO I USED TO RUN A PROCUREMENT OUTREACH PROGRAM, AND A BIG CONFERENCE WHERE WE SOUGHT OUT SMALL BUSINESSES. AND AGAIN, WITH A SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON MINORITY AND WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES. I THINK WE HAVE TO DO THAT ALL THE TIME. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A MUCH MORE VIGOROUS EFFORT TO REACH OUT AND HELP PEOPLE, NUMBER ONE, APPLY FOR THE CONTRACTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. THERE IS, AND I AGREE WITH THIS, THERE IS A PREFERENCE AND THE LAW FOR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE MINORITY AND WOMEN OWNED. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PREFERENCE IS TRANSLATED INTO BENEFITS AND DOESN'T JUST SIT ON THE BOOKS.  100%. IN MY ADMINISTRATION, WHAT I WANT TO DO IS SET SOME GOALS AND TELL THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR ME, THIS IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO. AND IF WE REALLY MEASURE WHAT WE ARE DOING, WE CAN GET RESULTS AND WE CAN CHANGE OUTCOMES, I BELIEVE.  IF SOMEONE TELLS YOU THAT A GROUP OR A PERSON IS OUTPERFORMING EVERYBODY ELSE, YOUR QUESTION IS THE RIGHT QUESTION. ARE YOU GOING TO REWARD THAT PERSON OR BUSINESS? MY ANSWER IS YES. I THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMY, THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE ARE NOT SEIZING ON BEHALF OF COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS. AND I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY DOUBT AT ALL THAT WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE TO OPEN DOORS AND TO REBUILD THOSE LADDERS OF OPPORTUNITY. WHEN IT COMES TO BUSINESSES, SMALL BUSINESS, MINORITY AND WOMEN OWNED, I AM GOING TO BE VIGILANT AND I'M GOING TO DRIVE PEOPLE TO GET RESULTS. WHAT I LIKE ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID IS WE ARE NOT DOING THIS AS CHARITY, WE ARE DOING THIS AS BUSINESS. WHEN THEY DO WELL, WE NEED TO REWARD  YOU TALK SO FAST. AM I TALKING TOO FAST IN RESPONSE JACK A RAZOR -- RESPONSE? RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU THINK WE  I KNOW, I KNOW.  I ADVOCATED THAT TO BACK IN 2007 AND 2008, ROLAND. IN FACT, I WAS VERY UNHAPPY THAT WE DID NOT DO ENOUGH TO HELP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES SAVE THEIR HOMES. I WILL LOOK FOR WAYS TO, NUMBER ONE, STOP THE DAMAGE SO THAT WE DON'T LOSE MORE HOMES BECAUSE PEOPLE STILL HAVEN'T RECOVERED. BUT NUMBER TWO, WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK INTO THE HOME OWNERSHIP BUSINESS. AND A LOT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE RELUCTANT TO LOAN. AND THEY ARE MORE RELUCTANT TO LOAN TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN  AND I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT. I THINK THAT IS WRONG. NOW WE ARE STARTING TO SEE SOME OF THE BAD BEHAVIOR COMING FROM THE FOLKS WHO WANT TO THOSE HOMES. THEY ARE FORCING PEOPLE OUT. A BIG ARTICLE TODAY ABOUT MISLEADING PEOPLE AND FORCING THEM TO TURN OVER THEIR HOME UNDER FALSE PRETENSES. SO, YOU ARE RIGHT, WHAT HAPPENED IN 2007, 2008 IS JUST BEYOND HORRIBLE. 9 MILLION PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS. 5 MILLION LOST THEIR HOMES. AND $13 TRILLION IN FAMILY WEALTH WAS WIPED OUT, MOST OF IT IN HOMEOWNERSHIP, BUT ALSO IRAS, 401S, COLLEGE FUNDS. WE HAVE A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO DO, AND IT IS NOT ENOUGH IF JUST SOME PEOPLE RECOVER. I WANT TO DO IT I CAN TO HELP EVERYBODY RECOVER. >>   YOU KNOW, THAT IS -- I GENERALLY AGREE WITH THAT. I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFIC OF THE LEGISLATION, BUT I WILL OBVIOUSLY LOOK AT IT IMMEDIATELY. ONE, SOMETIMES CREDIT REPORTS ARE WRONG. BUT LET'S DEAL WITH THAT PROBLEM --  YES. AND THAT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. SECONDLY, I THINK A LOT OF CREDIT PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, HAVE TO DO WITH STUDENT DEBT, HAVE TO DO WITH CREDIT CARDS THAT THEY HAD TO USE IN ORDER TO STAY IN COLLEGE, IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET THEIR EDUCATION. THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS WHY I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE CREDIT REPORTS FOLLOWING YOU AROUND LIKE SOME ANCHOR THAT YOU HAVE TO CARRY WITH YOU. SO, YEAH, I WANT PEOPLE TO BE RESPONSIBLE, BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT A SECOND CHANCE. AND IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT YOU ARE DENIED A JOB THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO, AS I UNDERSTAND WORKING FOR THE BIRMINGHAM NEWSPAPER WOULD HAVE WITH YOUR CREDIT SCORE. SO WE NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THAT.  FIRST OF ALL, I DO UNDERSTAND THE SENSE OF FRUSTRATION AND DISAPPOINTMENT AND EVEN OUTRAGE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE, LIKE THOSE THAT WERE IN ATLANTA LAST WEEK, FEEL BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED. AND THEY ARE IMPATIENT, AND THEY DESERVE TO BE IMPATIENT. AND THEY DESERVE TO HEAR ANSWERS FROM PEOPLE LIKE ME RUNNING FOR OFFICE. I HAVE HAD SOME VERY GOOD, OPEN, PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT. I WISH THEY HAD LISTENED BECAUSE A LOT OF WHAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT TOGETHER ARE PART OF THE PROPOSALS WE ARE MAKING. AND THE REASON WE ROLLED THEM OUT -- AND THIS IS AN INTERESTING POINT TO MAKE TO YOU AS A LEADING MEMBER OF THE PRESS -- AS YOU GET MORE ATTENTION PAID TO THEM. IF YOU PUT THEM OUT ONE DAY, IT IS A ONE DAY STORY. SO WE HAVE BEEN ROLLING OUT, STARTING WITH THE VERY FIRST SPEECH I GAVE IN THIS CAMPAIGN BACK IN, I DON'T KNOW, MARCH OR APRIL ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP DOING THAT BECAUSE I WANT PEOPLE TO LOOK AT WHAT I AM PROPOSING. WE ARE GOING TO REDUCE MINIMUM MANDATORY SENTENCES. WE ARE FINALLY GOING TO REDUCE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POWDER AND CRACK COCAINE, WHICH HAS BEEN A TERRIBLE, UNFAIR BURDEN. WE ARE GOING TO BAN THE BOX AND LET PEOPLE APPLY FOR JOBS. AND ONLY AT THE AND COME IF THEY GET TO THAT AT BE END, IF THEY GET TO THAT END, THEY CAN TALK ABOUT WHATEVER RECORD THEY HAVE. WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST AGENDA, AND I FEEL VERY COMMITTED TO THIS TRADE AND I PARTICULARLY WANT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SHARE THE INPATIENTS AND THE DISAPPOINTMENT -- AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT GOING FORWARD, BUT I WILL SAY BACK IN THE 1990'S, THAT BILL WAS IN RESPONSE TO A HORRIFIC DECADE OF CRIME. AND LEADERS OF THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND POOR COMMUNITIES WERE IN THE FOREFRONT SAYING, YOU MUST DO SOMETHING. AND IT WAS DONE. AND IT DID HAVE A LOT OF POSITIVE, BUT ALSO NEGATIVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK. THAT IS WHAT A DEMOCRACY SHOULD  WELL, WE WANT TO GET RID -- MRS. CLINTON: WELL, WE WANT TO GET RID OF THE NONVIOLENT OFFENSES AS A WAY OF GOING INTO JAIL. BUT THIS IS LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE. IT CUTS BOTH WAYS. IF YOU REDUCE THE MANDATORY MINIMUMS, I BELIEVE THEN WE CAN SEE DOES IT REDUCE DISCRIMINATION? AND DISCRIMINATION CAN BE ON BOTH SIDES BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT NOW IS THAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED, TO BE CHARGED, TO BE CONVICTED, TO BE INCARCERATED FOR DOING THE SAME THINGS AS WHITE MEN. SO WE WANT TO REDUCE THOSE MINIMUMS, BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO OPEN THE DOOR TO A DIFFERENT FORM OF DISCRIMINATION. WE ARE LOOKING HARD AT HOW THIS WOULD BE  EQUAL PAY FOR THE SAME WORK? MRS. CLINTON: AMEN. AMEN. YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I DO NOT DO A TOWN HALL ANYWHERE IN AMERICA WITHOUT BEING ASKED THIS QUESTION. AND FOR ALL THOSE REPUBLICANS WHO SAY THIS IS NOT A REAL WORLD PROBLEM, I WISH THEY WOULD COME TO MY TOWN HALLS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE TALKING TO BECAUSE IT IS. AND I THINK -- I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS WE DO. NUMBER ONE, JUST TALKING ABOUT IT. MAKING SURE PEOPLE CAN'T IGNORE IT OR DIMINISH IT OR PRETEND IT IS SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM. BUT THEN WE HAVE TO FORCE THE LAWS -- ENFORCE THE LAWS THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE BOOKS. THIS IS NOT JUST A WOMEN'S ISSUE, THIS IS A FAMILY ISSUE. AND THE OTHER THING IS ONE OF THE THINGS -- AND YOU GOT RIGHT TO IT -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STANDS IN THE WAY OF KNOWING HOW WIDESPREAD THIS IS IS THE FACT THAT IN MANY BUSINESSES YOU CAN BE FIRED FOR ASKING SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE BUSINESS HOW MUCH THEY ARE PAID. SO A LOT OF WOMEN DON'T KNOW THEY ARE BEING PAID LESS THAN THE MEN THAT THEY ARE WORKING BESIDE, DOING THE SAME JOB. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO LILY, THE WOMAN IN ALABAMA WHO HAD WORKED IN A BIG FACTORY FOR YEARS. SHE GOT PROMOTED OK. SHE BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN FOREMAN, I GUESS, OR WOMAN FORE WOMAN, AND IT WAS ONLY BY ACCIDENT THAT SHE LEARNED ALTHOUGH THERE WERE FOUR OR FIVE MEN DURING THE EXACT SAME JOB, SHE WAS BEING PAID LESS. SO I WANT TO REMOVE ANY DOUBT THAT TRANSPARENCY IS ACCEPTABLE, AND IF THERE NEEDS TO BE CHANGES IN THE RULES OR THE LAWS ABOUT BUSINESSES SO THAT THEY CANNOT RETALIATE, SO THAT YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW MATURE ARE BEING PAID SO YOU CAN COMPARE YOUR PAY TO OTHER WORKERS IN THE SAME SITUATION, I WILL TELL YOU A REALLY QUICK TORRY, A YOUNG MAN CAME UP TO ME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SAID -- HE WAS IN HIS MID TO LATE 20'S -- HE SAID HIS FIRST REAL JOB WAS WORKING AT A CASHIER AT THE SAME STORE HIS MOTHER WORKED IN. HE WAS 17 AND HE WAS SO PROUD BECAUSE THIS WAS LIKE HIS FIRST JOB, AND HE GOT IT BECAUSE HIS MOTHER INTRODUCED HIM TO SOMEBODY. HE COMES HOME WITH HIS FIRST PAYCHECK. HIS MOTHER LOOKS AT IT AND HER FACE FALLS. SHE TELLS HIM YOU ARE MAKING A DOLLAR MORE AN HOUR THAN I AM AND I HAVE BEEN THERE FOR YEARS. SO HE WENT TO FIND OUT. AND THE MANAGER SAID, WELL, YEAH, YOU ARE A YOUNG MAN. WE THINK YOU HAVE A LOT OF POTENTIAL TO GO UP IN THE BUSINESS. SO WE ARE GOING TO TACKLE THIS AND WE ARE GOING TO END IT ONCE AND FOR ALL.  YOUR LIPS TO GOD'S YEARS, RIGHT? -- EARS, RIGHT? >> WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE AND MOST OF THE SOUTHERN STATES AND THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES --  WITH GUNS. AND WE KNOW THE NRA IS JUST ADAMANT ABOUT NOT DOING ANYTHING TO DO AWAY WITH THESE GUNS. BUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO FIND WHAT WILL YOU DO TO GET RID OF ALL THESE GUNS THAT ARE ON THE STREETS THAT ARE IN THE HOMES THAT ARE INADVERTENTLY KILLING YOUNGSTERS IN THEIR HOMES? WHAT WILL YOU DO TO HELP US OUT WITH THAT?  THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I JUST THINK WE HAVE GOT TO ADDRESS. I UNDERSTAND HOW POLITICALLY CHALLENGING IT IS. 90 PEOPLE A DAY DIE IN OUR COUNTRY FROM GUNS. HOMICIDES, SUICIDES, AND AVOIDABLE ACCIDENTS, LIKE WHAT THE GENTLEMAN WAS REFERRING TO. AND IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT PEOPLE MAKE THIS A VOTING ISSUE. I KNOW WE CAN BALANCE THE LEGITIMATE RIGHTS OF GUN OWNERS WITH THE RIGHT TO BE SAFE GOING TO SCHOOL ARE GOING TO CHURCH. THE RIGHT TO HAVE CONTROL OVER WHAT HAPPENS IN PEOPLE GOING TO STORES TO BUY GUNS WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM. SO HERE IS WHAT I AM PROPOSING. NUMBER ONE, WE NEED UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR REAL. WE NEED TO CLOSE THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE. WE NEED TO CLOSE THE ONLINE LOOPHOLE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE BUYING GUNS AND AMMUNITION ONLINE. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE, AND WE KNOW SOME OF THE MASS MURDERERS, THAT IS HOW THEY GOT WHAT THEY USED TO KILL PEOPLE. WE NEED TO CLOSE WHAT IS CALLED THE CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE. THE CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE IS, UNFORTUNATELY, WHAT ENABLED THAT YOUNG MAN TO GET A GUN HE WAS NOT ENTITLED TO. HE WAS A FELON. HE HAD A FELONY CONVICTION. BUT UNDER THE RULES, THREE BUSINESS DAYS IS ALL YOU GET TO FIND OUT. AND THE INFORMATION HADN'T BEEN SHARED BETWEEN TWO JURISDICTIONS, SO AFTER THREE DAYS, HE WENT AND HE GOT THAT GONE AND HE WENT TO MOTHER EMMANUEL AND HE MURDERED THOSE NINE WONDERFUL PEOPLE. AND THEN WE NEED TO REMOVE THE IMMUNITY THAT GUN MAKERS AND SELLERS HAVE. THEY ARE THE ONLY INDUSTRY IN AMERICA THAT WE GIVE BLANKET IMMUNITY TO. GUN MAKERS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO APPLY TECHNOLOGY THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS SO THAT GUNS OWNED BY RESPONSIBLE ADULTS CANNOT BE OPERATED BY CHILDREN, OR IF THEY ARE STOLEN, CANNOT BE USED BY CRIMINALS. AND WHAT I AM JUST APPALLED AT THE NUMBERS OF YOUNG CHILDREN -- I'M TALKING TODDLERS -- TO GO INTO A CLOSET OR GO UNDER A BAD OR OPEN A DRAWER -- BED OR OPEN MARRIAGE OR AN THERE IS A GUN. AND THEY KILL THEMSELVES, THEY KILL THEIR SIBLINGS, THEY KILL THEIR FRIENDS, THEY INJURE PEOPLE. THAT IS CRAZY, MY FRIENDS. I KNOW THE NRA ARE POWERFUL, BUT I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE MORE POWERFUL. AND THE RIGHT TO LIFE  I HAVE WHAT IS CALLED, ROLAND, MY NEW COLLEGE COMPACT. IT WOULD AFFECT BOTH STATE AND CLASS IN THIS WAY. IF YOU ARE GOING TO A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY, YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO BORROW MONEY TO PAY FOR TUITION, AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO USE YOUR POWER GRANT, IF YOU -- PELL GRANT, IF YOU GET ONE, FOR LIVING EXPENSES. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE OR YOUNG PEOPLE TO GO TO COLLEGE, FINISH COLLEGE, AND GRADUATE WITHOUT THAT THAT. THAT WILL HELP THE PUBLIC HBCU'S BECAUSE THEY WILL CERTAINLY BE INCLUDED. I HAVE A SPECIAL PROVISION OF A POT OF $25 BILLION FOR HBCU'S, INCLUDING PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS, THE COUSIN I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH WHAT ROLAND SAID. THESE ARE THE PLACES THAT GRADUATE BLACK PROFESSIONALS. AND WE NEED TO MORE, NOT FEWER. AND I WILL REVERSE THE IMPACT OF THE LOAD CHANGES.  YES. FIRST OF ALL, MY PLAN WILL MEAN THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY. BUT FOR THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DROPPED OUT, WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THEM BACK IN. >>   I KNOW HOW CONTROVERSIAL TRADE HAS BEEN IN SOUTH CAROLINA, AND SOUTH CAROLINA IS A CLASSIC CASE OF WINNERS AND LOSERS BECAUSE OF TRADE. A LOT OF THOSE JOBS, NOT JUST THROUGH NAFTA, BUT THROUGH DIFFERENCES IN COST OF PRODUCTION WENT TO ASIA AS WELL. SO I DON'T FEEL WE CAN BLAME THE LOSS OF THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY ON NAFTA. I THINK IT WAS BROADER THAN THAT. NAFTA MAY HAVE OPENED THE DOOR MORE WIDELY FOR JOBS TO GO TO MEXICO, BUT TEXTILE JOBS WERE UNDER GLOBAL PRESSURE, EVEN WITHOUT NAFTA. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN BECAUSE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATION IS THAT SOUTH CAROLINA HAS ATTRACTED A GREAT NUMBER OF CAR COMPANIES, MORE ADVANCED MANUFACTURING COMPANIES? SO IT IS KIND OF A NEWS-BAD NEWS STORY. WHAT I WANT TO DO IS MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO RECRUIT INTERNALLY WITHIN UNITED STATES AND EXTERNALLY FROM ABROAD MORE JOBS -- AND I'M NOT SURE WE CAN GET TEXTILE JOBS BACK UNLESS THEY ARE MORE SOPHISTICATED, RECORDING HIGHER LEVELS OF EXPERTISE IN THE DYING AND THE PRINTING AND WHATEVER ELSE IS REQUIRED -- BUT I DO THINK WE CAN GET MORE ADVANCED MANUFACTURING JOBS BACK IF WE PROVIDE MORE TAX CREDIT AND MORE TECH-SUPPORT. IF WE DO WHAT I SAID AT THE VERY BEGINNING, HAVE MORE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS SO WE ARE TRAINING OUR WORKFORCE RIGHT HERE AT HOME. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IS ONE OF OUR BIGGEST ADVANTAGES IN ANY MEASUREMENT OF HOW WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL. AND I HAVE BEEN TO A GOOD COMMUNITY COLLEGE OUTSIDE OF CHARLESTON, WHICH IS DOING THESE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. BUT LET ME JUST SAY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET THOSE JOBS BACK UNLESS WE HAVE SKILLED WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO DO THEM. AND THAT IS WHERE EDUCATION COMES IN. BECAUSE WE HAVE STILL TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO DO THE ADVANCED MANUFACTURING. SO I WANT A NATIONWIDE EFFORT PAID BUT THE FOCUS ON POORER STATES, LIKE SOUTH CAROLINA, TO DO MORE IN A KIND OF, AS YOU ARE SAYING, A NEW NEW DEAL OR TRAINING PROGRAM SO WE ACTUALLY TAKE SERIOUSLY THE IDEA WE CAN GET AND KEEP THESE JOBS. IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS I CAME OUT AGAINST THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP BILL BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TRADE. WE ARE 5% OF THE WORLDS POPULATION. WE HAVE TO BUILD THINGS AND SELL THINGS TO THE OTHER 95%. PEOPLE WHO ARE AGAINST TRADE NO MATTER WHAT I THINK ARE KIND OF MISSING THE POINT. WE NEED SMART TRADE AND FAIR TRADE AND AFFECTIVE TRADE. AND WE NEED TO EXIT WITH TAKING -- WE NEED TO MIX IT WITH TAKING CARE OF OUR OWN PEOPLE. IF YOU OPEN THE DOOR TO TRADE, WHICH I AM ALL FOR, YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY WHO ARE ABLE TO COMPETE FOR THOSE JOBS. THE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT FOR JOB TRAINING, THEY ARE NOT FOR RESCALING THE WORKFORCE. THEY DON'T WANT TO SPEND ANY MONEY ON THAT. AND I'M HOLDING OUT TO SAY, OK, WE CAN DO TRADE, BUT WE CAN ONLY DO TRADE THAT IS GOING TO BENEFIT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACROSS THE BOARD IF WE INVEST IN OUR OWN PEOPLE AND WE GIVE THEM THE SKILLS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL. MR. MARTIN: QUESTION. >>   ACTUALLY, I PROPOSE THAT. I WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO PROPOSE THAT WHEN I GAVE A SPEECH AT SOUTHERN TEXAS UNIVERSITY. AND THE REASON I POSTED IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE STRONGLY -- I PROPOSED IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BE REGISTERED WHEN THEY TURN 18. FOR LEGAL REASONS, THEY CAN OPT OUT OF THAT, BUT I DON'T THINK THE MAJORITY WHAT. YOU RAISE A MUCH BIGGER POINT. YOU KNOW, WHEN THE SUPREME COURT -- AND THESE ARE MY WORDS -- GUARDED THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT -- GUTTING THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT BY REJECTING THE CONGRESS WE -- REAUTHORIZING IT, AND I WAS IN THE SENATE TO THEN, WE VOTED TO BE AUTHORIZE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. THE SUPREME COURT WAS BASICALLY SENDING A MESSAGE TO POLITICAL LEADERS THAT THEY COULD BEGIN TO TRY TO FIND NEW WAYS TO INTERFERE WITH THE RIGHT TO VOTE. THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THEIR INTENTION, BUT THAT HAS BEEN THE RESULT. -- SO ALL THESE PHOTO ID --  YOU KNOW -- WE DO NOT HAVE A PROBLEM OF ANY MAGNITUDE WHATSOEVER. OUR PROBLEM IS NOT PEOPLE ILLEGALLY TRYING TO VOTE. OUR PROBLEM IS THAT LEGAL FOLKS ARE NOT DOING WHAT THEY SHOULD DEVOTE TO MAKE SURE THEIR VOICES ARE HEARD -- SHOULD TO VOTE TO MAKE SURE THEIR VOICES ARE HEARD. I AM GOING TO KEEP TAKING IT ON, AND I THINK THE SUPREME COURT WAS ABSOLUTELY WRONG. THERE IS LEGISLATION NOW BEING PROMOTED IN -- PROPOSED IN THE CONGRESS TO UNDO THE DAMAGE. BUT IN THE MEANTIME, WE NEED TO HAVE POLITICAL ACTION, LITIGATION, MOBILIZATION AGAINST THESE EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS THE VOTE. WHY ARE THEY DOING THAT? THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THEY DON'T WANT TO VOTE. ALABAMA PASSED A VOTER ID BILL. AND IF THEY SAID, OK, ONE OF THE VOTER IDS YOU CAN USE IS A DRIVERS LICENSE WITH HER PICTURE ON IT. I DON'T BELIEVE THEY ARE NECESSARY, BUT OK, YOU CAN USE A VOTER ID THAT WAY. THEN JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO, THEY PASSED A BILL AND THE GOVERNOR ASKED TO SHUT DOWN THE MOTOR VEHICLE OFFICES IN THE COUNTY'S THAT HAVE THE BIGGEST -- COUNTIE S THAT HAVE THE BIGGEST BLACK POPULATIONS. I SPENT 18 WONDERFUL YEARS IN ARKANSAS AND I LEARNED A LOT. AND ONE OF MY  I HAVE, FOR MANY YEARS NOW, ABOUT 30 YEARS, SUPPORTED THE IDEA OF CHARTER SCHOOLS. BUT NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, BUT AS A SUPPLEMENT FOR THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. >>   AND WHAT I HAVE -- WHAT I HAVE WORKED ON THROUGH MY WORK WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND AND MY WORK AND EDUCATION IN ARKANSAS AND THROUGH MY TIME AS FIRST LADY AND SENATOR IS TO CONTINUE TO SAY CHARTER SCHOOLS CAN HAVE A PURPOSE, BUT THERE ARE GOOD CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THERE ARE BAD CHARTER SCHOOLS. JUST LIKE THERE ARE GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THERE  BUT THE ORIGINAL IDEA, ROLAND, WAS TO LEARN WHAT WORKED AND THEN APPLY THEM IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. HERE IS A COUPLE OF PROBLEMS. MOST CHARTER SCHOOLS -- I DO WANT TO SEE EVERYONE ONE -- MOST CHARTER SCHOOLS DON'T TAKE THE HARDEST TO TEACH KIDS. OR IF THEY DO, THEY DON'T KEEP THEM. AND SO THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE OFTEN IN A NO-WIN SITUATION BECAUSE THEY DO, THANKFULLY, TAKE EVERYBODY. AND THEN THEY DON'T GET THE RESOURCES AND HELP AND SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF EVERY CHILD'S EDUCATION. SO I WANT PARENTS TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE CHOICE WITHIN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. NOT OUTSIDE OF IT. BUT WITHIN IT BECAUSE I AM STILL A FIRM BELIEVER THAT THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE REAL PILLARS OF OUR DEMOCRACY. AND IT IS A PATH FOR OPPORTUNITY. BUT I AM ALSO FULLY AWARE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF SUBSTANDARD PUBLIC SCHOOLS. BUT PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT POLICYMAKERS AND LOCAL POLITICIANS WILL NOT FUND SCHOOLS IN POOR AREAS THAT TAKE CARE OF POOR CHILDREN TO THE LEVEL THAT THEY NEED TO DO. AND YOU COULD GET ME GOING ON THIS BECAUSE THE CORRIDOR OF SHAME RIGHT HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA, YOU GET ON THEIR AND YOU CAN SEE SCHOOLS -- THERE AND YOU CAN SEE SCHOOLS THAT ARE LITERALLY FALLING APART. I HAVE SEEN THE TERRIBLE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS. IT IS AN OUTRAGE. TO SEND ANY CHILD TO A SCHOOL THAT YOU WOULDN'T SEND YOUR OWN CHILD TO. AND SO, WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS SERVE PEOPLE, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE ALSO PROVIDE OPTIONS WITHIN THE SYSTEM SO THAT PARENTS CAN FIND WHAT THEY THINK MIGHT WORK BEST FOR THEIR KID.  LET ME SAY THIS ABOUT STUDENT DEBT. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO REFINANCE EVERYBODY'S STUDENT DEBT SO YOU WILL SAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE TO PAY BACK WILL BE MANAGEABLE FOR YOU. WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW IS YOUNG PEOPLE GRADUATE WITH ALL THIS DEBT AND YOU OFTEN HAVE TO GO INTO THE WORKFORCE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PAY BACK. I WANT TO PUT IN AND DATE TO THE DEBT. YOU BEEN VIGILANT AND DILIGENT PAYING IT BACK, I WANTED AND DATE. I WANT THEM TO HAVE THE OPTION TO GO INTO -- CONTINGENCY REPAYMENT PROGRAMS LIKE I AND MY HUSBAND HAD. WE HAD LOANS THAT WE GET THE PAINT AS A PERCENTAGE OF INCOME, NOT A FIXED INTEREST RATE. WE NEED TO GET THE COST OF STUDENT DEBT DOWN. WE NEED TO GET THE PAY OF PEOPLE IN THE WORKFORCE UP. IT IS NOT GOING UP. THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST POINTS I MADE. WE HAVE RECOVERED MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF JOBS. WE'RE DOWN TO 5% UNEMPLOYMENT. BUT PAY HAS NOT YET BEEN RISING. WE HAVE GOT TO DO MORE TO GET PAID TO GO UP. THERE ARE ALL THESE THINGS TO DO LIKE RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND THAT USUALLY HAS AN UPWARD IMPACT ON WAGES GOING UP THE SCALE. I WANT MORE COMPANIES TO ENGAGE IN PROFIT SHARING BECAUSE THEIR EMPLOYEES HELPED TO CREATE THE PROPHETS ANNOUNCING THEM GO NOT JUST TO THE TOP. WE WILL CLOSE LOOPHOLES AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING HUGE SALARIES PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE IN TAXES. WE ARE GOING TO GO AFTER THE PROBLEM OF WAGES NOT RISING CITY CAN GET YOUR DEBT DOWN AND  REQUEST AND -- GREAT QUESTION. I BELIEVE IN THE PROGRAM. AGAIN, IT IS SOMETHING THE DEMOCRATS OF HAD TO DEFEND AGAINST REPUBLICAN ATTACKS FOR DECADES. THERE ARE GOOD EXAMPLES OF IT WORKING BUT INCREASINGLY IN LATER YEARS IT HAS NOT. THERE ARE TWO APPROACHES. ONE, THE TREASURY AND THE BANK REGULATORS NEED TO ENSURE THAT BANKS ARE MEETING THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT. THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD PROGRAMS WE CAN POINT TO. IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, WE CAN SHOW THEM WHAT TO DO TO CREATE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. SECONDLY, YOU MENTIONED SURE BANK. IN ARKANSAS I HELPED START THE ARKANSAS DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION BECAUSE I THINK IN ADDITION TO GETTING CONVENTIONAL BANKS TO DO THEY CAN WE NEED MORE OF THESE DEVELOPMENT BANKS LIKE SOUTH SHORE AND WHAT WE DID IN ARKANSAS HAS HAD A REAL POSITIVE EFFECT. THE FINAL THING I WILL SAY ABOUT THIS IS THERE IS A BIG FIGHT GOING ON IN WASHINGTON ABOUT THE DODD FRANK BILL AND THE RULES IN PLACE OF THE BANKING COMMUNITY PRIMARILY INTO THE BIGGEST BANKS THAT WERE CONTRIBUTORS TO SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAD LIKE THE MORTGAGE AND OTHER PROBLEMS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. A LOT OF COMMUNITY BANKS SAY HEY, THOSE RULES FELL ON US TO. WHICH IS A -- WE ARE JUST A SMALL REGIONAL BANK. WITHOUT GIVING ANY RELIEF TO THE BIG BANKS, BECAUSE I THINK THEY NEED TO BE REGULATED SO DON'T GET US IN TROUBLE AGAIN, I WANT TO PROVIDE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITY BANKS TO BE ABLE TO ONCE MORE BE PART PARTNERS -- BE PARTNERS IN THE COMMITTEE.  HE WAS DURING THE GREAT RECESSION.  I BELIEVE THE STATES ARE TAKING THIS STEP. THERE IS A GREAT PHRASE ATTRIBUTE TO ROOSEVELT THAT STATES ARE LABORATORIES OF DEMOCRACY. I WANT TO SEE HOW IT WORKS BEFORE WE SEE A NATIONAL PLAN BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT FOR US TO LEARN. WHAT I DO WANT IS FOR US TO SUPPORT RESEARCH INTO MEDICAL MARIJUANA BECAUSE A LOT MORE STATES HAVE PASSED MIRKO -- MEDICAL MARIJUANA THAT LEGALIZED MARIJUANA. WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES OR EXPERIMENTS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. THE PROBLEM WITH MEDICAL MARIJUANA IS THAT THERE IS A LOT OF ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE ABOUT HOW WELL IT WORKS FOR CERTAIN CONDITIONS BUT WE HAVE NOT DONE ANY RESEARCH. WHY? IT'S CONSIDERED A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG AND HE CAN'T EVEN DO RESEARCH ON IT. I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE IT FROM WHAT IS CALLED SCHEDULE ONE TO SCHEDULE TWO SO RESEARCHERS CAN START RESEARCHING WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO USE IT. HOW MUCH DOES TO SOME OF YOU NEED? HOW DOES IT INTERACT WITH OTHER MEDICATIONS? IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF STATES SETTING UP MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES SO THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOME KIND OF MEDICAL NEED ARE GETTING MARIJUANA, WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE QUALITY OF IT. HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU TAKE? WHAT SHOULD YOU AVOIDED TAKING OTHER MEDICATIONS. THAT IS HOW I AM CURRENTLY THINKING ABOUT IT.  WILL YOU PUSH FOR MAJOR MEDICAL INCREASE IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR A CURE  YES I WILL. SICKLE CELL -- HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW SOME WAY WITH SICKLE CELL? OH MY GOSH. IS A DEVASTATING DISEASE. I HAVE SEVERAL -- I KNOW SEVERAL PEOPLE -- THE OTHER DAY, ACTUALLY IT WAS LAST WEEK I WAS AT THE NAACP BANQUET IN CHARLESTON AND A YOUNG WOMAN IN HIGH SCHOOL GAVE A TRIBUTE. AND THEN SHE CAME OVER TO TALK TO ME. SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH SICKLE CELL WHEN SHE WAS A VERY YOUNG CHILD. SHE HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE HOSPITAL IN AUGUST TO THE MEDICAL CENTER IN CHARLESTON TO GET TRANSFUSIONS EVERY MONTH. I HAVE ANOTHER FRIEND, A YOUNG LAWYER WHO HAS SICKLE CELL AND SHE IS REALLY SMART AND SHE WORKS REALLY HARD AND YES TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. -- AND SHE HAS TO GO INTO THE HOSPITAL. YES, I THINK WE NEED TO PUT MORE MONEY, TIME, EFFORT INTO HOW WE WILL FINALLY AIR AND AND SICKLE CELL ANEMIA.  THE QUESTION?  THAT IS SUCH A GREAT QUESTION. LET'S GET THIS YOUNG MAN A ROUND OF APPLAUSE.   I DID. I TOLD HIM I WAS A SCOUT. I WAS A GIRL SCOUT THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL. I LEARNED A LOT. IN ADDITION TO THE LITTLE MERIT BADGE THINGS YOU LEARN, WHICH HE'S GOT SOME OF HIS MERIT BADGES ON HIS UNIFORM, I LEARNED ABOUT TEAMWORK. I LEARNED ABOUT COOPERATING WITH OTHER PEOPLE. HAVEN'T HOW IMPORTANT IT IS WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING YOU EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO KEEP YOUR WORD AND DO IT. I LEARNED ABOUT HOW SCOUTING HAS FOR SO MANY DECADES HELPED YOUNG WOMEN AND YOUNG MEN LEARN THINGS THEY MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE NORMED. -- LEARNED. MY FAMILY WAS ON A CAMPING FAMILY. WE DROVE EVERY YEAR FROM CHICAGO TO PENNSYLVANIA TO SEE MY GRANDPARENTS. WE SLEPT IN THE CAR. WE WERE NOT INTO THE FOREST IN THE WOODS AND ALL OF THAT. I LEARNED SPECIFIC THINGS AS WELL AS GENERAL VALUES AND CHARACTER TRAITS THAT I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR EVERYBODY TO LEARN, BUT WHICH SCOUTING IS MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE  THE ANSWER IS YES. WHAT I SAID A FEW WEEKS AGO WAS THERE ARE CERTAINLY SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS WITH THE VA AND THEY SHOULD BE FIXED AND IT'S AN OUTRAGE. IF  ANYBODY HAS BEEN MISTREATED OR LEFT UNTREATED BY THE V.A., BUT I BELIEVE THEY HAVE DONE GOOD THINGS. THE REPUBLICANS ARE ALWAYS TRY TO PRIVATIZE EVERYTHING. PRIVATIZE EDUCATION, SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE, AND PRIVATIZE THE V,.A. I WILL APPOINT SOMEBODY WITH MANAGEMENT'S PARENTS WHO WILL BEAT OUT THOSE THAT ARE OUTSOURCED OF EITHER. TAKE WHAT IS GOOD ABOUT THE THE A IN MAKE SURE IT'S AVAILABLE TO ALL OF OUR VETERANS. THAT IS OUR GOAL.  THAT'S A FAIR  IT IS A FAIR POINT BECAUSE POVERTY IS DEBILITATING NO MATTER WHERE IT HAPPENS OR WHO IT AFFECTS. THERE IS SUCH A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING IN OUR COUNTRY ABOUT THE NUMBER OF FOR WHITE FOLKS. WE JUST HAD A STEADY AMOUNT -- STUDY COME OUT THIS SAID POOR WHITE MIDDLE-AGED AMERICANS WITHOUT A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION ARE DYING THAT A HIGHER RATE THAN THEY DID THAT HAVE EVER DONE BEFORE. ALCOHOLISM, ADDICTION, SUICIDE. POVERTY IS POVERTY. THERE IS A GREAT IDEA TO COMMERCE AND JIM CLYBURN HAS PUT FORWARD CALL 102030. 10% OF FEDERAL FUNDS WOULD GO TO COMMUNITIES WHERE 20% OF THE PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN POVERTY AND HAVE DONE SO FOR MORE THAN 30  AND PREDOMINATELY WHITE. AS HE POINTED OUT TO ME, THIS WOULD BE A RECIPE FOR DEALING WITH POVERTY EVERYWHERE BASED ON THE NUMBERS. IF YOU'RE LIVING IN AN IMPOVERISHED GENERATIONAL SITUATION, THEN YOU NEED HELP AND THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE TURNING ITS BACK ON YOU. I AM IN FAVOR OF EMPOWERMENT. ONE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT MY HUSBAND PUT INTO PLACE, THE NEW MARKETS TAX CREDIT WAS USED TO HELP BUILD UP POOR RURAL COMMUNITIES, TO PROVIDE FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. IT HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO LAST LETTER REPUBLICAN CONGRESS. THERE ARE TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL. THE POINT YOU MAKE IS WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT THIS SO THE CARICATURES AND THE STEREOTYPES THAT ARE TOO OFTEN FLOODING THE MEDIA ARE ONCE AND FOR ALL RETIRED.  WE WENT TO APPALACHIA AS WELL. THE DELTA AND APPALACHIA. LET ME POINT OUT THAT A LOT OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ARE NOT EXPANDING MEDICAID, INCLUDING HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. THAT IS LEAVING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF POOR PEOPLE, BLACK AND WHITE, JUST TO THE MERCY OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM. THERE IS NO SYSTEM FOR THEM TO THE ELITE OF THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED. IF YOU COMPARE, AND I WAS IN LOUISIANA NOT SO LONG AGO, THE PRIOR DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR IN ARKANSAS EXPANDED MEDICAID. GOT A SPECIAL WAIVER FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO IT IN A WAY HE COULD GET THROUGH HIS LEGISLATURE. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF POOR ARKANSAMNS GOT IT. IN LOUISIANA THEY WOULD NOT DO IT SO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE LEFT OUT. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU JUSTIFY THAT, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS PAYING 100% OF THE COST UNTIL IN A FEW YEARS IT WILL TAKE 90% OF THE COST. WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE WELL. YOU TALK ABOUT THIS RECENT STUDY I MENTIONED WHERE YOU HAVE MIDDLE-AGED WHITE FOLKS KILLING THEMSELVES, GETTING ADDICTED TO DRUGS AND ALCOHOL, NOT GETTING HELP FROM MENTAL ILLNESS OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE. THAT IS A HEALTH PROBLEM. PEOPLE ARE OFTEN TIMES IN RURAL AREAS NOT AS REACHABLE THROUGH HEALTH SYSTEMS. I THINK WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT DO WE DO TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY HEALTHIER AND THE PEOPLE MOST IN NEED OF THAT ARE POOR PEOPLE. WHEREVER THEY LIVE IN WHOEVER THEY ARE. I FEEL PASSIONATELY ABOUT THIS. MY FIRST JOB WAS WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. MY FIRST JOB FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND IS COMING TO SOUTH CAROLINA TO DO AN INVESTIGATION ABOUT JUVENILES AND ADULT JAILS. SOUND FAMILIAR? WE MAKE PROGRESS BUT THEN WE KIND OF FALL BACK. YOU CANNOT GROW WEARY DOING THE WORK THAT IS NECESSARY TO HELP PEOPLE HAVE DIGNITY AND DEVELOP THEIR OWN POTENTIAL. THAT IS WHAT HEALTH IS ABOUT. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT, YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.  DO WE HAVE SOME CANDIDATES HERE? I WILL CERTAINLY CONSIDER PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE ENERGY AND THE INTELLECT AND THE EXPERIENCE TO BE ON THE SUPREME COURT. PROBABLY ON THE YOUNGER SIDE BECAUSE OF WANT THEM TO BE THERE  YES, I DO.  THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN ONE OF THE BIBLES, I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU DO BECAUSE IT'S SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY PART OF SOUTH CAROLINA HISTORY. AS YOU CAN TELL MY HUSBAND WOULD BE JEALOUS. WHICH IS OK. LOOK, I THINK YOU HAVE TO START WITH THE FAMILIES AND THE PARENTS OF LITTLE CHILDREN. I WANT TO DO MORE THROUGH COMMUNITIES, THROUGH CHURCHES, THE OTHER INSTITUTIONS TO HELP EVERY PARENT UNDERSTAND THAT HE AND SHE ARE A CHILD'S FIRST TEACHER. ENTITY WILL BE NO CAN WORK -- AND TO DO WHAT WE KNOW CAN WORK TO GET THE CHILD PREPARED FOR SCHOOL. OPPORTUNITY IS NOT UNIVERSAL. THERE ARE A LOT OF REALLY SMART KIDS WHO DON'T GET THE CHANCES THEY DESERVE. THAT'S WHY WE NEED UNIVERSAL PREKINDERGARTEN BECAUSE WE NEED TO START WITH KIDS THAT DESERVE THE EXTRA HELP. WHEN THEY GET THE SCHOOL THEY ARE BETTER PREPARED TO LEARN. I THINK WHAT YOU ARE SAYING MAKES SENSE AND IS LIKE TO THE POINT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER ABOUT SCHOOLS. WHEN I WAS FIRST LADY OF ARKANSAS WE GET A VERY COMPREHENSIVE OVERHAUL OF OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM. CHANGING THE CURRICULUM, PUTTING MORE DEMANDING REQUIREMENTS AND. -- IN. WE RECOGNIZE IT WAS DIFFICULT IN A RURAL STATE LIKE ARKANSAS AND IT WILL STAY LIKE SOUTH CAROLINA TO PROVIDE ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYBODY EVERYWHERE. I HELPED TO START THE ARKANSAS SCHOOL FOR MATH AND SCIENCE. IT'S A BOARDING SCHOOL, A PUBLIC BOARDING SCHOOL. SO THAT YOUNG PEOPLE INTERESTED IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS CAN APPLY TO GO THERE IF THEY ARE IN A SMALL DISTRICT THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE COURSES THEY ARE LOOKING FOR. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US DO MORE OF THAT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THERE ARE SOME STATES THAT IT DONE THIS. SOME OF THEM DO IT FOR PERFORMING ARTS. I STARTED WITH SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BUT THERE ARE OTHER KINDS OF STUDIES. WHEN YOU HAVE AS MANY SMALL TOWNS AND RURAL AREAS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE EVERYTHING IN PERSON WHICH IS WHY WE ALSO NEED TO DO MORE THROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND ONLINE LEARNING. IF YOU ARE IN A POOR SCHOOL AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE COMPUTERS AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE TABLETS AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE SCHOOL WIRED AND YOU DON'T GET HIGH-SPEED INTERNET, IT'S PRETTY HARD AND YOUR KIDS WILL FALL BEHIND. MY HIGHEST PRIORITY IS LET'S RAISE EVERYBODY UP AND LET'S PROVIDE SOME SPECIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR KIDS WHO WANT TO GO FURTHER IN THE AREAS OF THEIR EXPERTISE OR THEY WANT TO LEARN.  LET ME THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS AND LET ME THANK NEWS ONE AND EVERYONE IT WAS PART OF THIS. ESPECIALLY TO THE UNIVERSITY FOR HOSTING US.   I GAVE THE COMMENCEMENT HERE BACK IN 2007. I AM SO HONORED TO BE BACK. AS I HAVE TOLD SOME OF THE STATE ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO ARE HERE, I WANT TO BE A GOOD PARTNER. A PRESIDENT CAN DO A LOT IN SHOULD, AND I WILL WORK AS HARD AS I KNOW HOW TO FIND COMMON GROUND. EVEN WITH PEOPLE I DON'T AGREE WITH POLITICALLY. IF WE CAN FIND COMMON GROUND OF SOMETHING IMPORTANT, WE SHOULD GO FORWARD TOGETHER. I ALSO WANT TO BE A PARTNER TO THOSE MAKING CHANGE IN STATE LEGISLATURES AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS A STATE LIKE THIS. A PRESIDENT CAN ALSO DO THINGS THAT ARE NOT IN THE FORMAL JOB DESCRIPTION. WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE JOB TRAINING FOR ADVANCED MANUFACTURING. WE WILL GIVE PEOPLE -- GET PEOPLE TOGETHER AND COME UP WITH A PLAN AND TRY TO SELL EVERYBODY ON DOING THAT. CONVENING, CATALYZING CHANGE, CONNECTING PEOPLE UP LIKE THE ARKANSAS DEVELOPMENT BANK CORPORATION. LET'S FIND OUT WHY IT SUCCEEDED AND WHITE SOUTH SHORE DID NOT AND HOW WE CAN DO MORE OF WHAT WORKS IN COMMUNITIES LIKE THOSE HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. I WANT TO BE A COORDINATOR AND CONNECTOR SO THAT WE GET PEOPLE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF DOING THE MATTER WHERE WE ARE. DON'T WAIT FOR SOMEBODY IN WASHINGTON. MAKE THE POLITICAL DEMAND LIKE WHAT YOU NEED FROM WASHINGTON. TRY TO HOLD YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE. IF WE COULD GET VOTER REGISTRATION UP IN SOUTH CAROLINA, YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS WITH THE THAN THEY DO RIGHT NOW IN MANY PARTS OF THE  WHEN YOU GOT TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP, FROM THE GRASSROOTS UP IN FROM THE TOP DOWN. WE HAVE GOT TO GIVE MORE PEOPLE THE TOOLS TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR THEIR OWN LIVES. THAT IS WHAT I GREW UP DOING. THAT IS WHAT I LEARNED TO DO AND THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO AS YOUR PRESIDENT.   I DON'T.  BUT I HAVE TO SEE IT IN ORDER TO KNOW IT. WHO CAN SHOW ME? DON'T BE SHY.  IT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. MRS. CLINTON: YOU RAISE IT NOW","Hillary Clinton Town Hall Meeting in Orangeburg, South Carolina"

I WANT TO THANK ANDY AND EVERYONE WHO IS HELPING TO TRY TO REBUILD THE IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY FROM THE GROUND UP. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK MY FRIENDS TOM AND RUTH HARKINS. TOM AND CHRISTIE. LEONARD AND DODI BOSWELL. AND YOUR CONGRESSMAN FREILICH, -- CONGRESSMAN FOR IOWA.  SEN. CLINTON: AND I HAVE TO GIVE A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO SOMEBODY REALLY SPECIAL. SOMEBODY WHOSE BIRTHDAY IS TOMORROW. SOMEONE WHO REMINDS US THAT SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO LET THEM HEAR YOU ARE. KATY PERRY, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.  SEN. CLINTON: DID ANY OF YOU SEE OUR DEBATE IN LAS VEGAS?  SEN. CLINTON: YOU KNOW, WHEN REPUBLICANS DEBATE, THEY COMPETE TO INSULT EACH OTHER, DEMEAN WOMEN, AND THEY DOUBLE DOWN ON TRICKLE-DOWN. ACTUALLY, IT IS REALITY TV. WITH A CAST OF CHARACTERS WHO DO NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT ACTUAL REALITY. BUT, THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE. WHEN WE, DEMOCRATS DEBATE, YOU SEE SOMETHING. YOU SEE US TACKLING THE HARD ISSUES. LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS TO OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES, FACING OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COUNTRY. HOW ARE WE GOING TO RAISE WAGES AND CREATE MORE GOOD JOBS? HOW WILL WE RESPOND TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND LIFT UP OUR ECONOMY BY INVESTING IN CLEAN ENERGY? HOW WILL WE MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AND GET PARENTS TO PAY BELIEVE THAT THEY NEED? HOW WILL WE, WORKING WITH OUR TEACHERS AND OUR FAMILIES, HELP OUR KIDS GET READY TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL?  SEN. CLINTON: AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO RAIN AND WALL STREET AND LIFT UP MAIN STREET? AND, HOW MUCH LONGER CAN WE WAIT TO STAND UP TO THE GUN LOBBY AND KEEP OUR KIDS AND OUR COMMUNITIES SAFE AND AMERICA?  SEN. CLINTON: YOU SEE. WE DEMOCRATS ARE OFFERING REAL SOLUTIONS. LIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DONE FOR THE PAST 6.5 YEARS. AND BY HIS SIDE, EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, HAS BEEN VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.  SEN. CLINTON: HE HAS FOUGHT PASSIONATELY FOR MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES AND MIDDLE-CLASS VALUES. LET'S SHOW HIM HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN AND ALL HE HAS DONE FOR OUR COUNTRY. LET'S GIVE IT UP FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT.  SEN. CLINTON: YOU KNOW, I THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN THIS ELECTION TO REMEMBER WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA INHERITED. THE REPUBLICANS WOULD LIKE US ALL TO FORGET. BUT HE INHERITED THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. WE WERE LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH. RIGHT AFTER THAT ELECTION, HE CALLED ME AND ASKED ME TO COME SEE HIM IN CHICAGO. I DID NOT KNOW WHY, IT TURNED OUT HE WANT ME TO BE SECRETARY OF EIGHT, BUT WHEN WE GOT THERE --   SEN. CLINTON: IT WAS JUST THE TWO OF US. AND WE WERE JUST TALKING AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE WAS FACING. HE SAID, IT IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN THEY TOLD US. WE WERE LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH. 9 MILLION AMERICANS ENDED UP LOSING THEIR JOBS. AND 5 MILLION LOST THEIR HOMES. AND LISTEN TO THIS. $13 TRILLION OF FAMILY WEALTH WAS WIPED AWAY. I DON'T THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA GETS THE CREDIT THAT HE DESERVES FOR RESCUING OUR ECONOMY FROM FALLING INTO A GREAT DEPRESSION.  SEN. CLINTON: HE SAVED THE AUTO INDUSTRY. HE IMPOSED TOUGH, NEW RULES ON WALL STREET. AND HE EXTENDED HEALTH CARE TO 18 MILLION AMERICANS.  SEN. CLINTON: THAT IS WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT WHEN YOU VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS.  SEN. CLINTON: WHEN THERE IS A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AMERICA CREATES MORE JOBS. THE ECONOMY GROWS FASTER. AND DEFICITS ARE SMALLER. EVEN THOUGH THEY HATE IT WHEN I SAY THIS, RECESSIONS HAPPEN FOUR TIMES MORE FREQUENTLY UNDER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS.  SEN. CLINTON: SO, WE CANNOT AFFORD TO GO BACK TO THE REPUBLICAN FAILED POLICIES. I AM NOT RUNNING FOR MY HUSBAND'S THIRD TERM, AND I'M NOT RUNNING FOR BARACK OBAMA'S THIRD TERM, I AM RUNNING FOR MY FIRST TERM --   SEN. CLINTON: AND, I AM RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT.  SEN. CLINTON: WE NEED TO DEFEND THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA. AND WE NEED TO BUILD ON IT, UNTIL THE RECOVERY IS SECURE, AND ALL AMERICANS HAVE A CHANCE TO RAISE THEIR INCOME. AND TO BELIEVE, ONCE AGAIN, IN THE BASIC BARGAIN OF AMERICA. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS. IF YOU WORK HARD, AND YOU DO YOUR PART, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD.  SEN. CLINTON: BUT, FOR FAR TOO LONG, REPUBLICANS AND THEIR ALLIES HAVE STACKED THE DECK FOR THOSE AT THE TOP. THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN THE TOP 25 HEDGE FUND MANAGERS EARN MORE IN A YEAR THAN ALL THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS IN AMERICA COMBINED.  SEN. CLINTON: OR, WHEN TOP CEOS MAKE 300 TIMES WHAT A TYPICAL WORKER DOES, OR WHEN CORPORATE PROFITS SOAR, BUT EMPLOYEES DO NOT SHARE IN THOSE PROFITS. WHEN IT IS EASY FOR A BIG CORPORATION TO GET A TAX BREAK, BUT IT IS STILL TOO HARD FOR A SMALL BUSINESS TO GET A LOAN. WHEN THE CEO OF A DRUG COMPANY JACK'S UP THE PRICE OF LIFE-SAVING MEDICINE BY 5000% OVERNIGHT --   SEN. CLINTON: AND, WHEN THE GOVERNOR OF THIS STATE VETOES A BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE TO FUND SCHOOLS AND TO KEEP MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES OPEN.  SEN. CLINTON: AND NOW, NOW YOU'RE GOVERNOR IS THREATENING TO PRIVATIZE MEDICAID.  SEN. CLINTON: AND THE HAWK EYED CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM, SOMETHING THAT I HELPED TO START IN THE 1990'S.  SEN. CLINTON: AND THOUSANDS OF ISLANDS ARE -- AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM IOWA ARE STANDING UP AND SAYING ENOUGH, AND I AM STANDING WITH YOU.  SEN. CLINTON: I HAVE TO TELL YOU.  SEN. CLINTON: YOU KNOW THAT THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES CANNOT HELP THEMSELVES.  SEN. CLINTON: THEY ARE PUSHING THE SAME FAILED POLICIES THAT CRASHED OUR ECONOMY BEFORE. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. CUTTING TAXES ON THE SUPER WEALTHY. LETTING BIG CORPORATIONS WRITE THEIR OWN ROLES. BUSTING UNIONS. IGNORING THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE HAVE HEARD ALL OF THIS BEFORE, AND WE KNOW WHAT IT DOES. AND, OF COURSE, NONE OF THEM IS SERIOUS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. I LOVE IT. WHEN THEY ARE ASKED ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW IT THERE ANSWER IS? I AM NOT A SCIENTIST. WELL, WHY DON'T THEY START LISTENING TO THOSE WHO ARE SCIENTISTS, AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST AROUND THE WORLD?  SEN. CLINTON: AND REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS HAVE NOW VOTED MORE THAN 50 TIMES TO REPEAL OR WEAKEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THEY WANT TO FORCE AMERICANS --   SEN. CLINTON: THAT IS WORTHY OF A BIG LUNCH OF BOOS. BECAUSE THEY WANT TO FORCE AMERICANS TO START A CONTENTIOUS HEALTH CARE DEBATE ALL OVER AGAIN. I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN IMPROVE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THEM TAKE US BACK TO INSURANCE COMPANIES WRITING THEIR OWN RULES AGAIN.  SEN. CLINTON: YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WAS LIKE. THEY EVEN CHARGED WOMEN MORE FOR OUR COVERAGE, THEN MEN.  SEN. CLINTON: AND WE SURE CAN'T LET THEM TAKE US BACK TO THE WILD WEST ON WALL STREET. REPEAL. FRANK. DESTROY THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BOARD. WE ARE GOING TO STAND FIRM. THAT IS WHY I PROPOSE TOUGH ACTION TO END THE ABUSES BY THE BIG BANKS, AND THE EXCESSIVE RISK IN THE SO-CALLED SHADOW BANKING SYSTEM. WE ARE GOING TO STOP WALL STREET HURTING MAINSTREET.  SEN. CLINTON: AND HERE WE ARE, EVERYONE HERE IS HERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE FOR, AND THAT IS PRETTY CLEAR STANDING UP HERE, AND SEEING WHO IS SITTING WHERE, BUT WE ALL AGREE ON THIS -- WE CANNOT LET REPUBLICANS KEEP RAKING OUR ELECTIONS WITH -- RIGGING OUR ELECTIONS WITH SECRET UNACCOUNTABLE, DARK MONEY.  SEN. CLINTON: WE NEED A SUPREME COURT THAT THE TAX THE RIGHT OF EVERY CITIZEN TO VOTE, NOT THE RIGHT OF EVERY CORPORATION TO BUY ELECTIONS.  SEN. CLINTON: AND I SAID FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF MY CAMPAIGN, EVEN IF IT TAKES A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, WE WILL OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED ONCE AND FOR ALL.  SEN. CLINTON: AND I SOMETIMES WONDER WHETHER YOU SIGN UP TO BE A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT -- THEY PUT YOU INTO SOME KIND OF TIME A SHEEN. AND THEY TAKE YOU BACK 50 OR 70 OR 100 YEARS, BECAUSE THEY KEEP SAYING THE SAME OUT OF DATE, OUT OF TOUCH THINGS. WE WILL NEVER LET THE REPUBLICANS CUT OR PRIVATIZE SOCIAL SECURITY OR AND MEDICARE AS SOMEHOW NOW PROMISING -- SOME ARE NOW PROMISING.  SEN. CLINTON: I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE. I AM GOING TO BACK AND SUPPORT WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DONE TO PROTECT DREAMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES, TO USE EXECUTIVE ACTION TO PREVENT DEPORTATION. AND I HAVE SAID THAT IF WE CANNOT GET COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM AS WE NEED AND AS WE SHOULD, WITH A REAL PATH TO CITIZENSHIP THAT WILL ACTUALLY GROW OUR ECONOMY -- THEN I WILL GO AS FAR AS I CAN, EVEN BEYOND PRESIDENT OBAMA, TO MAKE SURE LAW-ABIDING, DECENT, HARD-WORKING PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE NOT RIPPED AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES.  SEN. CLINTON: AND DON'T YOU WONDER, DON'T YOU WONDER? YOU KNOW, FOR PEOPLE WHO CLAIM THEY HATE THE GOVERNMENT, REPUBLICANS LOVE USING GOVERNMENT TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR WOMEN ABOUT OUR BODIES AND OUR RIGHTS.  SEN. CLINTON: WELL, I WILL TELL YOU, I WILL TELL YOU, I WILL DO EVERYTHING THAT I CAN TO PROTECT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND TO DEFEND PLANNED PARENTHOOD.  SEN. CLINTON: NOW --  SEN. CLINTON: NOW I KNOW --  SEN. CLINTON: I KNOW WHEN I TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS, REPUBLICANS SAY THAT I AM PLAYING THE GENDER CARD. I KNOW. WELL, IF TALKING ABOUT EQUAL PAY, PAID FAMILY LEAVE, AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE, AND WOMEN'S HEALTH IS PLAYING THE GENDER CARD, DEAL ME IN.   SEN. CLINTON: I KNOW, I KNOW AND YOU KNOW, IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO RAIL AGAINST THE REPUBLICANS AND THE BILLIONAIRES. WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO WIN THIS ELECTION IN ORDER TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS AND MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. WE HAVE TO BUILD IN AMERICA AGAIN WHERE SUCCESS IS MEASURED BY HOW MANY PEOPLE WORK THEIR WAY INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS, NOT HOW MANY CEOS GET BONUSES. BY HOW MANY CHILDREN CLIMB OUT OF POVERTY, HOW MANY FAMILIES CAN AFFORD HEALTH CARE, MANY YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GO TO COLLEGE WITHOUT TAKING ON YEARS OF DEBT.  SEN. CLINTON: THAT IS HOW WE SHOULD MEASURE SUCCESS IN THIS COUNTRY. AS I SAID AT THE DEBATE IN LAS VEGAS, I AM A PROGRESSIVE WHO LIKES TO GET THINGS DONE.  SEN. CLINTON: AND I STILL BELIEVE, AS A SMART MAN ONCE SAID, THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH AMERICA THAT CANNOT BE FIXED BY WHAT IS RIGHT WITH AMERICA. SO I HEAR DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE SAYS WE HAVE TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. HERE IS WHAT I SAID. AMERICA IS GREAT. WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE IT FAIR AND JUST. WE HAVE TO MAKE AMERICA WORK FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP.  SEN. CLINTON: BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WHEN AMERICANS COME TOGETHER, COME UP WITH SMART SOLUTIONS, AND FIGHT TO GET RESULTS, THERE IS NO CHALLENGE WE CANNOT MEET. AND AT THE TOP OF MY LIST OF FIGHTS WE HAVE TO WAGE AND WIN, IT IS THIS. AMERICANS NEED A RAISE. THAT IS WHY WE MUST RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE FOR IT. NOBODY WHO WORKS FULL-TIME SHOULD LIVE IN POVERTY. AND I WANT COMPANIES TO HAVE INCENTIVES TO SHARE MORE PROFITS WITH EMPLOYEES WHO HELP TO MAKE THE PROFITS IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND COMPANIES THAT SHIP JOBS AND PROFITS OVERSEAS SHOULD NOT GET TAX BREAKS. YOU SHOULD GET TAX BREAKS AGAIN.  SEN. CLINTON: I SAID I WANT TO BE THE SMALL BUSINESS PRESIDENT AND I MEAN IT. BECAUSE SMALL BUSINESSES WILL CREATE MOST OF THE GOOD NEW JOBS OF THE FUTURE AND SHOULD HAVE LESS RED TAPE, EASIER ACCESS TO CREDIT, AND TAX RELIEF. TO CREATE THOSE JOBS, WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO INVESTING IN SCIENCE AND MEDICAL RESEARCH. WE SHOULD ESTABLISH AN INFRASTRUCTURE BANK TO PUT AMERICANS TO WORK BUILDING OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES AND AIRPORTS AND RAILS AND BROADBAND NETWORKS.  SEN. CLINTON: AND I BELIEVE WE CAN MAKE AMERICA THE WORLD'S CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER BY SETTING AND REACHING GOALS AGAIN.  SEN. CLINTON: HOW ABOUT THIS? HALF A BILLION SOLAR PANELS IN FOUR YEARS AND ENOUGH RENEWABLE ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME IN AMERICA IN 10 YEARS.  SEN. CLINTON: I KNOW THAT WE CAN DO THIS BECAUSE IOWA IS LEADING THE WAY. YOU ARE PRODUCING HALF OF YOUR POWER FROM WIND AND RENEWABLES. I WANT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY TO FOLLOW YOUR LEAD.  SEN. CLINTON: AND IF WE WANT OUR ECONOMY TO GROW LIKE IT SHOULD, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WOMEN WHO STILL EARN LESS THAN MEN ON THE JOB AND WOMEN OF COLOR WHO EARN THE LEAST OF ALL FINALLY GET EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK.  SEN. CLINTON: BECAUSE WHEN YOU SHORTCHANGE WOMEN, YOU SHORTCHANGE FAMILIES AND YOU SHORTCHANGE AMERICA. AND MY NEW COLLEGE COMPACT WILL HELP STUDENTS AND GRADUATES REFINANCE DEBTS, JUST LIKE YOU CAN WITH A MORTGAGE OR A CAR LOAN. AND NOBODY WILL HAVE TO BORROW A SENT TO ATTEND A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY.  SEN. CLINTON: BUT LET ME SAY THIS. WHILE WE FIGHT FOR A GROWTH UNFAIRNESS ECONOMY THAT FIGHTS FOR EVERYONE, WE CANNOT FORGET THE QUIETER PROBLEMS THAT OFTEN DO NOT MAKE THE HEADLINES. I AM ALSO FIGHTING FOR THE GRANDMOTHER WHO TOLD ME SHE IS RAISING HER GRANDCHILD BECAUSE OF HER DAUGHTER'S STRUGGLE WITH DRUG ADDICTION, FOR THE MOM WHO ASKED ME WHAT SHE IS GOING TO DO WHEN HER CHILD WITH AUTISM GETS OLDER, FOR EVERY FAMILY TRYING TO COPE WITH UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS. I AM FIGHTING FOR THE MAN I MET WHOSE MOTHER HAS ALZHEIMER'S. HE CANNOT AFFORD A FULL-TIME CAREGIVER, SO DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE DOES? HE IS A TEACHER. HE TAKES HIS MOTHER TO WORK WITH HIM. FOR LGBT AMERICANS WHO DESPITE ALL OF OUR PROGRESS, AND GET MARRIED ON SATURDAY AND FIRED ON MONDAY IN A LOT OF STATES JUST BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE AND WHO THEY LOVE. FOR OUR VETERANS OF ALL AGES WHO SERVED OUR COUNTRY WITH HONOR AND COURAGE AND DESERVE THE BENEFITS THAT THEY HAVE EARNED WITHOUT DELAYS AND ABUSES.  SEN. CLINTON: I AM FIGHTING TO REFORM CRIMINAL JUSTICE FOR EVERY MOTHER AND FATHER WHO WORRY EVERY DAY THAT THEIR CHILD WILL BE STOPPED BY THE POLICE JUST FOR BEING AFRICAN-AMERICAN, BECAUSE YES, BLACK LIVES MATTER.  SEN. CLINTON: AND I AM FIGHTING TO PROTECT OUR KIDS IN COMMUNITIES FROM THE PLAGUE OF GUN VIOLENCE. YOU SHOULD BE SAFE WHEN YOU GO TO SCHOOL, WHEN YOU GO TO THE MOVIES, WHEN YOU GO TO CHURCH. THAT IS WHY I AM PROPOSING COMMON SENSE GUN SAFETY MEASURES LIKE UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS, CLOSING LOOPHOLES, AND REPAIRING THE LAW THAT SHIELDS GUNMAKERS AND SELLERS FROM ACCOUNTABILITY.  SEN. CLINTON: NOW, I HAVE BEEN TOLD TO STOP SHOUTING ABOUT ENDING GUN VIOLENCE. WELL, I HAVE NOT BEEN SHOUTING BUT SOMETIMES WHEN A WOMAN SPEAKS OUT SOME PEOPLE THINK IT IS SHOUTING.  SEN. CLINTON: BUT --  SEN. CLINTON: I WILL NOT BE SILENCED AND I HOPE YOU WILL NOT BE EITHER. HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE BEFORE WE TAKE ACTION? FOLKS, I HAVE BEEN AT THIS EFFORT TO CHANGE AND REFORM OUR COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME, AND I HAVE NOT WON EVERY BATTLE. BUT I HAVE LEARNED FROM EACH ONE. I KNOW HOW TO STAND MY GROUND AND HOW TO FIND COMMON GROUND.  SEN. CLINTON: THAT IS HOW I WORKED WITH A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO HELP CREATE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE AROUND WHICH COVERS A MILLION KIDS. THAT IS WHY AS A SENATOR I WORKED WITH THE REPUBLICANS TO EXPAND HEALTH BENEFITS FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE AND FOR THE FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE FIGHTERS WHO RUSHED TOWARDS DANGER ON 9/11 AND LATER GREW SICK AFTER THEIR TIME AT GROUND ZERO. AND AS YOUR SECRETARY OF STATE, I FOUGHT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHTS, LGBT RIGHTS, INTERNET FREEDOM, AMERICAN JOBS, AND SECURITY. BUT I ALSO FIND COMMON GROUND, PERSUADING RUSSIA TO JOIN IN THE STRICTEST SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN IN HISTORY. I HAVE SPENT MY LIFE WORKING FOR CHILDREN, WOMEN, FAMILIES, AND THE COUNTRY, FROM THE KITCHEN TABLE TO THE PEACE TABLE, TRYING TO EVEN THE ODDS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE ODDS STACKED AGAINST THEM AND I AM JUST GETTING WARMED UP.  SEN. CLINTON: SO I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I AM LISTENING TO YOU. I AM FIGHTING FOR YOU. AND WITH YOUR SUPPORT, IOWA, I AM GOING TO DELIVER. AND I DID NOT LEARN ABOUT FAIRNESS, JUSTICE, AND THE AMERICAN DREAM FROM POLITICS. I LEARNED ABOUT IT FROM MY OWN FAMILY. MY FATHER WHO RAN A SMALL BUSINESS PRINTING DRAPERY FABRICS TAUGHT ME THAT ANYTHING WORTH IT IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR. AND MY MOTHER, WORKING AS A MAID AT THE AGE OF 14, TOLD ME THAT AT CRUCIAL MOMENTS, PEOPLE SHOWED HER KINDNESS, WITH THAT FIRST GRADE TEACHER WHO MADE SURE SHE HAD ENOUGH TO EAT WHEN HER PARENTS DID NOT EVEN CARE ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE OF THAT. IT IS ONE OF THE MANY REASONS I AM GRATEFUL FOR EDUCATORS. INSTEAD OF BECOMING BITTER OR BROKEN, SHE BECAME RESILIENT. GET BACK UP, FACE YOUR CHALLENGES, SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS. DO NOT JUST COMPLAIN ABOUT THEM.  SEN. CLINTON: SO, LET ME TELL YOU, I AM THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FACTORY WORKER AND THE GRANDMOTHER OF THE MOST WONDERFUL LITTLE GIRL IN THE WORLD. AND BILL AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT SHE HAS EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED IN LIFE. BUT I DO NOT THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE TO BE THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FORMER PRESIDENT TO SHARE IN THE PROMISE OF AMERICA. THE GRANDDAUGHTERS AND GRANDSONS OF FACTORY WORKERS AND TRUCK DRIVERS AND NURSES AND FARMERS SHOULD HAVE THE SAME CHANCE, TOO.  SEN. CLINTON: EVERYONE OF AMERICA'S CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE UP TO THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. THAT IS WHAT I AM FIGHTING FOR, STRUGGLING AND STRIVING. I AM FIGHTING FOR EVERYONE WHO IS EVER BEEN KNOCKED DOWN BUT REFUSED TO BE KNOCKED OUT. AND TOGETHER, WE'RE GOING TO BUILD AN AMERICA WHERE THERE ARE NO CEILINGS FOR ANYONE. WHERE NO ONE GETS LEFT BEHIND OR LEFT OUT. AND YES, WHERE A FATHER CAN TELL HIS DAUGHTER YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO BE, INCLUDING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.   >> THANK YOU, SECRETARY CLINTON. YOU KNOW, WHAT A NIGHT. AND WHAT AN AMAZING GROUP OF DEMOCRATS WE HAVE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. ARE YOU FIRED UP, IOWA?  >> IOWA DEMOCRATS, LET'S WELCOME BACK ALL OF OUR AMAZING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO THE STAGE, AND THEIR FAMILIES.   >>  I'VE BEEN KNOCKING ON THE DOOR THAT HOLDS THE THRONE I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE MAP THAT LEADS ME HOME I'VE BEEN STUMBLING ON GOOD HEARTS TURNED TO STONE THE ROAD OF GOOD INTENTIONS HAS GONE DRY AS BONE WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN  WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN  WHEREVER THE FLAG IS FLOWN  WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN FROM CHICAGO TO NEW ORLEANS FROM THE MUSCLE TO THE BONE",Presidential Candidates at the Iowa Jefferson-Jackson Dinner

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HILLARY CLINTON.    >> GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S BEEN QUITE A WEEK HASN'T IT LACKS THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. I'M ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED TO BE HERE AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW I HAD A PRETTY LONG DAY YESTERDAY.  BUT I FINALLY GOT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS, SOMETHING I'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR LITERALLY A YEAR, AND I'M JUST GRATEFUL I'VE RECOVERED MY VOICE WHICH I LOST A LITTLE BIT BUT AS I SAID AT THE START, I WANTED TO RISE ABOVE PARTISANSHIP AND REACH FOR STATESMANSHIP AND THAT IS WHAT I TRIED TO DO.  NOW I'M DELIGHTED TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU TO BE HERE WITH A GROUP THAT ACTUALLY FOCUSES ON THE ISSUES. YOU ARE WOMEN AFTER MY OWN HEART. I WANT TO THANK YOU AND ALL OF THE TURKIC SPEAKERS YOU'VE HEARD FROM IT WILL HEAR FROM INCLUDING MY FRIEND AND LEADER NANCY PELOSI.  AND I WANT TO SAY ANOTHER WORD ABOUT A GREAT DEMOCRAT WHO'S ALWAYS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR WOMEN AND FAMILIES. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.  HE FOUGHT FOR THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND SO MUCH MORE, AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT HISTORY ISN'T FINISHED WITH JOE BIDEN. AS HE SAID THE OTHER DAY, THERE IS MORE WORK TO DO. AND IF I KNOW JOSIE WILL DON'T SHOW HE WILL BE RIGHT THERE WITH US ON THE FRONT LINE. AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR PUTTING WOMEN'S VOICES, WOMEN'S IDEAS, WOMEN'S LIVES RIGHT WHERE THEY BELONG, AT THE HEART OF AMERICAN POLITICS. IT IS SOMETIMES HARD TO BELIEVE, BUT THE NOTION THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE EQUAL PARTNERS IN THE LIFE OF OUR NATION IS STILL PRETTY NEW. THAT'S WHY THE LEADERSHIP FORUM WAS CREATED TO HELP MAKE THAT IDEAL A REALITY. DURING A 1992 CAMPAIGN, WE TRAVELED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AND WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN PEOPLE'S LIVING ROOMS AND IN THEIR BACKYARDS SITTING AROUND KITCHEN TABLES TALKING WITH MOTHERS, DAUGHTERS AND GRANDMOTHERS ABOUT THEIR LIVES, AND WE HEARD SO MUCH. WE HEARD ABOUT THE DREAMS FOR THE FUTURE THAT PEOPLE HAD THEMSELVES AND THEIR KIDS, AND WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE STRUGGLES THAT MADE LIFE HARDER THAN IT SHOULD BE. THE PROBLEMS THAT KEPT WOMEN UP AT NIGHT. AGAIN AND AGAIN WE WOULD HEAR YOU KNOW, NO ONE HAS EVER ASKED US THESE THINGS BEFORE. TO A LOT OF THEM IT SEEMED LIKE WATCHING TIM JUST WASN'T VERY INTERESTED IN THE ACTUAL REAL LIVES OF WOMEN IN THE COUNTRY. SO, WE DECIDED WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THIS PARTY, OUR PARTY, WOMEN'S VOICES WOULD ALWAYS BE HEARD. BUT IN THIS PARTY, OUR PARTY THE PROBLEMS THAT KEEP WOMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES UP AT NIGHT WOULD ALWAYS BE FRONT AND CENTER AND WE WANTED TO BRING MORE WOMEN INTO THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AS THE VOTERS CAN ADVOCATE THE ORGANIZERS, FUNDRAISERS, CANDIDATES AND ELECTED OFFICIALS BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN HALF THE COUNTRY COME INDEED SLIGHTLY MORE, HALF THE PLANET AND MORE THAN HALF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WOMEN AND FAMILIES ARE BETTER REPRESENTED IN POLITICS. WE NEED TO GET MORE OF US INVOLVED IN POLITICS AT EVERY LEVEL. WHEN WOMEN LEAD, FAMILIES SUCCEED AND NOW 22 YEARS LATER --  WOMEN ARE A GREATER FORCE IN POLITICS HERE IN THE COUNTRY THAN EVER BEFORE. WE ARE VOTING IN GREATER NUMBERS, INCREASINGLY WE ARE THE DECISIVE VOTERS IN NATIONAL ELECTIONS. MORE WOMEN ARE SERVING AT HIGHER LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE NOT WANTED, NOT TWO BUT THREE WOMEN ON THE SUPREME COURT.  AND THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED IN THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE HAVE GROWN EXPONENTIALLY. AND NOW OF COURSE ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SEASON HAS BEGUN AND I'M GIVING EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ISSUES THAT MATTER MOST TO WOMEN AND FAMILIES ARE FRONT AND CENTER IN THIS RACE. I STARTED MY CAMPAIGN LAST SPRING DOING THE SAME THING THAT I DID ALL THOSE YEARS AGO WHEN I RAN FOR THE SENATE, TRAVELING ACROSS THE COUNTRY, VISITING PEOPLE AT HOME AND SCHOOL AND BUSINESSES AND ACTUALLY LISTENING AS THEY TOLD ME ABOUT THEIR LIVES, THE GOOD AND THE BAD, THE HARD. IT WAS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE. HE FINDS THE TIME AND SPACE TO GIVE PEOPLE THE CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU INSTEAD OF TALKING AT THEM. THEY WILL SHARE WHAT'S IN THEIR HEARTS. MANY FAMILIES DO FEEL THINGS ARE A LOT BETTER FOR THEM AND THEY GET CREDIT AS THEY SHOULD TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HIS ADMINISTRATION.  THE PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP AND THE HARD WORK OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HOLD OUR ECONOMY AND NATION BACK FROM THE BRINK. IN FACT, WE COULD HAVE HAD A GREAT DEEP RUSSIAN, NOT A GREAT RECESSION. SO AS I TRAVEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY I TRY TO TELL THE STORY OF WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA INHERITED, THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. SO AMERICA IS STANDING AGAIN BUT WE ARE NOT YET RUNNING THE WAY WE SHOULD BE. AND FAMILIES ARE STILL STRETCHED IN A MILLION DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND SO ARE THEIR BUDGETS. COSTS KEEP RISING BUT MOST PEOPLE'S PAYCHECKS HAVEN'T MOVED IN YEARS. THE CORPORATE PROFIT AND CEO PAY KEEP RISING. QUALITY CHILDCARE COSTS MORE THAN COLLEGE TUITION IN MANY STATES AND THE MINIMUM WAGE IS A POVERTY WAGE. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE HELD BACK BY STUDENT DEBT AND AT A TIME WHEN MORE WOMEN THAN EVER ARE THE FAMILY'S MAIN BREADWINNERS. TOO OFTEN, THEY STILL DON'T GET EQUAL PAY. AND WOMEN OF COLOR EARN LESS THAN OTHERS.  AND JUST THIS WEEK THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR RELEASED NEW DATA SHOWING THAT AS OUR ECONOMY GETS STRONGER, MEN'S PAY IS GOING UP MORE THAN TWICE AS FAST AS WOMEN'S PAY. ONE OF MY TOWN HALLS IN NEVADA WE CALLED HIM A LITTLE ON A LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS SITTING WITH HER FOR HER AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT KIDS ARE GOING TO ASK YOU WHICH IS WHY I TRY TO CALL ON AT LEAST ONE IF THEY ARE IN MY TOWN HALL. SHE SAID IF YOU ARE A GIRL PRESIDENT WILL YOU BE PAID AS MUCH AS A BOY PRESIDENT?  I SAID I THINK SO. I THINK THAT'S IN THE LAW.  BUT I THINK AS A SINGLE MOM AND I MET THAT WAS JUGGLING A JOB AND CLASSES INTO COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHILE RAISING HER THREE KIDS ON HER OWN, SHE'S DOING WHAT SHE HAS TO TO GET HER CHILDREN A BETTER LIFE AND SHE DOESN'T EXPECT ANYTHING TO COME EASY -- HE ASKED ME IF THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE QUITE SO HARD? I THINK AS A STUDENT WHO TOLD ME THAT PAYING FOR COLLEGE SHOULD BE THE HARDEST THING ABOUT GOING TO COLLEGE OR DEMAND I MET WHOSE MOTHER HAD ALZHEIMER'S. HE'S A TEACHER IN CANADA FOR A FULL-TIME CARETAKER, HE CAN'T QUIT HIS JOB OR HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT HER. YOU KNOW WHAT HE DOES, HE BRINGS HER TO WORK WITH HIM. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE HE CAN THINK OF AND HE TOLD ME THIS WAS SO MUCH SAT US BECAUSE THIS ISN'T WHAT HE PICTURED FOR HIS MOTHER'S GOLDEN YEARS AND IT'S NOT JUST WOMEN TAKING CARE OF AGING PARENTS, IT IS LIKE THIS YOUNG MAN ALL OF OUR CARETAKERS DESERVE A LOT MORE SUPPORT. AND THE SAME GOES FOR OTHER POLICIES LIKE PAID FAMILY LEAVE, FAIR AND PREDICTABLE SHIFTS, HIGHER WAGES FOR YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORK TWO JOBS TO MAKE ENDS MEET, AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY BE HOME WITH YOUR KIDS AT NIGHT. AND THESE ARE NOT JUST CHALLENGES FOR WOMEN THEY ARE CHALLENGES FOR ALL AMERICANS BECAUSE I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE FIGHT FOR WOMEN WE ARE FIGHTING FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND THE REVERSE IS TRUE AS WELL. WHEN WE FIGHT TO MAKE AMERICA STRONGER AND MORE PROSPEROUS, WE ARE ALSO FIGHTING FOR WOMEN. WHEN WE FIGHT TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE THAN STUPID DEATHLESS PUNISHING WORK TO HOLD CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY TELL JUST ONE TRY TO PRICES OR FALLUJA OR ENVIRONMENT OR EXPLOIT WORKERS, THAT'S FIGHTING FOR WOMEN AND MEN IN AMERICA AND WHEN WE FIGHT TO CREATE A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR MILLIONS OF IMMIGRANTS, WE WILL MAKE SOCIAL SECURITY EVEN STRONGER OR TO PROTECT AND IMPROVE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BECAUSE EVERYONE DESERVES ACCESS TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE CARE.  AND THAT ACCESS SHOULD INCLUDE BASICS LIKE REPRODUCTIVE CARE AND BIRTH CONTROL AND PRENATAL CARE AND. CANCER SCREENINGS. THAT'S WHY WE HAD THIS PLANNED FOR PARENTHOOD AGAINST THE ATTACKS THAT ARE BEING WAGED.  WHEN WE FIGHT TO PROTECT EQUAL RIGHTS OF ALL OUR PEOPLE NO MATTER WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE OR WHO THEY LOVE, AND WHEN WE FIGHT TO STOP THE EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE THAT IS CLAIMING INNOCENT LIVES EVERY SINGLE DAY IN EVERY CORNER OF OUR COUNTRY, THAT IS FIGHTING FOR WOMEN AND MEN IN AMERICA. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN TOLD TO STOP SHOUTING ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE. FIRST OF ALL, I AM NOT SHOUTING. IT'S JUST WHEN WOMEN TALK SOME PEOPLE THINK WE ARE SHOUTING.  AND SECOND, I WILL NOT BE SILENT BECAUSE WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED COMING OFF BY THE GUN LOBBY, NOT BY THE SIZE OF THE CHALLENGE COME HIM AND NOT TO NOT BUY ANY OF IT. STOPPING GUN VIOLENCE IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR. I'M READY TO GO AND I HOPE THAT YOU ARE WITH ME.  NONE OF THESE FIGHTS ARE NEW TO ME AND I KNOW THEY ARE NOT NEW TO MANY OF YOU BUT WE DO HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WITH A VERY DIFFERENT VISION FOR THE COUNTRY. AND THEY WILL SAY, DO AND SPEND WHATEVER IT TAKES TO EXPAND THE OUT OF TOUCH OUT OF DATE CHECKOUT. FOR THOSE THAT SAY THEY HATE BIG GOVERNMENT, REPUBLICANS SURE SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO RESTRICT WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE TALK AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS.  >> AFTER MY EXPERIENCE YESTERDAY, I AM JUST AMAZED THAT THEY ARE EVEN TALKING ABOUT SETTING UP ANOTHER SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE. THIS TIME TO INVESTIGATE PLANNED PARENTHOOD. AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW BY NOW THAT IS JUST CODE FOR A PARTISAN WITCHHUNT. HAVEN'T WE SEEN ENOUGH OF THAT? .-FULL-STOP I WOULD LIKE THOSE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WHO ARE ADVOCATING AGAINST PLANNED PARENTHOOD TO MEET MEET THE MOM THAT CAUGHT HER CANCER EARLIER THANKS TO A SCREENING OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD OR A YOUNG WOMAN THAT AVOIDED AN UNINTENDED PREGNANCY BECAUSE SHE DID HAVE ACCESS. I KNOW I TALK LIKE THIS REPUBLICANS WILL SAY I'M PLAYING THE GENDER CARD CREATE YOU KNOW WHAT HERE'S WHAT I SAY. CALLING FOR EQUAL PAY AND PAID LEAVE AND WOMEN'S HEALTH IS PLAYING THE GENDER CARD, THEN DEAL ME IN.   THERE IS A LONG CAMPAIGN STILL AHEAD OF US, AND OTHER CANDIDATES FROM THE OTHER PARTY MAY BE OUT THERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH AMERICA, TRYING TO BLAME PEOPLE FOR IT. WOW THAT'S NOT ME. I'M GOING TO KEEP DOING WHAT I'VE ALWAYS DONE AND THAT'S FIGHT FOR YOU AND FIGHT FOR YOUR FAMILIES. AND I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF GRASSROOTS ACTIVISTS WHO ARE JOINING ME IN THIS CAMPAIGN, NOT ONLY THOSE THAT ARE FORTUNATE TO BE IN ROOMS LIKE THIS ONE BUT THE WORKERS AND STUDENTS AND TEACHERS AND PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO ARE GIVING 1 DOLLAR OR $5 AT A TIME BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR. SO, WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY PAST 22 YEARS. I'M PROUD OF THIS ORGANIZATION AND ALL THAT IT HAS ACHIEVED. THE WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP FORUM HAS CHANGED THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.  YOU'VE CHANGED IT FOR THE BETTER. WE ARE STRONGER THAN WE'VE EVER BEEN. SO, LET'S KEEP FIGHTING FOR THAT BETTER FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN. SOME OF YOU I'M SURE NO I HAVE THE MOST AMAZING EXTRAORDINARY GRANDDAUGHTER. SHE REALLY DOES KEEP ME GOING. AND THANKFULLY MY DAUGHTER AND WONDERFUL SON-IN-LAW SENT ME VIDEOS AND LITTLE PICTURES WHICH HAVE BEEN A GREAT BOOST ALONG THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, AND I THINK A LOT ABOUT HER FUTURE. I THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF OPPORTUNITIES SHE WILL HAVE. BUT I ALSO THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF OPPORTUNITIES ALL THE CHILDREN OF AMERICA WILL HAVE YOU YET WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WILL SHE BECOME AN ADULT IN AND WHAT KIND OF WORLD WILL BE WAITING FOR HER BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S ENOUGH FOR ANYBODY THAT MY GRANDDAUGHTER, YOUR CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN, CERTAINLY THE GRANDDAUGHTER BY THE FORMER PRESIDENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO PURSUE HER DREAM WHEN SO MANY OF OUR OTHER CHILDREN ARE FEELING LESS BEHIND. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY SO FAR AS I KNOW MORE THAN HALF OF THE KIDS IN THE COUNTRY SCHOOLS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FREE OR REDUCED PRICE LUNCHES. POVERTY HAS RETURNED WITH A VENGEANCE. WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS AGAINST POVERTY LIFTING FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY ACT IN THE '90s. I THINK IT IS A VERIFIABLE FACT THAT OUR ECONOMY DOES BETTER WHEN WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE.  BOTH MY HUSBAND AND A PRESIDENT OBAMA INHERITED ECONOMIC CHALLENGES FROM THEIR REPUBLICAN PREDECESSORS. BOTH WORKED HARD WITH MY HUSBAND. I WAS DEALING WITH AN ECONOMY THAT WASN'T GOING FAST ENOUGH BUT THEN TOOK OFF WITH 23 MILLION NEW JOBS WITH INCOMES RISING AT EVERY PART OF OUR ECONOMY TOP, MIDDLE, LOW AND INCOME PEOPLE ALL WERE DOING BETTER. WE HANDED OVER A BALANCED BUDGET INTO SURPLUS TO THE REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION AND THEY SQUANDERED IT ALL. NOT ONLY DID THEY CUT TAXES DRAMATICALLY ON THE WEALTHY BUT THEY BASICALLY GOT OUT OF THE WAY OF CORPORATIONS. THEY TOOK THEIR EYE OFF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. THEY DIDN'T PAY A PENNY FOR THE WAR THAT THEY WAGED AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. AND IT TOOK ANOTHER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT WHO YOU WILL HEAR FROM LATER TODAY TO COME IN --  AND ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH HE DID TO TRY TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE THAT HAD BEEN DONE. NOW EVERYTHING I'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE, ALL OF OUR RIGHTS AND HOPES WERE AT RISK. THE REPUBLICANS ONCE AGAIN ARE SUCCESSFUL AT MAKING THE SAME ARGUMENT THEY ALWAYS MAKE. IT'S DISCREDITED AND IT DOESN'T WORK BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP THEM. THEY WILL BE BACK TALKING ABOUT CUTTING TAXES ON THE WEALTHY, GETTING OUT OF THE WAY OF CORPORATIONS. WE KNOW WHAT THAT LEADS TO COME INCREASING INEQUALITY, EXPLOITATION OF WORKERS, POTION OF OUR ENVIRONMENT, DENIAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE, REFUSAL TO MOVE INTO THE 21ST CENTURY WITH CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY, A FAILURE TO PROVIDE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND UNIVERSAL PRE- CASE OF EVERY KID HAS A CHANCE. YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE DEBATE FOR HOURS AND UNFORTUNATELY, SOME OF US HAVE TO.  YOU WON'T HEAR A SINGLE SOLUTION TO ANY OF THE PROBLEMS WE ARE FACING HERE AT HOME OR AROUND THE WORLD. SO MY CAMPAIGN IS REALLY AN EFFORT TO TRY TO BUILD AN AMERICA WHERE EVERYONE WENT IN AND MAN CAN RISE AS FAR AS THEIR TALENT AND HARD WORK TAKE US, WHERE EVERYONE HAS A SHOT AT ACHIEVING",Hillary Clinton at Democratic Women's Leadership Forum

WOW. CLAY, THANK YOU. I KNOW, AS YOU SAID, THIS WAS  NOT EASY TO DO.  BUT THANK YOU. I WANT MORE PEOPLE TO HEAR STORIES LIKE THAT. SO THAT THIS IS NOT JUST SOME  POLITICAL DEBATE ABOUT SOMETHING HAPPENING FAR AWAY. BUT PEOPLE CAN REALLY BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT STANDING IN THE  SHOES OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE. AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE CAN ALL DO TOGETHER. CLAY SURVIVED THAT BRUTAL, HATEFUL ATTACK IN HER OWN HOME.  90 PEOPLE A DAY DON'T SURVIVE BECAUSE OF GUNS. 33,000 PEOPLE A YEAR DIE, BY HOMICIDE, BY SUICIDE, OR BY  ACCIDENTS, USING FIREARMS.  I THINK WE ARE BETTER THAN THAT, AS A NATION. I THINK WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.  THAT IS WHY I HAVE BEEN TALKING  ABOUT IT.  HAVE BEEN LAYING OUT MY  POLICIES TOWARD IT.  SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT WE SHOULD NOT TALK ABOUT IT. SOME SAY WE SHOULD NOT SHOUT ABOUT IT.  THAT I SHOULD NOT SHOUT ABOUT IT.  I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP  TALKING, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE TO ACT.  WE HAVE TO BE WILLING TO TAKE  ON THOSE WHO ARE NOT IN FAVOR  OF SENSIBLE GUN SAFETY MEASURES.  THAT INCLUDES THE NRA. AND IT INCLUDES A OF PEOPLE IN PUBLIC LIFE TODAY, WHO ARE INTIMIDATED. I THINK THAT IS NO LONGER FEASIBLE.  IT'S NO LONGER RIGHT.  WHAT I HAVE SAID IS YES, AS  PRESIDENT, I WILL PUSH AND ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS, SOMETHING THAT THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SUPPORT  AND THE MAJORITY OF GUN OWNERS SUPPORT. SENSIBLE, RESPONSIBLE GUN  OWNERS SUPPORT IT.   THE BRADY BILL HAS  KEPT 2 MILLION GUNS FROM BEING SOLD INTO THE WRONG HANDS. BECAUSE OF THAT BACKGROUND CHECK, DESPITE ITS LOOPHOLES,  PROHIBITED PURCHASERS BECAUSE  THEY WERE FELONS, FUGITIVES, STALKERS, DOMESTIC ABUSERS, PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. HAVE BEEN STOPPED FROM BUYING A GUN. AS BAD AS THE GUN CARNAGE IS, I LIKE TO THINK THAT AT LEAST, 2 MILLION PROHIBITED PURCHASERS WERE NOT PART OF THAT. I ALSO THINK IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO CLOSE THOSE LOOPHOLES. CLOSE THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE AND  THE ONLINE LOOPHOLE. BACK WHEN THE BRADY BILL WAS PASSED IN 1994, ONLINE   PURCHASES WERE NOT AN ISSUE. WE NOW KNOW THEY ARE.  SO WE HAVE TO GO FOR UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND WE HAVE  TO CLOSE THOSE LOOPHOLES.  I HAVE SAID THAT IF THE  CONGRESS DOES NOT COOPERATE, I WOULD USE EXECUTIVE ACTION TO  MAKE SURE THAT SELLERS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I ALSO BELIEVE WE SHOULD CLOSE   WHAT IS NOW BEING CALLED THE   CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE. UNDER THE BACKGROUND CHECKS, IF SOMEONE APPLIES TO BUY A GUN, THE SELLER HAS THREE DAYS, THOSE SELLERS THAT ARE COVERED, TO CONDUCT A BACKGROUND CHECK AND IF IT IS NOT COMPLETED BY  THE END OF THREE DAYS, THE PURCHASER GETS TO BUY THE GUN ANYWAY.  THE REASON IT'S CALLED THE CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE, IS THAT THE KILLER OF THOSE NINE PEOPLE  AT BIBLE STUDY IN MOTHER EMOON   -- EMANUEL CHURCH IN CHAFRLSTON GOT HIS GUN NOT BECAUSE HE WAS ELIGIBLE, BECAUSE IN FACT IT   WAS LEARNED SHORTLY AFTER, HE  WAS NOT ELIGIBLE. HE HAD A FELONY RECORD. BUT BECAUSE OF THIS LOPHOLE HE   -- LOOPHOLE HE WAS ABLE TO GO BACK AT THE END OF THREE DAYS  AND BUY THE GUN HE USED TO KILL  THOSE NINE INNOCENT PEOPLE.  AND THEN FINALLY WE HAVE TO REPEAL THE BROAD IMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO GUN  MANUFACTURERS AND SELLERS IN AMERICA AND --    DRS -- WHICH HAS SHIELDED THEM   FROM ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR SALE OF GUNS AND AMMUNITION FOR -- OR THEIR   MANUFACTURE OF OF EITHER.  NOW, JUST RECENTLY THERE WAS   SOME SMALL SLIMMER OF HOPE WHEN A JURY IN WISCONSIN FOUND A SELLER OF GUNS LIABLE BECAUSE OF A STRAW PURCHASE, WHICH THE SELLER CLEARLY KNEW TO BE A STRAW PURCHASE. A STRAW PURCHASE IS YOU'RE NOT   ELIGIBLE, YOU'RE A FELON, YOU'VE GOT A DOMESTIC ABUSE ORDER AGAINST YOU, YOU'VE BEEN COMMITTED. REMEMBERING THE SHOOTER AT   VIRGINIA TECH HAD BEEN COMMITTED FOR OUTPATIENT TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH, STILL GOT A GUN. BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IN WISCONSIN, THE PROHIBITED  PURCHASER SENT SOMEBODY ELSE IN  WITH A CLEAN RECORD TO BUY THE   GUN FOR HIM. THERE'S VIDEO AND OTHER  EVIDENCE THAT THE SELLER KNEW  THAT THE GUN WAS FOR SOMEBODY ELSE, SOLD IT ANYWAY TO THE  SELLER. BUYS IT, TURNS IT OVER TO THE REAL PURCHASER, WHO GOES OUT AND SHOOTS TWO POLICE OFFICERS. INJURING BOTH SERIOUSLY. AND SO WHEN THE POLICE OFFICER   SUED THE GUN SELLER, THE JURY  HEARD THE EVIDENCE AND CAME IN WITH A VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE   POLICE OFFICERS. NOW, WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHETHER THAT CASE STANDS UP UNDER THE  BROAD IMMUNITY THAT'S BEEN GIVEN TO THE GUN INDUSTRY. THERE IS REALLY NO OTHER   INDUSTRY IN AMERICA THAT HAS THIS KIND OF BLANKET PERMISSION  TO BE RECKLESS, NEGLIGENCE,  SELL DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS EEFPBLET IT'S JUST OUTRAGEOUS  AND WE HAVE TO REPEAL THAT SO  THAT THOSE WHO MANUFACTURE GUNS  AND SELL THEM ARE HELD TO SOME STANDARD OF ACCOUNTABILITY.  SO I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I  CAN IN THIS CAMPAIGN TO NOT  ONLY TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND TO GIVE THE PLATFORM TO PEOPLE   LIKE CLAY, WHO CAN BE MUCH MORE ELOQUENT THAN I EVER CAN ABOUT WHY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE, BUT I'LL ALSO APPEALING TO RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS. ORGANIZE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE   NRA, WHICH IS NOTHING BUT A  LOBBY FOR THE MOST ABSOLUTIST POSITIONS THAT THE GUN   MANUFACTURERS AND SELLERS DEMAND. EACH -- I'LL NOT AGAINST GUNS. MY CAD -- DAD TAUGHT ME TO SHOOT WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.  I'VE EVEN GONE DUCK HUNTING, STANDING IN THE COLD WATER IN THE COLD SUN HD RISE. ONCE -- SUNRISE. ONCE WAS ENOUGH, GETTING IN THAT WATER AND BEETH -- GETTING UP THAT EARLY, I'LL TELL YOU.  BUT THIS IS THE TACTICS THEY   USE, JUST SCARE RESPONSIBLE  FOLKS INTO THINKING THAT THE   BLACK HELICOPTER IS GOING TO   LAND IN THE FRONT YARD AND SOMEBODY IS GOING STHOW -- TO SHOW UP AND TAKE YOUR GNLTSS THAT IS NONINTELLIGENCE --   NONSENSE AND IT NEEDS TO BE  CALLED AUGHT -- OUT FOR WHAT IT  IS. BUT THE FIGHT AGAINST THE N.R.A. SHOULD BE LED BY A NEW  ORGANIZATION OF GUN OWNERS. I'M COLLECT WILLING NAMES OF   PEOPLE WHO ENJOY HUNTING, ENJOY  TARGET SHOOTING BUT ARE SICK AND TIRED OF THE VIOLENCE. SO I AM VERY GRAVE.  TO YOUR SENATOR, MOLLY KELLY, AND TO CLAY FOR SHARING WHAT SAY VERY PAINFUL PERSONAL STORY TO TRY TO SAVE LIVES AND I   REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING   WITH A GROUNDSWELL OF PEOPLE   CROSS OUR COUNTRY WHO KNOW WE  CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. SO WITH THAT, LET ME THROW THIS  OPEN TO QUESTIONS ON WHATEVER  ISSUES OR CONCERNS YOU MIGHT HAVE.  ARE LET ME SAY THIS. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT HE COULD   HAVE GONE PUBLIC AND RELEASED  THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON AMERICANS UNDER WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION AND HE COULD HAVE   DONE IT WITHIN THE TRADITION IN  OUR COUNTRY THAT SHIELDS PEOPLE  WHO COME FORTH ACTING OUT OF CONSCIENCE TO PRESENT  INFORMATION THAT THEY BELIEVE  THE PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE.  I DO NOT KNOW WHY IN ADDITION TO RELEASING THE INFORMATION   THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO HE FELT COMPELLED TO STEAL A LOT  OF INFORMATION AND -- THAT BY  ANY DEFINITION HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS, LIBERTIES AND PRIVACY BUT  INSTEAD WERE ABOUT TREFTS AND WHAT OTHER NATIONS -- JUST TO NAME TWO, CHINA AND RUSSIA -- DO TO GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT   US AND WHAT OUR GOVERNMENT DOES  TO TRY TO PREVENT THAT AND TO  GET INFORMATION ABOUT THEM.  SO IF HE HAD BEEN A  WHISTLEBLOWER AND IF HE HAD CONFINED HIMSELF TO RELEASING INFORMATION THAT I THINK DID PROVOKE THE RIGHT KIND OF  DISCUSSION IN OUR COUNTRY AND HAS LED TO SOME CHANGES WHICH I  APPROVE OF THEN I THINK PEOPLE   COULD ACROSS ALL SPECTRUMS SAY   HEY, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING  THIS TO OUR ATTENTION AND THANK  YOU FOR GICK US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPOFPBLETD BECAUSE HE TOOK  VALUABLE INFORMATION AND WENT FIRST TO CHINE THAT -- CHINE HA  -- CHINA AND THEN IS NOW UNDER THE PROTECTION OF VLADIMIR PUTIN, I THINK THAT RAISES A   LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT   EVERYTHING ELSE HE DID.  SO I DO NOT THINK HE SHOULD ESCAPE HAVING TO RETURN AND  ANSWER FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE. I THINK, THOUGH, WE NEED TO CONTINUE THE BALANCE ON CIVIL  RIGHTS, PRIVACY AND SECURITY. IT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE AND I  WOULD -- I DO SUPPORT WHAT THE PONG PASSED, THE U.S.A. FREEDOM  ACT BECAUSE I THINK IT DID HAVE  SOME GOOD CHANGES AND WE HAVE TO REMAIN VIGILANT.  BUT IT'S A BALANCE.  IT'S NOT ALL ONE-SIDED.  IF YOU GO TOO FAR TOWARD   SECURITY YOU DO INFRINGE ON THE LEGITIMATE RIGHT OF AMERICANS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO END. IF YOU GO TOO FAR TOWARD PRIVACY AND, YOU KNOW, SIRTS,  YOU CAN -- CIVIL LIBERTIES, YOU  CAN LEAVE US VULNERABLE, AND WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT --   PREVENT THAT, TOO. I -- SO THAT'S THE KIND OF HARD-CHOICE BALANCING ACT I  THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN   ATTEMPTING TO DO AND I SUPPORT   CHANGES HE HAS BEEN MAKING FROM THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL AND I  SUPPORT THE NEW LEGISLATION THAT THE CONGRESS PASSED. NOW JUST A MINUTE, SIR.  JUST A MINUTE. I'LL GET TO YOU, I PROMISE.  BUT I KIND OF LIKE TO GO IN A  BROAD SWEEP. BUT OK, YOU STOOD UP.  WE'LL HEAR FROM YOU. WHERE IS THE MICROPHONE. JUST A MIFMENT I MEAN IT'S GREAT HAVING PEOPLE SO EAGER.  I AGREE WITH  YOU ON THAT AND I LIKE TO REFER  TO WHAT I'M ADVOCATING AS GUN SAFETY MEASURES AND THE GENTLEMAN PAKEDS A VERY GOOD   POINT. LIKE SO MANY OF YOU, I AM READING NEWS ON LINE AND I SEED A HEADLINE, I THINK IT WAS IN THE ""WASHINGTON POST,"" WHICH SAID SOME, AS I RECALL,  ""TODDLERS ARE KILLING MORE   PEOPLE WITH GUNS."" I STOPPED AND WENT, WHAT? WHY? BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHOSE HOMES   THEY LIVE IN.  MOSTLY THEIR PARENTS, SOMETIMES THEIR GRANDPARENTS, HAVE LOADED  GUNS IN THEIR HOMES, IN THEIR  CARS AND CHILDREN ARE CURIOUS! THED TOLER IN THE BACK SEAT  PICK THE BEGUN AND SHOOTING HIS GRANDMOTHER. AND THE GENTLEMAN IS BUHL RIGHT. IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A GUN, PLEASE, PLEASE EXERCISE GUN SAFETY AND KEEP THOSE AWAY FROM TODDLERS, YOUNG KIDS AND TEACH A PROPER RESPECT FOR GUNS. ONE OF THE WORST CASES I HAVE READ ABOUT IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS IS THAT AN 11-YEAR-OLD   BOY ASKED TO SEE THE NEW PUPPY   OF THE 8-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO LIVED NEAR HIM AND THE LITTLE GIRL BHOR WHATEVER REASON SAID   NO, SHE DIDN'T WANT HIM TO SEE   THE PUPPY. HE WENT HOME, GOT HIS FATHER'S   LOADED SHOTGUN, HE WENT BACK   AND HE KILLED HER. SO I'LL -- ALL I'M ASK I THINK IS PRETTY COMMON SENSE.  WE NEED NEW LEGISLATION TO   CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES TO REMOVE  THE IMMUNITY FROM LIABILITY, TO  USE TECHNOLOGY TO GET INSTANT  BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR REAL, NOT  JUST SAYING IT, BUT ULTIMATELY PEOPLE, PEOPLE HAVE TO EXERCISE  COMMON SENSE IN DEALING WITH   THESE WEAPONS. AND KEEPING THEM AWAY FROM   CHILDREN. SHOULD BE RULE NUMBER ONE IN MY  OPINION. SO THANK YOU.  THANK YOU. THIS GENTLEMAN RIGHT THERE IN  THE GRAY.  LET'S GIVE  THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION A LOT BE CREDIT FOR THEIR ENERGY AND   CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY. THEY'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH   THIS AND HAVE BEGUN TO COME OUT  WITH RECOMMENDED REGULATIONS LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, TO CONTROL METHANE EMISSIONS. I THINK YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE VERY TOUGH WATER STANDARDS. I THINK, FROM TALKING TO EXPERTS IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, AND ON THE OUTSIDE, HERE IS WHAT THEY HAVE  CONVINCED ME OF. THIS IS THE FOLLOWING. THERE ARE SOME PLACES IN OUR COUNTRY WHERE THIS EXTRACTION  TECHNIQUE MAY BE APPROPRIATE IF  WE DO MORE RESEARCH, AND FIGURE  OUT HOW TO CUT THE METHANE EMISSIONS, AND KEEP THE WATER  CLEAN. THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER PLACES WHERE IT IS NOT. PART OF WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO START DOING IS DRAWING SOME LINES AND INFORMING STATES AND LOCALITIES, AND WE  SHOULD ALSO NEVER PREEMPT STATES AND LOCALITIES FROM SAYING NO. IF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT SAYS, NO,  NOT HERE, THEY SHOULD BE ABLE  TO DO THAT.    PART OF THE REASON  WHY I THINK THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION EXPERTS HAVE  TAKEN THIS POSITION IS WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH A TRANSITION.  WE HAVE TO MOVE AWAY FROM  FOSSIL FUELS, INCLUDING GAS. GAS CAN BE A USEFUL BRIDGE,  ESPECIALLY IF WE MOVE AWAY FROM  COAL, AND DIRTIER OIL, AND SOME  OF THE REALLY BAD  ALTERNATIVES. WE WANT TO KEEP MORE FOSSIL FUELS IN THE OCEAN AND UNDER THE GROUND.  THAT IS WHY I AM AGAINST ARCTIC  DRILLING AND OFFSHORE DRILLING.  BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD  START THAT.  I'M TRYING TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO I KNOW CARE A LOT ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE  CHANGE, AND THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE SMART STEPS WE CAN TAKE.  IN SOME INSTANCES, I CAN GO  ALONG WITH THAT, AND OTHERS, I CAN'T. WE NEED TO BE MOVING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO 100% CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY. WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO, BUT  THAT SHOULD BE OUR GOAL, AND WE SHOULD DO NOTHING TO UNDERMINE OR INTERFERE IN OUR EFFORTS TO REACH THAT GOAL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.    THE LADY IN GREEN RIGHT THERE. THIS LADY RIGHT THERE?  YOU HAVE MADE A VERY IMPORTANT POINT.  I DID NOT REALLY FOCUS ON THIS UNTIL I'VE BEEN TRAVELING  AROUND NEW HAMPSHIRE.  THE CONCERNS THAT RESIDENTS  HAVE EXPRESSED ABOUT FERC  REALLY ARE LEGITIMATE. THE PROCESS THAT FERC'S  EMPLOYED DOES NOT REALLY GIVE  ENOUGH WEIGHT TO PUBLIC  OPINION, AND LOCATIONS WHERE PIPELINES ARE GOING  THROUGH. IT DOES NOT PAY, IN MY OPINION,  I ENOUGH ATTENTION TO ALL OF THE OTHER ISSUES, WHETHER THEY BE HEALTH ISSUES, SAFETY ISSUES, AND THE LIKE.  I'M GOING TO DO WHAT I CAN TO TRY TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY THE  CASE THAT FERC HAS TO, IN ANY OF THESE DECISIONS, PAY MUCH MORE ATTENTION TO LOCAL  COMMUNITIES, AND LISTEN TO WHAT  YOUR CONCERNS ARE, AND DO MUCH MORE TO EVALUATE WHATEVER THE  CONSEQUENCES, OR THE DOWNSIDES OF THESE DECISIONS ARE. RIGHT NOW, THEIR MANDATE SEEMS TO BE ONLY ABOUT DELIVERY OF ENERGY ANYWHERE, ANYTIME.  I DON'T THINK THAT IS ADEQUATE IN TODAY'S WORLD.  IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE -- WHAT?    THAT'S NOT -- LET'S NOT CONFUSE THE TWO ISSUES. WHEN YOU SAY SUPPORTED, THEY ARE NOT PAID FOR BY OIL AND GAS. THEY ARE CERTAINLY, AT AS A REGULATOR FOR OIL AND GAS, USED  TO PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT THE  OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY DOES. I WILL ABSOLUTELY GIVE YOU THAT.  SEE, MY PROBLEM, NOW THAT  PEOPLE HAVE RAISED THIS WITH ME, IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A  NATIONAL COMMITMENT TO DO  SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE,  FERC HAS TO BE PART OF THAT  NATIONAL COMMITMENT. THAT IS MY VIEW ON HOW WE HAVE TO ALTER A LOT OF PARTS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.  YOU KNOW, IT IS NOT JUST THE EPA THAT NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED ON  COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE, EVERY  PART OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED. BECAUSE I WANT TO HAVE A NATIONAL GOAL THEI SAID, LOOK,   I WANT TO HAVE,  BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM, HALF A MILLION SOLAR PANELS  INSTALLED, AND BY THE END OF MY  TERM, ENOUGH RENEWABLE ENERGY  TO POWER EVERY HOME IN AMERICA. IF THOSE ARE OUR GOALS, IT IS  REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT HAND DOING  SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN THE LEFT HAND, IN THE OLD SAYING.  IT WOULD BE MY INTENTION, IF REGULATORY CHANGES ARE NECESSARY, TO UNDERTAKE THOSE, BUT ALSO APPOINT PEOPLE WHO  WILL BE REALLY FOCUSED ON HOW  EVERYONE WORKS TOWARDS THIS  BIG, OVERARCHING, NATIONAL GOAL.  AND NOT HAVE, YOU KNOW, KIND OF HAVE ""OLD-THINK."" THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE NEEDED MORE ENERGY. SOME OF US ARE ABLE TO REMEMBER.  BEING IN VERY LONG GAS LINES,  AT LEAST I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS.  WE WERE PRETTY MUCH CAPTIVE TO MIDDLE EAST OIL. WE HAD A DIFFERENT MINDSET.  NOW, WE HAVE TO CHANGE THAT.  I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS NOT ONLY A SPECIFIC WHAT ABOUT A PARTICULAR DECISION, BUT IT  RAISES A LARGER ISSUE ABOUT  WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TO CHANGE OUR VALUES, OUR GOALS. THAT IS WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY TO DO.  GREAT QUESTION.  LET ME ASK, HOW MANY IN THIS ROOM CURRENTLY HAVE STUDENT DEBT? WOW! KEEP YOUR HANDS UP.  HOW MANY HAVE EVER HAD STUDENT DEBT?  THAT IS A HEALTHY MAJORITY HERE.  THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION.  YOUR STATISTICS ARE RIGHT. WE HAVE 40 MILLION PEOPLE WITH STUDENT DEBT THAT NOW REACHES  $1.2 TRILLION. THE FIRST THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WE NEED TO MAKE IT  POSSIBLE FOR EVERY PERSON WITH STUDENT DEBT, CURRENT, AND THOSE WHO HAVE GRADUATED,  REFINANCE THAT DEBT. YOU KNOW, THAT, TO ME, IS THE NUMBER ONE ABOUT GOAL. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, EVERYONE ELSE CAN REFINANCE THEIR DEBT. CORPORATIONS CAN REFINANCE   THEIR DEBT.  YOU CAN REFINANCE YOUR MORTGAGE, YOUR CAR PAYMENT.  WHY IS IT THAT STUDENTS CANNOT REFINANCE THEIR DEBT?  THE WORST INJUSTICE TO ME IS THAT WE HAVE HAD 0% INTEREST RATES FOR YEARS. I WANT TO ASK, HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE PAYING AN  INTEREST RATE OF AT LEAST 7%? YEAH.  WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING INTEREST RATES FAR BEYOND WHAT THE REAL INTEREST RATES ARE. SO I WNT EVERYBODY TO BE ABLE TO REFINANCE. AND THEN I WANT EVERYBODY TO BE ABLE TO DO MUCH MORE TO GET INTO INCOME CONTINGENCY REPAYMENT PLANS. WHAT IS THAT? THIS IS WHAT I HAD WHEN I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL, SO DID MY HUSBAND. WE BOTH BORROWED MONEY. WE WORKED, WE BORROWED MONEY. THE LOANS WE HAD, WHEN WE  GRADUATED, WE BOTH WERE  TEACHERS.  WE TAUGHT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS LAW SCHOOL. MY FIRST JOB WAS WITH THE  CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND, AND THEN WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS.  I RECALL MAKING BETWEEN  $14,000-$17,000 PER YEAR.  WE COULDN'T HAVE PAID SOME BIG   FIXED RATE BASED ON A HIGH   INTEREST RATE. WE PAID ON A POLY ABOUT, AS I  RECALL IT WAS LIKE 10%,IT TOOK   15 YEARS.  IT DID NOT HAVE THE BURDEN THAT  I HEAR ABOUT BECAUSE OF THE  HIGH FIXED RATES.  THE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO  DO MORE OF HIS MAKE SURE THAT  PEOPLE WHO GO INTO OUR PUBLIC  SERVICE AND NATIONAL SERVICE JOBS GET A LOWER RATE, MORE  FORGIVENESS FASTER, AND A DISCOUNT BECAUSE THEY ARE DOING  SOMETHING THAT SERVE THEIR COMMUNITY.   THEN, TO HAVE A DATE CERTAIN WHEN THEIR OBLIGATIONS AND. IF YOU HAVE BEEN A RESPONSIBLE PAYER AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT I  WILL PROVIDE, THERE WILL BE AN ENDPOINT, AND YOU CAN TELL ON THAT.  -- COUNT ON THAT.  THIS IS A BIG DEAL TO ME BECAUSE TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING HELD BACK BECAUSE OF THIS DEBT.  YOU SAY $32,000 -- THAT IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST AVERAGES IN THE COUNTRY. STUDENTS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE  BEARING. IT IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR  EVERYBODY, BUT PARTICULARLY FOR STUDENTS HERE, AND I HAVE MET A  LOT OF THEM, WHO BECAUSE OF THEIR STUDENT DEBT, CANNOT TAKE JOBS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO TAKE, BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD THEM. I MET A YOUNG WOMAN WHO SAID SHE HAD THE JOB OF HER LIFE IN BOSTON, BUT SHE COULD NOT AFFORD TO PAY HER STUDENT DEBT,  AND LIVE THERE, SO LIKE SO MANY STUDENTS TODAY, SHE IS STILL LIVING WITH HER PARENTS. THAT IS NICE, BUT YOU DESERVE THE CHANCE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE YOU WILL LIVE AND WORK. AND ALL OF REST OF IT. THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO DO. M    I WILL MAKE A VERY  HIGH PRIORITY. OK.  WHAT DOES THAT SAY?  OH, YOU ARE FROM MOUNT HOLYOKE. OH A FELLOW SEVEN SISTER.  DOES THAT MEAN YOU WANT TO ASK A MOUNT HOLYOKE QUESTION?  I COULD SEE YOU HOLDING UP, AND I HAD TO GET CLOSE TO READ IT.  WITH RESPECT TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION, HUMAN TRAFFICKING, I FEEL  PASSIONATELY ABOUT THIS, AND -- I FEEL PASSIONATELY ABOUT   THIS AND HAVE WORKED ON THIS   ISSUE SINCE MY DAYS AS FIRST LADY.  IN FACT, BACK IN 2000, I WORKED  WITH A COALITION OF OUTSIDE ACTIVISTS AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO PASS THE FIRST EVER  UNITED STATES LEGISLATION  AGAINST HUMAN TRAFFICKING. PROUD TO SAY MY HUSBAND SIGNED   SO THAT BEGAN OUR EFFORTS ON   HUMAN TRAFFICKING.   I STAYED FOCUSED  ON THAT AS SENATOR, AND THEN AS SECRETARY OF STATE, WORKED REALLY HARD TO DO MORE ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AROUND THE WORLD, AND HERE AT HOME. WE APPOINTED A FIRST-RATE FEDERAL PROSECUTOR WHO HAD PROSECUTED SOME OF THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES IN THE UNITED STATES, TO HEAD THE OFFICE IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO TAKE ON THESE ISSUES. WE ALSO PRESSURED, THROUGH THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING ANNUAL STUDY, DIFFERENT COUNTRIES TO CHANGE THEIR LAWS AND TO ENFORCE THEIR LAWS. AS FIRST LADY, I TALKED TO OTHER COUNTRIES, AND THEY DID  NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE UNITED  STATES WAS MAKING A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS. IT WAS PART OF, IN THEIR VIEW, THE CULTURE. NOW, THEY KNOW THAT THEY WILL  BE GRADED EVERY YEAR BY THE  UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, AND  THAT IF THEY ARE HAVING A  FAILING GRADE SEVERAL YEARS IN A ROW, THEY CAN LOSE AID AND OTHER BENEFITS FROM THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. IT IS OUR TOOL TO GET LAWS PASSED, AND FORCED, AND GO AFTER HUMAN TRAFFICKING. IT REMAINS ONE OF THE BIGGEST  SOURCES OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND PROFITS IN THE WORLD.  SOMETIMES WE THINK OF ONE OR TWO KINDS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING -- THE REFUGEES FLOODING INTO  EUROPE ARE IN MANY RESPECTS A  FORM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THEY'RE PICKED UP BY SMUGGLERS   WHO OFTEN ABANDON THEM.  THE CHILDREN AND ADULTS THAT COME ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER  ARE OFTEN TREATED THE SAME WAY. THEIR FAMILIES PAY MONEY TO  SMUGGLERS AND TRAFFICKERS, WHO,  AGAIN, MAY ABANDON THEM, ABANDONED THEM IN THE DESERT.  WE HAVE A LOT OF TRAFFICKING OF  PEOPLE INTO REALLY EXPLOITED LABOR SITUATION, LITERALLY PEOPLE BEING KIDNAPPED AND PUT ON FISHING BOATS, BEING CHANGED  IT -- CHAINED  TO SEWING MACHINES IN  FACTORIES, AND OF COURSE, WE HAVE SEX TRAFFICKING, WEHAVE   POOR FAMILIES WHO ARE ESSENTIALLY CONVINCED TO SELL THEIR DAUGHTERS. I REMEMBER BEING IN NORTHERN THAILAND, WHEN I WAS FIRST LADY, AND IT WAS BEFORE WE PASSED OUR TRAFFICKING STATUTE. PART OF THE REASON I WAS THERE WAS TO TALK TO THE GOVERNMENT TO CONVINCE THEM TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. I WENT TO A HOSPICE FOR YOUNG WOMEN, WHO WERE THE VICTIMS OF AIDS, AFTER HAVING BEEN TRAFFICKED INTO THE BROTHELS IN  BANGKOK, AND THEN, WHEN THEY WERE ILL, WERE THROWN LITERALLY ON THE STREET. SOME OF THEM WOULD MAKE THEIR WAY BACK TO THEIR HOMES. THEIR FAMILIES, WHO HAD BEEN PAID FOR THEM, WOULD REJECT THEM. I REMEMBER STANDING BY THE WHEELCHAIR OF A DYING 12 EURO  GIRL, AND HAVING THE AID WORKERS, WHO WERE TAKING CARE  OF HER, TELL ME HER STORY. THE AID WORKERS SAID, YOU CAN  TELL THAT FAMILIES WHO HAVE  SOLD THEIR DAUGHTERS, BY DRIVING AROUND THESE VILLAGES  -- THE HUTS, THE HOUSES, THE SATELLITES SOLD THEIR DAUGHTERS. THIS IS A DEEP PART OF THE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS, A REJECTION OF THEIR  IMPORTANCE, THEIR HUMAN  DIGNITY, THEIR RIGHTS, THAT IT IS A DEEP CHALLENGE TO  CHANGE ATTITUDES IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD ABOUT THE VALUE OF  GIRLS, AND MAKE THE CASE THAT  EDUCATING A GIRL, OVER THE LONG  RUN, WILL BE FAR BETTER FOR THE  FAMILY, THEN SELLING HER AT THE  AGE OF 11 OR 12, TO BE EITHER  AN INDENTURED SERVANT, OR A SEX WORKER.  THIS IS AN AREA THAT IS  PARTICULARLY A CONCERN OF MINE BECAUSE IT GOES HAND-IN-HAND WITH THE EXULTATION OF POOR  -- EXPLOITATION OF INFERIOR OF POOR PEOPLE, MARGINALIZED PEOPLE   AND PARTICULARLY GIRLS AND WOMEN IN MANY PLACES ACROSS THE  COUNTRY. THANK YOU.  AUSTRALIA IS A  GOOD EXAMPLE, CANADA IS A GOOD EXAMPLE, THE U.K. IS A GOOD  EXAMPLE. WHY? EACH OF THEM HAVE HAD MASS KILLINGS.  AUSTRALIA HAD A HUGE MASS  KILLING ABOUT 25, 20 OR 25   YEARS AGO. CANADA DID AS WELL, SO DID DID   THE U.K. IN REACTION, THE PASSED MUCH STRICTER GUN LAWS. IN THE AUSTRALIAN EXAMPLE, AS I  RECALL, THAT WAS A BUYBACK PROGRAM. AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, AS PART OF TRYING TO CLAMP DOWN ON THE AVAILABILITY OF AUTOMATIC  WEAPONS, OFFERED A GOOD PRICE  FOR BUYING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF GUNS. THEN, THEY BASICALLY CLAMPS  DOWN, GOING FORWARD, IN TERMS  OF HAVING MORE OF A BACKGROUND CHECK APPROACH, MORE OF A PERMITTING APPROACH, BUT THEY BELIEVE, AND I THINK THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THEM THAT BY OFFERING TO BUY BACK THE GUNS, THEY WERE ABLE TO CURTAIL THE SUPPLY, AND SET A DIFFERENT STANDARD FOR GUN PURCHASES IN THE FUTURE.  COMMUNITIES HAVE DONE THAT IN  OUR COUNTRY. SEVERAL COMMUNITIES HAVE DONE GUN BUYBACK PROGRAMS.  I FIGURE WOULD BE WORTH  CONSIDERING DOING IT ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL, IF THAT COULD BE ARRANGED. AFTER THE TERRIBLE 2008  FINANCIAL CRISIS, ONE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA  WAS ABLE TO GET IN PLACE WAS CASH FOR CLUNKERS. YOU REMEMBER THAT? IT WAS PARTIALLY A WAY TO GET  PEOPLE TO BUY NEW CARS, AND TO GET OLD MODELS, THAT WERE  POLLUTING TOO MUCH, OFF THE ROAD.  I THINK THAT IS WORTH  CONSIDERING. I DO NOT KNOW ENOUGH DETAIL TO TELL YOU HOW WE WOULD DO IT, OR  HOW IT WOULD WORK, BUT CERTAINLY DUST ARE YOU EXAMPLE IS WORTH LOOKING AT.   YES, RIGHT  THERE. HERE COMES THE MICROPHONE.  I'M GLAD YOU WILL BE A TEACHER.  I HAVE TO SAY,  KEENE STATE HAS A WELL-DESERVED REPUTATION FOR TURNING OUT EDUCATORS. AND I WANT TO RALPLAUD KEANE STATE FACULTY AND STUDENTS.    I COULD TALK ABOUT IS A LONG TIME.  I WILL TRY TO BE MORE FOCUSED. FIRST OF ALL, I THINK WE HAVE  TO DO MORE TO ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT EDUCATORS TELL US ABOUT WHAT WILL WORK IN  THE CLASSROOMS.  THAT SOUNDS SO  OBVIOUS THAT SOME OF YOU ARE PROBABLY WONDERING, WHY WOULD  SHE SAY SOMETHING SO OBVIOUS? IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN HAVING A VERY FIGURES DEBATE, A  CONTENTIOUS DEBATE, OVER WHAT  WILL WORK AND WHAT WILL NOT  WORK TO TRY TO INCREASE  EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT AMONG  OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.  I THINK THE DEBATE HAS GOTTEN  OFF BASE.  I THINK IT IS TOO MUCH ABOUT THE LATEST FADS, THE LATEST  PRODUCTS, THE LATEST MODELS, INSTEAD OF TAKING A DEEP BREATH, AND ACTUALLY TALKING TO  EXPERTS THAT HAVE DONE AN  ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF RESEARCH  ABOUT WHAT REALLY WORKS. I WANT TO GET BACK TO WHAT REALLY WORKS. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF WELL-MEANING PEOPLE WHO ARE  REALLY DOWN ON THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE OR SURE THAT -- OR SHARE THAT. I THINK PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE THE BEDROCK INSTITUTION OF OUR DEMOCRACY.   WE NEED TO DO MORE  TO MAKE THEM WORK. HERE ARE A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS BECAUSE THIS IS A MUCH LONGER CONVERSATION.  I MUST SAY, I AM HONORED TO  HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE  TEACHERS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND  AMERICA IN MY CAMPAIGN.    BECAUSE OF THAT, I WANT TO BE A PARTNER IN  FIGURING OUT WHAT ARE THE BEST WAY FORWARD TO DO A BETTER JOB,  HELPING KIDS, PARTICULARLY POOR  KIDS, KIDS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS, KIDS THAT COMMENT TO SCHOOL  -- WHO COME IN TO SCHOOL FROM LITERALLY THE FIRST DAY OF  KINDERGARTEN NOT AS PREPARED AS  THEIR CLASSMATES ARE TO BE SUCCESSFUL.  I START WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND UNIVERSAL FREE KINDERGARTEN. THAT'S WHERE I START.    I THINK IT IS A GREAT DISSERVICE TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF LIFE SET OF THE CHILD, SET UP THE VOCABULARY OF THE CHILD -- WE NOW KNOW FROM BRAIN RESEARCH -- EVEN INFLUENCES THE BRAIN AND WAYS THAT WILL BE EASIER, LESS SO, AND LEARNING  -- IN LEARNING. THE BRAIN RESEARCH TELLS US THAT 80% OF YOUR BRAIN IS  PHYSICALLY FORMED BY THE AGE OF THREE. WHAT HAPPENS IN THOSE FIRST  THREE YEARS AND THEN FIRST FIVE  YEARS BEFORE YOU GO INTO A FORMAL CLASSROOM REALLY DEPENDS  ON THE FAMILY AND THE  COMMUNITY, AND WHAT KINDS OF SUPPORT FAMILIES CAN BE GIVEN. I AM A STRONG BELIEVER IN EARLY  EDUCATION, PARTICULARLY FOR  KIDS THAT HAVE VARIOUS KINDS OF  DISADVANTAGES. I WILL JUST TELL YOU A QUICK STORY. WHEN BILL WAS GOVERNOR OF  ARKANSAS, ONE OF OUR PROBLEMS  WAS -- IT WAS, YOU KNOW, THE SECOND POOREST STATE IN  AMERICA, AND THE TEACHERS WERE THE SECOND POOREST PAID IN AMERICA. A LOT OF THE FAMILIES HAD  REALLY SERIOUS ECONOMIC  CHALLENGES. WHEN YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT, WHAT YOU DO TO TRY TO IMPROVE  THE SCHOOLS? WE TACKLED STANDARDS, WE RAISED  TEACHER PAY, WE DID A LOT THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE THAT WAS OVERDUE, BUT WE ALSO LOOK TO THIS PROBLEM ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS  WHEN KIDS SHOW UP THAT FIRST DAY. AS A RESULT, I BEGAN LOOKING ALL OVER TO TRY TO FIND AN AFFORDABLE PROGRAM THAT COULD HELP MORE LOW INCOME KIDS BE BETTER PREPARED. A LOT OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE THE REAL STATE OF THE ART ARE EXPENSIVE. I WOULD LOVE FOR OUR COUNTRY TO  INVEST IN THEM BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY SAVE MONEY AT THE END OF IT -- THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BUT BEING REALISTIC, WE GOT TO TRY TO FIND EVERYTHING WE CAN  DO AND MAKE IT AFFORDABLE. THIS WAS SO SERENDIPITOUS. I WAS IN FLORIDA WITH BILL.  WE WERE ATTENDING SOME MEETING THAT HE HAD. I WAS LITERALLY IN THE HOTEL ROOM, FLIPPING THROUGH THE PAPER, AND I SAW A PICTURE OF A  PROFESSOR FROM ISRAEL GIVING A LECTURE ABOUT PROGRAM THEY HAD STARTED THERE. I READ ABOUT IT. IT WAS FASCINATING. IT BASICALLY SAID THAT AFTER A BIG INFLUX OF IMMIGRANTS FROM LE POOR NATIONS LIKE ETHIOPIA, THE KIDS WOULD GO TO THE EXCELLENT ISRAELI SCHOOLS, BUT THEY WERE NOT ACHIEVING. THE RESEARCHERS WOULD SAY, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, THEY ARE IN THE SCHOOLS, IS THE SCHOOLS ARE THE ONLY ANSWER, WHY AREN'T  THEY DOING BETTER? THEY REALIZE THAT THEY HAD TO  WORK IN THE FAMILY IN THOSE  FIRST FIVE YEARS.  I CALLED THIS WOMAN. I SAID, DR. LOMBARD, I'M HILLARY CLINTON, CALLING FROM ARKANSAS.  SHE SAID, WHERE? I SAID, ARKANSAS.  SHE SAID, WHERE IS THAT? I SAID, NEXT TO TEXAS, LOOK AT A MAP. I SAID, IF SHE WAS COMING TO THE UNITED STATES, IF I COULD  MEET WITH HER. TO FIGURE OUT IF WHAT THEY DID IN ISRAEL WAS TRANSFERABLE TO THE UNITED STATES. SHE CAME. WE BEGAN WHAT IS CALLED HOME INSTRUCTION PROGRAM FOR YOUNGSTERS.  THE IDEA BEHIND IT IS TO HELP  THE MOTHER BECOME HER CHILD'S  FIRST TEACHER. TO FEEL CONFIDENT AND COMPETENT  ENOUGH TO PREPARE HER OWN CHILD  TO LEARN, DOING SIMPLE THINGS  LIKE TALKING TO HER BABY.  A LOT OF LOW INCOME MOTHERS -- WHEN I STARTED DOING THIS BACK  IN THE 1980'S, I SAID, I BET YOU ARE LOVING TALKING TO YOUR BABY, AND SHE SAID, WHY WOULD I  TALK TO HER, SHE WILL NOT TALK BACK.  NOT BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T LOVE HER BABY, BUT BECAUSE SHOORS -- BECAUSE SHE HAD NO IDEA THAT IS HOW YOU BUILD SYNAPSES AND VOCABULARY. FAST FORWARD, THIS HAS BEEN  GOING ON FOR 25 YEARS, AND HAS A GREAT TRACK RECORD. WE COULD DO MORE IN THE HOMES  HELPING MOTHERS BECOME THEIR CHILD'S FIRST TEACHER, BUT WE  STILL NEED UNIVERSAL PREKINDERGARTEN SO THAT EVERY KENDRICK CAN GET THAT LEVEL OF PREPARATION SO THAT WHEN THEY GO TO THAT FIRST DAY OF  KINDERGARTEN, THEY WILL HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE TO BE  SUCCESSFUL.  I WILL AND THERE -- END THEIR  SAYING I'M REALLY LOOKING  FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE TEACHERS OF AMERICA TO MAKE OUR  EDUCATION SYSTEM EVERYTHING IT   SHOULD BE. OK, BACK HERE.  I HAVE TO SAY, YOU  ARE THE THIRD GRANDMOTHER THAT I HAVE PERSONALLY MET IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT IS RAISING A  GRANDCHILD BECAUSE OF DRUGS. WE DID HAVE AN INCREDIBLE TOWN HALL HERE, DIDN'T WE?  600-700 PEOPLE, MOST OF THEM REALLY AFFECTED IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER BY THIS TERRIBLE EPIDEMIC OF ADDICTION. IN PARTICULAR, HERE NEW  HAMPSHIRE, AND NEXT-DOOR IN VERMONT, HEROIN. THE HEROIN EPIDEMIC, WHICH IS  KILLING SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE,  AND LEAVING GRIEVING AND BROKEN  FAMILIES BEHIND. I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE HAD I NOT SPENT SEVERAL MONTHS LISTENING TO PEOPLE. IN IOWA, ON MY FIRST TRIP, IN  THIS CAMPAIGN, AND THEN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, IN KEENE, ON MY FIRST TRIP, I HEARD ABOUT THE HAIR WHEN EPIDEMIC -- HEROIN EPIDEMIC. SO I BEGAN LOOKING INTO IT. ND I KNOW THAT EVERYWHERE I WENT, SOMEONE RAISED IT WITH ME. SOMETIMES PUBLICLY, SOMETIMES AFTERWARDS, PRIVATELY. THAT'S WHY I HAVE A  COMPREHENSIVE AGENDA, TO TRY TO  REVERSE, TO BEGIN TO REVERSE   THIS TIDE OF ADDICTION THEIT   INCLUDES BETTER PREVENTIVE EFFORTS, MORE TREATMENT, SOMETHING WE JUST DO NOT HAVE  ENOUGH OF. IF YOU DO HAVE SOMEBODY, AND PERSUADE THEM TO SEEK  TREATMENT, ONLY ONE IN 10 WILL GET IT IN A TIMELY WAY.  WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH OF IT.  WE ARE ALSO SEEING REAL PROGRESS.  I HAD A MEETING ABOUT THIS ISSUE, AND I WAS SO IMPRESSED  BY THE POLICE CHIEF WHO HAS  CHANGED THE WHOLE WAY HE POLICES DRUG ABUSE AND OFFENSES.  INSTEAD OF SENDING PEOPLE TO JAIL, THEY ARE TRYING TO GET THEM TREATMENT.  THEY'RE TRYING TO MATCH THEM WITH SOME SORT OF MENTOR FROM  THE RECOVERY COMMUNITY.  THEY ARE NOW EQUIPPED WITH THE ANTIDOTE TORY VERSE HEROIN OVERDOSES. SO WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY WE POLICE.  WE NEED FOR MORE DRUG COURTS.  DRUG COURTS ARE FOR MORE COST-EFFECTIVE THAN PROBLEM. WE SEND A LOT OF PEOPLE TO   PRISON FOR MINOR DRUG A -- OFFENSES, THEY COME OUT FULL-BLOWN ADDICTS WE JUST ARE GOING AT THIS, I THINK, BACKWARDS. SO I AM MAKING THIS AN ISSUE BECAUSE I REALLY BELIEVE IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH YIRB89 AS I TALKED ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO UP IN BOSTON WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND WITH THE MAYOR, YOU KNOW, MAYOR WALSH IS A RECORING  -- RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC AND VERY WILLING TO PAULK -- TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT IF SOMEONE IN HIS POSITION DOESN'T TALK ABOUT IT, HOW IS  SOMEONE TO KNOW THAT THERE IS  SOMETHING THEY CAN DO, SOME PATH FORWARD?  BUT FOR ME IT'S REALLY ABOUT   THE LIVES THAT ARE AFFECTED AND  ALL THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO  HELP THEIR LOVED ONE OR COPE   WITH THE FACT THAT THEY CAN'T  HELP OR THAT THAT PERSON IS NO LONGER AROUND. SO I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH YOUR   RAISING THIS BECAUSE WE'RE   GOING TO KEEP TALKING GOOD AND   TRY TO DO MORE ABOUT IT. THANK YOU.  YOU KNOW, I TRY TO BE FAIR BY GOING IN THIS LITTLE CIRCLE HERE, BUT THERE ARE SO MANY HANDS! YOUNG LADY WITH THE RED SCARF  RIGHT BACK THERE AGAINST THE WALL? HERE COMES THE MICROPHONE.  WELL, I STRONGLY SUP -- SUPPORT WHAT   THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE  IS NOW DOING, WHICH IS WORK TOWARD VOLUNTARILY LABELING AND  TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION FOR   CONSUMERS SO THAT ON BAR CODES   OR LABELS, PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY   KNOW WHAT THEY'RE BUYING.  THAT'S GOT TO BE THE FIRST   STEFMENT THE SECOND STEP I   SUPPORT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF   AGRICULTURE IS DOING IS  PREVENTING THE PROPONENTS OF   G.M.O.'S FROM STOPPING STATES FROM SETTING HIGHER STANDARDS  BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IN AN   AREA, AS YOU RIGHTLY SAY, WE   NEED MORE RESEARCH AND CONSUMERS NEED BETTER  INFORMATION BASED ON THE   RESEARCH WE CURRENTLY HAVE, THAT IT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE  MISTAKE FOR THE INDUSTRY TO BE ABLE TO USE THEIR INFLUENCE IN   CONGRESS TO STOP LOOKING INTO IT, FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT IT. I WANT MORE RESEARCH, TOO. I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT. THERE ARE SOME FORMS OF THIS THAT ARE LIFESAVERS. DROUGHT RESISTANT CROPS ARE OFTEN GENETICALLY MODIFIED. WE DON'T WANT TO DEPRIVE PEOPLE IN DROUGHT CONDITIONS FROM BEING ABLE TO GROW CROPS THAT THEY THEN CAN USE, UNLESS THERE IS EVIDENCE, RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT THEY CAN DO IT. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE NEED AN ONGOING SYSTEM OF DOING MUCH MORE TO CHECK OUT ALL THE CHEMICALS AND GENETIC CHANGES. IT'S NOT JUST GMO'S AMARIN ABOUT, WE HAVE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF CHEMICALS -- I'M WORRIED ABOUT, WE HAVE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF CHEMICALS THAT WE HAVE TO DETERMINE. I AM A HUGE BELIEVER IN SAFETY AND IN THE RIGHT TO KNOW. AND I THINK WE ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH ON EITHER OF THOSE COUNTS . RIGHT NOW, THAT'S WHERE I STAND ON IT. I AM NOT IN ANY WAY PRO, FORWARD, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. I THINK THAT'S NOT SMART. BUT I'M ALSO NOT ANTI-NO QUESTIONS ASKED. WE HAVE BEEN EATING THESE CROPS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS IN DIFFERENT FORMS, IT'S JUST MORE SOPHISTICATED NOW. I AM VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF MAKING SURE IT IS LABELED, MAKING SURE THAT NO STATE OR LOCAL COMMUNITY IS STOPPED FROM DOING WHAT IT THINKS IT'S RIGHT, AND MUCH MORE MONEY BY INDEPENDENT SOURCES IN LOOKING AT THE IMPACTS, THAT WE HAVE BETTER INFORMATION IN THE FIRST PLACE.   I HATE TO NOT LET SOMEBODY ELSE ASK A QUESTION. BACK HERE, I'VE HAD MY BACK TO THEM THE WHOLE TIME, HOW ABOUT THIS YOUNG LADY IN THE KEENE STATE DEBATE -- I'M BIG ON DEBATES, SO --    I WILL GIVE YOU MIC.  I HAVE TO SAY, I THINK KEENE STATE MAY BE THE FIRST COLLEGE IN THE COUNTRY TO HAVE A HOLOCAUST GENOCIDE STUDIES PROGRAM, RIGHT?   AND I JOIN IN THE APPLAUSE. I THINK THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND BRILLIANT TO HAVE A SPECIFIC CURRICULUM TO LOOK AT HOLOCAUST STUDIES AND GENOCIDE, BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO HAVE EDUCATED YOUNG PEOPLE AND OTHERS LIKE YOU WHO ARE EQUIPPED TO HELP US DEAL WITH A LOT OF THESE ISSUES. UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE LIVING WITH THEM. WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A BETTER RESPONSE. I WAS PRIVILEGED TO ANNOUNCE THE ATROCITIES PREVENTION BOARD WHEN IT WAS FIRST SET UP IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION --    AND I DID IT AT THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM IN WASHINGTON, IF ANY OF YOU HAVE IN THEIR. IT WAS THE MOST -- HAVE BEEN THERE. IT WAS THE MOST APPROPRIATE PLACE TO MAKE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT. I WILL CERTAINLY NOT ONLY CONTINUE IT, BUT LOOK FOR WAYS THAT ITS VISIBILITY CAN BECOME HIGHER SO THAT MORE PEOPLE KNOW THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS THIS BOARD, AND THAT WE WILL WORK TO FIND WAYS TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AROUND, AND RESPONSES -- AROUND COMMON RESPONSES TO POTENTIAL GENOCIDE, LEARNING FROM THE PAST. THERE ARE SO MANY THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ASPECTS TO THIS THAT DESERVE A LOT OF THOUGHT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE KNOW THAT OFTEN TIMES IN CONFLICTS -- ETHNIC, RELIGIOUS, TRIBAL, OTHER LEADERS OF GROUPS ACTUALLY SET THESE GENOCIDES IN MOTION. THEY USE THE MEDIA, WE SAW THAT IN BOSNIA, WHERE PEOPLE WHO HAD LIVED TOGETHER PEACEFULLY FOR A VERY LONG TIME WERE SET AGAINST EACH OTHER THROUGH A PROPAGANDA EFFORT ON THE MEDIA THAT TURNED NEIGHBOR AGAINST NEIGHBOR AND EVEN SPLIT FAMILIES, SO WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND QUICKLY IF SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS HAPPENING , WHAT ARE THE BEST WAYS TO COMBAT IT? WE SAW THE SAME THING AND RWANDA. WE HAVE SEEN THE SAME THING AND THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC BETWEEN CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS. WE HAVE TWO NOT ONLY CONDEMN THIS AND SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE HORRIBLE EFFECTS OF THE HOLOCAUST, OF GENOCIDE, AND OF ATROCITIES, BUT WE HAVE TO REALLY ANALYZE IT, AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO PROUD OF THE COURSE YOU ARE DOING. WHAT TRIGGERS IT? WHAT TURNS PEOPLE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER WHO HAVE BEEN MAYBE NOT LOVING EACH OTHER, BUT NOT KILLING EACH OTHER? ALL OF A SUDDEN, SOMETHING SETS THEM OFF. HOW DO WE TRY TO HAVE INTERVENTIONS THAT PREVENT THAT? A LOT OF CULTURES ARE ON A TRIP WIRE -- SOMETHING COULD SET THEM OFF. HOW DO WE HELP WE OTHER COUNTRIES -- HOW DO WE HELP OTHER COUNTRIES WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CULTURES UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO PREVENT IT FROM ESCALATING? I AM DELIGHTED AND I HOPE THAT THOSE WHO ARE IN THIS PROGRAM AND GRADUATE FROM IT WILL FIND WAYS IN OUR GOVERNMENT, WAYS IN OUR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION, AND NOT -- IN NONPROFITS, TO HELP UNDERSTAND WHAT WE CAN DO TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE.   THIS LADY RIGHT THERE. YEP, RIGHT THERE. HERE COMES A MICROPHONE. YOU. -- YEAH. A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH. HERE IT COMES.  I INTEND TO DO JUST THAT, AND MY PLAN IS MORE COMPREHENSIVE, MORE EFFECTIVE, AND IN FACT, TOUGHER. TAKE A LOOK AT PAUL KRUGMAN'S COLUMN TODAY. PAUL KRUGMAN, WHO I THINK IS PRETTY AMAZING PROGRESSIVE CREDENTIALS, BASICALLY SAID I HAD THE BETTER SIDE OF THIS ARGUMENT. WHY DID HE SAY THIS? BECAUSE I FULLY RESPECT MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE SAID, LET'S REINSTATE GLASS-STEAGALL. IF I THOUGHT THAT ALONE WOULD PREVENT A POTENTIAL NEXT CRISIS, I WOULD RAISE MY HAND AND JOIN, BUT THAT IS NOT MY ASSESSMENT. BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK, AS KRUGMAN SAID TODAY IN HIS COLUMN, SOME OF THE MAJOR ACTORS WHO CAUSED THE 2008 CRASH WERE NOT BIG BANKS AND WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN COVERED BY GLASS-STEAGALL. AIG, THE GIANT INSURANCE COMPANY, LEHMAN BROTHERS, THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY IT. WHAT I WANT TO DO WAS CRACKDOWN ON THE BANKS BY ASSESSING A RISKY AND FORCING THEM -- A RISK-FEE AND FORCING THEM TO HAVE TO COMPLY WITH. FRANK --. FRANK AND TOUGHER -- WITH DODD FRANK AND POTENTIAL REGULATIONS. I AM IN FAVOR OF BREAKING THEM UP IF THEY ARE A THREAT. BUT THE REAL THREAT IS THE WHAT IS CALLED THE SHADOW BANK WORLD, THE HEDGE FUNDS. GLASS-STEAGALL WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT IF IT WERE REINSTATED TOMORROW. I HAVE THE GREATEST RESPECT FOR MY COLLEAGUES AND FORMER COLLEAGUES WHO ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT, BUT I GO FURTHER. MY PROPOSAL, WHICH YOU CAN GO TO MY WEBSITE AND READ ABOUT, GOES MUCH FURTHER AND INCLUDES EVERYBODY THAT I THINK WOULD POSE A RISK TO THE ECONOMY, INCLUDING THE BIG BANKS, BUT GOING MUCH FURTHER THAN THAT. THAT'S WHY I HAVE TAKEN THE POSITION I HAVE. READ PAUL KRUGMAN TODAY TO UNDERSTAND WHY.   THIS YOUNG MAN I THINK HAS HAD HIS HAND UP FOR A LONG TIME, AND HE'S GOT A CHEERING SECTION BEHIND HIM. HE HAS BROUGHT HIS OWN CHEERLEADERS WHO ARE -- GO RIGHT AHEAD.  I THINK IF YOU SPEAK WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN OR ANY OF THE LARGE ADVOCACY GROUPS, THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY COUNT ON ME, AND THAT YOU CAN COUNT ON ME. I WAS THE FIRST AND ONLY FIRST LADY EVER TO MARJA GATE -- EVER TO MARCH IN THE PRIDE PARADE BACK IN THE 1980'S. I HAVE BEEN A VOCAL, VISIBLE ADVOCATE FOR EQUALITY AND AGAINST DISCRIMINATION. YES, MY VIEWS DID EVOLVE. I THINK MOST PEOPLE MY AGE WOULD SAY THE SAME THING. THERE MIGHT BE SOME EXCEPTIONS, BUT LARGELY BECAUSE OF MY STRONG OPPOSITION TO DISCRIMINATION OF ANY SORT AND MY PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH A LOTS OF PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS, I CERTAINLY INCLUDED THAT MARRIAGE -- CONCLUDED THAT MARRIAGE EQUALITY SHOULD BE THE LAW OF THE LAND, AND I WAS THRILLED WHEN THE SUPREME COURT MADE IT THE LAW OF THE LAND. AND I WILL --    I WILL ENFORCE MARRIAGE EQUALITY, BUT WE'VE GOT TO GO FURTHER THAN THAT. IN A LOT OF STATES NOW, BECAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL DECISION, YOU CAN GET MARRIED ON SATURDAY AND GET FIRED ON MONDAY. WE STILL PERMIT DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT AND IN PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS, SO WE HAVE TO FAST -- PAST THE EQUALITY -- PASS THE EQUALITY ACT CURRENTLY PENDING IN CONGRESS. THAT WILL BE MY HIGHEST PRIORITY. MARRIAGE IS NOT THE END OF THE DEBATE, IT IS THE PATH ALONG TRUE EQUALITY, AND YOU CAN COUNT ON ME TO FIGHT FOR  OK, UP THERE. YES, OK, HERE YOU GO. I LOVE YOUR RED.   FIRST OF ALL, THANKS FOR BEING A NURSE. I THINK PEOPLE KNOW OR SHOULD KNOW THAT NURSING CARE IS OFTEN THE SINGLE BIGGEST REASON PEOPLE EITHER GET WELL AND RECOVER OR NOT. THE NURSE IS AT THE CENTER OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN MANY WAYS.   A COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT THIS -- ONE, THE LAST TIME I LOOKED, MOST NURSING PROGRAMS WERE OVERSUBSCRIBED BY PEOPLE WANTING TO GET INTO THEM. THEY WERE -- THERE WERE FAR MORE APPLICANTS THAN THERE WERE PLACES FOR THEM. I THINK WE SHOULD BE EXPANDING OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS, OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS, SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY TRAINED MORE NURSES TO GET AHEAD OF WHAT IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THE RETIREMENT OF A LOT OF BABY BOOMER NURSES. THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH OF A SUPPLY IF WE DON'T START TRYING TO FILL THE PIPELINE NOW. THERE ARE SOME EXCELLENT PROGRAMS, BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO OPEN ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS. I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR PROGRAMS THAT HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF TURNING OUT EXCELLENT NURSES SO THEY CAN EXPAND, MORE FACULTY, MORE SLOTS , SAID THAT THEY CAN ADD TO THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAT GET INTO THE PROFESSION EARLY. I ALSO THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT NURSES BE GIVEN MORE AUTHORITY IN THE MEDICAL SETTINGS IN WHICH THEY WORK. WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF NURSES ARE BEING OVERWORKED, THEY ARE BEING ASKED TO SERVE VERY LONG SHIFTS, AND A LOT OF THEM NOW, BECAUSE THE NUMBERS HAVE SHRUNK AND A LOT OF SETTINGS, PARTICULARLY IN HOSPITAL AND NURSING HOME SETTINGS, NURSING HOMES OUR RESPONSE -- NURSES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE PATIENTS. THE NURSES I HAVE SPOKEN TO HAVE ALL SAID THIS IS UNSUSTAINABLE. IF YOU HAVE EVER SHATTERED A NURSE, WHICH I DID BACK IN 2007, IT IS EXHAUSTING. IN AND OUT OF PATIENYTS' RIMS -- I WAS IN A HOSPITAL, STOPPING TO DO THE CHECKS WITH DOCTORS, FILLING OUT THE FORMS -- BY THE END OF THE SHIFT, YOU ARE JUST DRAINED. IF YOU ARE TRY TO TAKE CARE OF TOO MANY PATIENTS, THE RESULT CAN BE UNFORTUNATE. I THINK ON BOTH ENDS -- MORE TRAINING, MORE EDUCATION, MORE SUPPORT FOR THIS PROGRAMS, AND TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT NURSES ON THE JOB HAVE THE SUPPORT AND AUTHORITY THAT THEY NEED. THAT'S HOW I WOULD TRY TO APPROACH THIS. ONE MORE QUESTION. THERE ARE A LOT OF HANDS UP HERE, MIKE, SO I WILL LET YOU PICK, WHOEVER IT IS SINCE YOU ARE THE ONE -- WHO DID YOU PICK? WITH YOUR EYES SHUT. OK. ALL RIGHT.  I CAN'T STAND THAT. I THINK THAT'S TERRIBLE. WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THAT. THE FAST THE -- FAFSA APPLICATION IS ABSURD.   WE HAVE HAD KIND OF A PERFECT STORM. THE APPLICATION TURNS PEOPLE OFF AND PENALIZES PEOPLE LIKE YOUR PARENTS, SO IT IS A LEASE-LOSE. -- LOSE-LOSE. THE PARENTS PLUS LOANS HAVE BEEN SO EXPENSIVE AND WAY BEYOND THE MEANS OF MOST FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE MAKING A PROFIT OFF OF STUDENT LOANS. THAT IS MY STRONG BELIEF.   WE'VE GOT TO FIX THE WHOLE SYSTEM. YOUR EXAMPLE IS UNFORTUNATELY ALL TOO COMMON. YOU ARE THE SAME PERSON. IF FAMILIES CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION, FINE, BUT IT HAS TO BE REASONABLE. IF STUDENTS CAN WORK, I WORKED, SO MAYBE I AM BIASED, 10 HOURS A WEEK TO GET DEBT FREE TUITION, WHICH IS MY GOAL. YOU NEVER HAVE TO BORROW A PENNY TO GET TUITION -- TO PAY TUITION FOR PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY, SO THAT WILL --    AND IT HAS GENERALLY BECOME SO WRONG. I HAD A YOUNG WOMAN IN NEVADA SAY TO ME COME OF THE HARDEST PART ABOUT GOING TO COLLEGE SHOULD NOT BE FIGURING OUT HOW TO PAY FOR IT. THE AMOUNT OF STRESS AND ENGLISH AND DISAPPOINTMENT FROM YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES IS JUST THE ODD ANYTHING IT SHOULD EVER BE. -- BEYOND ANYTHING IT SHOULD BE. THE OTHER PROBLEM I HAVE ENCOUNTERED FROM TALKING TO PEOPLE ALL THIS IS THAT A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO TRY TO START, THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS AND THEY DROP OUT, THEY ARE STUCK WITH THE LOANS AND HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT BECAUSE THEY NEVER GOT THEIR DEGREE. AND THE WORST OFFENDERS ARE SOME, NOT ALL -- SOME OF THE FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES THAT ARE PRETTY UNSCRUPULOUS AND HOW THEY TREAT STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS. AND ONE OF THE MOST EXPLOITED GROUPS ARE VETERANS, WHO UNDER THE NEW G.I. BILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE EDUCATION , AND A LOT OF THESE FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES TRY TO RECRUIT THE VETS , AND THEN THEY BASICALLY TAKE THE MONEY UNDER ONE OF THE LOOPHOLES IN THE LAW, AND DON'T PRODUCE RESULTS FOR OUR VETS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES HERE THAT I AM GOING TO BE CONFRONTING. THE DEBT FREE TUITION WOULD BE A BIG HELP TO YOU. THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF MY PRIMARY GOALS -- TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE AND GET THE DEBT LOAD DOWN AND HOPEFULLY ELIMINATED IN A MORE REASONABLE WAY THAN WHAT YOU ARE FACING. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.   THANK YOU ALL.      ","Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton in Keene, New Hampshire"

DID WE HAVE A GOOD DEBATE LAST NIGHT! AND YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE REASONS IT WAS GOOD IS BECAUSE WE WERE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT WHAT A PRESIDENT SHOULD BE DOING TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE SUPPORT YOU NEED TO MAKE THE MOST OUT OF YOUR LIVES, AND I AM THRILLED THAT PEOPLE FINALLY GOT A CHANCE TO COMPARE THE DEMOCRATS TO THE REPUBLICANS AND I THINK WE CAME OUT OF THAT PRETTY WELL. I AM THRILLED TO SEE ALL OF YOU HERE IN THIS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL SPOT. IT IS SUCH A GREAT PLEASURE TO LOOK OUT AND SEE SO MANY OF YOU WHO ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT YOU CAUCUS IN THE NEVADA CAUCUSES AND THEN WE WILL WIN NEVADA FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO KEEP A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE! NOW, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO JUST KIND OF GET RID OF SOME OF THE MYTHS THAT YOU HEAR FROM THE OTHER SIDE. STARTING WITH A FACT THAT OUR ECONOMY IN OUR COUNTRY DOES BETTER WHEN WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT JUST TO PUT THOSE FACTS IN YOUR HEAD SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING WITH SOME OF YOUR OPEN-MINDED INDEPENDENT FRIENDS OR YOU'RE TALKING TO REPUBLICANS, YOU CAN TELL THEM THAT THIS IS NOT JUST ME SAYING IT. THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE. WHEN WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE, UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOWER, INCOME IS HIGHER, AND EVEN THE STOCK MARKET IS HIGHER, BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE, YOU ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A RECESSION. I KNOW THAT THE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT SAY THEY WANT TO GO BACK AND DO WHAT DIDN'T WORK BEFORE. I THINK THEY WANT US ALL TO FORGET ABOUT THE GREAT RECESSION WHICH HIT THIS STATE REALLY HARD. YOU KNOW, IN 2008, WE WERE LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH. WE ENDED UP LOSING NINE MILLION JOBS. NINE MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY LOST THEIR JOBS. FIVE MILLION LOST THEIR HOMES. AFTER THAT ELECTION, JUST ABOUT A WEEK AFTER IT, I GOT A CALL FROM THEN PRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA AND HE ASKED ME TO COME SEE HIM IN CHICAGO AND I KNOW WHY. TURNS OUT HE WANTED ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE WHICH I WAS VERY HONORED TO BE ASKED TO DO. BUT WHEN I GOT THERE, HE SAID, WE COULD FALL INTO A GREAT DEPRESSION. AND WE COULD HAVE. I DO NOT THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA GETS THE CREDIT HE DESERVES FOR SAVING OUR ECONOMY FROM WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN AN EVEN WORSE CRISIS, SAVING THE AUTO INDUSTRY, CRACKING DOWN ON WALL STREET ABUSES WHICH THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN IGNORING, AND PASSING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH NOW PROVIDES HEALTH INSURANCE TO 18 MILLION AMERICANS! SO YOU WOULD THINK WITH A RECORD LIKE THAT, THE REPUBLICANS MIGHT HAVE CHANGED THEIR APPROACH, BUT NOT A BIT. IN FACT, YOU HEAR ONLY THE SAME THINGS THAT ENDED UP IN THE DITCH IN THE FIRST PLACE. CUT TAXES ON THE WEALTHY, GET OUT OF THE WAY OF CORPORATIONS. THAT'S BASICALLY ALL THEY SAY ABOUT THE ECONOMY. THAT IS NOT GOING TO WORK, FOLKS. I HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH. I'M PRETTY PROUD OF THE ECONOMIC RECORD MY HUSBAND HAD AT THE END OF EIGHT YEARS OF HIS PRESIDENCY WE HAD 23 MILLION NEW JOBS. AND LISTEN TO THIS, INCOMES WENT UP FOR EVERYBODY. NOT JUST FOR THOSE AT THE TOP. PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE, WORKING FOLKS, POOR PEOPLE -- EVERYBODY BENEFITED, BECAUSE WE HAD AN ECONOMY THAT WAS WORKING FOR EVERYBODY AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT ALL CHANGED WHEN THE REPUBLICANS CAME BACK INTO THE WHITE HOUSE AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. AND SO PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD TO DIG US OUT OF THE DITCH. WE'RE OUT, WE'RE STANDING BUT WE'RE NOT YET RUNNING. I WANT TO DO WHAT WILL WORK TO PUT MORE PEOPLE TO WORK AND TO RAISE WAGES AGAIN BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BUDGED. THERE IS SOMETHING REALLY WRONG WHEN C.E.O. PAY IS 300 TIMES WHAT THE TYPICAL WORKER MAKES. NOW, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY BELIEVES THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET WAGES RISING AGAIN UNLESS WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT WITH A PRESIDENT WHO ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT MAKING SURE HARD-WORKING PEOPLE SEE THE FRUITS OF YOUR LABOR. SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. WE'RE GOING TO START BY CREATING MORE JOBS, BY ACTUALLY INVESTING IN PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK TO BUILD, MAINTAIN OUR ROADS, OUR BRIDGES, OUR AIRPORTS. WE'RE GOING TO REPAIR OUR SEWER LINES, OUR WATER LINE, OUR GAS LINES. WE'RE GOING TO EXPAND BROAD BAND SO THAT WE HAVE THE CHEAPEST, FASTEST BROADBAND IN THE WORLD INSTEAD OF RANKING BEHIND SO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES. WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN SCIENCE AND RESEARCH WHICH WILL RESULT IN A LOT OF NEW BUSINESSES. I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW, THE REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON ANYTHING THAT ACTUALLY HELPS PEOPLE AND THEY DON'T WANT TO INVEST IN THE FUTURE. WELL, WE INVESTED $3.8 BILLION IN SOMETHING CALLED THE HUMAN GENOME PROJECT 20 YEARS AGO. I REMEMBER BEING IN THE WHITE HOUSE THE DAY THAT MY HUSBAND ANNOUNCED IT HAD BEEN COMPLETED. NOW, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT MEANS WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CURE DISEASES AND MAYBE STOP CONDITIONS ONCE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT CAUSES THEM. BUT HERE'S THE ECONOMIC POINT I WANT TO MAKE. OUT OF THAT $3.8 BILLION INVESTMENT OF YOUR TAX MONEY AND MINE, NEARLY A TRILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN GENERATED -- NEW DISCOVERIES, NEW BUSINESSES, NEW KINDS OF JOBS FOR THE FUTURE. WE'RE BETTER AT THIS THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD. WE NEED TO BE MAKING THOSE SMART INVESTMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE US RICHER AND WE'VE GOT TO GET THE CONGRESS TO GET OUT OF THE WAY AND BEGIN TO BUILD A BETTER ECONOMIC FUTURE AGAIN! I TELL YOU ANOTHER WAY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE IN THE ECONOMY, CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS AND BUSINESSES AND THAT IS WE TAKE CLIMATE CHANGE SERIOUSLY, DON'T WE? WE'RE NOT OVER WITH THOSE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHO EVERY TIME YOU ASK THEM, WELL, WHAT ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE? THEY SAY SOMETHING LIKE, WELL, I DON'T KNOW, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST. WELL, THERE'S A VERY EASY WAY TO SOLVE THAT. TALK TO A SCIENTIST, WHY DON'T YOU? THERE ARE SOME GOOD ONES HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY. THEY COULD TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO AFFECT THE LIVES OF EVERYONE OF US ALIVE BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. BUT BECAUSE IF WE DO THIS RIGHT, WE CAN CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS AND BUSINESSES. YOU KNOW, EVERY YEAR, SENATOR HARRY REID HAS A BIG CONFERENCE ABOUT CLEAN ENERGY HERE IN NEVADA. I'VE SPOKEN AT IT. MY HUSBAND'S SPOKEN AT IT. WHY DOES HE DO THAT? BECAUSE HE WANTS PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. YOU KNOW, IT IS POSSIBLE, IF WE INVEST IN WIND AND SOLAR, ADVANCED BIOFUELS, GEOTHERMAL, YOU NAME IT, WE COULD NOT ONLY BEGIN TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT WE COULD BEGIN TO BUILD OUR ECONOMY IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT WAY. YOU HERE IN NEVADA ARE DOING JUST THAT, YOU'VE GOT THAT BIG BATTERY FACTORY GOING IN. YOU'VE BEEN INVESTING IN MORE SOLAR. IN THE HOTEL I STAYED IN BEFORE THE DEBATE, I WAS LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AND I SAW THOSE SOLAR PANELS DRIVING AROUND TODAY, GOING TO DIFFERENT EVENTS, I SAW A LOT OF PLACES WITH SOLAR PANELS. WELL, I'M SETTING SOME BIG GOALS FOR MY PRESIDENCY. BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM, I WANT US TO HAVE EMPLOYED A HALF A BILLION MORE SOLAR PANELS TO BE INSTALLED ACROSS AMERICA AND BY THE END OF MY SECOND, I WANT US TO GENERATE ENOUGH CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME IN AMERICA. THAT IS THE KIND OF ECONOMIC PROGRAM THAT WILL PUT PEOPLE TO WORK. THE WHEN SOMEBODY TELLS YOU THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT JOBS GOING OVERSEAS, WELL, IF WE DO INFRASTRUCTURE AT HOME, AND WE DO CLEAN ENERGY AT HOME, THOSE JOBS HAVE TO BE DONE RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. NOW, I ALSO BELIEVE WE GOT TO CHANGE THE TAX SYSTEM. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF CORPORATIONS GETTING BIG TAX BREAKS AND LOOPHOLES AND ALL THE REST OF IT TO SHIP JOBS OUT OF AMERICA. WE NEED TO TAKE AWAY THE TAX BREAKS FROM THOSE CORPORATIONS AND USE THAT MONEY TO REBUILD OUR ECONOMY RIGHT HERE AT HOME. WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO RAISE WAGES STARTING BY RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE WHICH HAS BEEN TOO LOW FOR TOO LONG. I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE WHO WORK FOR THE MINIMUM WAGE HERE. RIGHT? I KNOW THAT. THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE, $7.25 AN HOUR, IS A DISGRACE. NOBODY WHO WORKS FULL-TIME SHOULD BE LEFT IN POVERTY AT THE END OF THEIR WORKING WEEK. SO WE ARE GOING TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL IT HAS EVER BEEN, BACK TO WHERE IT WAS IN 1968, BECAUSE SINCE THEN, WE HAVE BEEN ON A DOWNWARD SLOPE. AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO DO MORE TO INVEST IN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS, IN JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS. I WAS AT THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF PAINTERS AND ALLIED TRADES TODAY LOOKING AT HOW THEY TRAIN THEIR YOUNG APPRENTICES. I WAS SO IMPRESSED. I KNOW WE CAN TRAIN TENS OF THOUSANDS, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO DO THE JOBS THAT CLEAN ENERGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDING REQUIRE. NOW, I'LL TELL YOU, THERE'S ONE OTHER THING THAT WILL RAISE WAGES ACROSS THE BOARD IN AMERICA AND THAT IS TO MAKE SURE WOMEN GET EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, IT'S A LITTLE EMBARRASSING TO BE TALKING ABOUT DOING THIS IN 2015. BUT IT HASN'T BEEN DONE YET. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOSING MONEY BECAUSE OF IT. I MET A YOUNG MAN LAST WEEK IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WHO CAME UP TO ME AND HE SAID, I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY I'M FOR YOU. I SAID, THANK YOU, WHY? HE SAID, I'LL TELL YOU. MY FIRST JOB, HE WAS 17 YEARS OLD, HE TOLD ME, HE GOT HIRED TO BE A CASHIER IN A STORE NEAR WHERE HE LIVED. HE KIND OF GOT THE JOB BECAUSE HIS MOM HAD BEEN WORKING THERE FOR FOUR YEARS AND SHE WAS DOING THE SAME JOB AS A CASHIER. HE WAS REALLY PROUD. YOU KNOW, FIRST REAL JOB, YOU GO TO WORK, AND HE CAME BACK, GOT HIS FIRST PAYCHECK, SHOWED HIS MOM. AND SHE NOTICED SOMETHING. HER SON WAS MAKING A DOLLAR MORE AN HOUR AFTER ONE WEEK THAN SHE WAS MAKING AFTER FOUR YEARS. NOW, I TELL YOU THAT STORY BECAUSE THIS YOUNG MAN HAD NO REASON TO MAKE IT UP. HE WANTED TO TELL ME WHY HE WAS FOR ME. HE SAID, I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEFORE. HE SAID, IT'S WRONG. MY MOM WORKS REALLY HARD. SHE WAS RAISING ME AND SHE SHOULD BE PAID AT THE SAME LEVEL AS ANY MAN, INCLUDING HER 17-YEAR-OLD SON. EQUAL PAY IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST A WOMAN'S ISSUE. IT'S A FAMILY ISSUE. IT'S AN ECONOMIC ISSUE. THERE WILL BE MORE MONEY IN THE ECONOMY WHEN WOMEN ARE PAID FAIRLY FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AND WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT HOW HARD IT IS TO BALANCE FAMILY AND WORK. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF YOUNG PARENTS STRUGGLE WITH THAT, DON'T YOU? I THINK WE SHOULD JOIN THE REST OF THE ADVANCED WORLD AND HAVE PAID LEAVE SO THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A NEW BABY, WHEN YOU HAVE A SICK RELATIVE, YOU DON'T LOSE YOUR JOB BUT YOU ALSO DON'T LOSE YOUR PAY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, YOU'RE ABLE TO FULFILL YOUR FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES. SOME PEOPLE SAY, WELL, WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT, BUT CALIFORNIA'S BEEN DOING THIS. CONNECTICUT JUST DID PAID SICK DAYS. OTHER STATES ARE DOING IT. AND IT HASN'T AFFECTED THE WAY THAT THE REPUBLICANS SAY IT WILL FOR EMPLOYMENT. SO WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A HARD LOOK ABOUT WHAT ARE FAMILIES LIKE TODAY, NOT WHAT THEY WERE LIKE 50 YEARS, WHAT ARE THEY LIKE TODAY. AND HOW DO WE HELP THEM DO THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB WHICH IS TAKING CARE OF EACH OTHER WHILE THEY ALSO DO THEIR JOB MAKING A LIVING. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE TAX SYSTEM BE CHANGED SO THAT THE WEALTHY PAY MORE THAN THEY'RE PAYING RIGHT NOW. I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT THAT A MILLIONAIRE CAN PAY A LOWER TAX RATE THAN A TEACHER. I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT. I AGREE WITH WARREN BUFFETT. WARREN BUFFETT SAID, EVERY MILLIONAIRE SHOULD HAVE TO PAY AT LEAST 30%, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT PAYING 15, AND A LOT OF COMPANIES AREN'T PAYING ANYTHING. SO PART OF THE JOB THAT I WILL TAKE ON AS YOUR PRESIDENT IS TO GET THE WEALTHY TO PAY MORE AND GIVE THE MIDDLE CLASS A TAX CUT. GIVE THE MIDDLE CLASS THAT IS WORKING HARD AND DOING THE BEST YOU CAN IN THE FACE OF THE PRESSURES YOU FACE, MORE OF A CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET. SINCE YOUR PAY HASN'T GONE UP BUT THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING ELSE HAS, I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO. THE REPUBLICANS SEEM TOTHE REPUBLICANS SEEM TO FORGET THAT WHAT MAKES OUR ECONOMY GREAT AND THE MIDDLE CLASS STRONG AS THE MIDDLE CLASS. THE MIDDLE CLASS TO BUILD THIS COUNTRY. THE MIDDLE CLASS DOES MOST OF THE WORK. IT'S THE MIDDLE CLASS THAT HAS TO GET UP EVERY DAY AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR JOB. AND I THINK IT'S TIME WE START REBUILDING THE MIDDLE CLASS, GIVING YOU THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO MAKE THE MOST OUT OF YOUR OWN LIVES, AT HOME AND AT WORK. AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT ELSE WOULD REALLY HELP US IN THE ECONOMY, AND THAT IS TO GET COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM FINALLY TAKEN CARE OF.   I REALLY DON'T LIKE WITH REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING ABOUT IMMIGRANTS. WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS. WE WERE BUILT BY IMMIGRANTS. EVERY ONE OF US, GRANDPARENTS, GREAT-GRANDPARENTS, WE HAVE SOMEBODY WHO CAME TO THIS COUNTRY. AND AREN'T WE GLAD THEY DID. AND AREN'T WE RELIEVED THAT WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THEIR HARD WORK. MY GRANDFATHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AS JUST A LITTLE BOY. HE WAS A FACTORY WORKER. HE WORKED REALLY HARD. HE DID NOT ASK FOR MUCH. HE MADE A GOOD LIVING, BY THOSE STANDARDS IN THOSE DAYS, BY HIS HARD WORK, BUT HE WANTED HIS KIDS TO HAVE A BETTER CHANCE. AND ALL THREE OF HIS SONS WENT TO COLLEGE. AND MY DAD BECAME A MEMBER OF THE MILITARY IN WORLD WAR II. AND NOW I'M HERE ASKING YOU TO VOTE FOR ME FOR PRESIDENT. THAT IS THREE GENERATIONS, FROM MY GRANDFATHER TO MY FATHER TO ME. AND IF WE HAVE TIME TONIGHT, WE COULD GO THROUGH THIS CROWD AND HAVE A THOUSAND STORIES LIKE THAT. IMMIGRATION IS WHO WE ARE. LOOK AROUND US. AND I THINK THE REPUBLICANS ARE DOING GREAT DAMAGE TO OUR NATION BY THEIR INSULTS AND ATTACKS ON IMMIGRANTS. SO AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL CERTAINLY WORK HARD FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM , BUT I WILL ALSO DEFEND THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA ISSUED ON BEHALF OF DREAMERS. AND I KNOW -- I KNOW WE HAVE SOME DREAMERS HERE TONIGHT.   BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO WORK HARD IN AMERICA AND I WANT YOU TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO BUILDING OUR ECONOMY. AND THERE ARE SO MANY EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT, THOUGH, THAT WE GIVE THE BEST POSSIBLE EDUCATION TO EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY, SO THAT YOU ARE PREPARED TO BE COMPETITIVE. I WILL DO WHAT I CAN, WORKING WITH THE TEACHERS OF AMERICA AND RESPECTING THE TEACHERS OF AMERICA TO DO WHAT WILL WORK IN ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION, TO GIVE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE THE BEST POSSIBLE START IN LIFE. BUT I WILL TO YOU THIS -- IF WE DO NOT DO SOMETHING WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION, IF WE DON'T HELP KIDS COME ESPECIALLY KIDS WHO FIRST LINK WHICH -- WHOSE FIRST LINK WHICH MAY NOT BE LIKE WHICH, IF WE DO NOT GET YOU PREPARED FOR SCHOOL, YOU WILL NOT GO AS FAR AS YOU COULD. SO THAT IS WHY I BELIEVE THOSE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF LIFE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. THE FAMILIES ARE THE FIRST SCHOOL, THE PARENTS ARE THE FIRST TEACHERS, AND WE NEED TO DO MORE TO HELP YOU PREPARE YOUR CHILDREN TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL. SO I WANT TO HAVE UNIVERSAL PREKINDERGARTEN THAT WILL GIVE EVERY CHILD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PREPARED. AND THEN ON THE OTHER END, I WANT TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE SO IF YOU DO DECIDE TO GO TO COLLEGE, YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO AND GRADUATE.   HOW MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS CROWD HAVE STUDENT LOANS? HOW MANY HAVE EVER HAD STUDENT LOANS? I HAD STUDENT LOANS. I HAD TO PAY THEM BACK. MY HUSBAND HAD THEM COME HE PAY THEM BACK. BUT IT IS NOT LIKE IT IS TODAY, WHERE IT COST SO MUCH AND THE INTEREST RATES ARE SO HIGH. WE HAVE 40 MILLION AMERICANS WITH STUDENT LOANS. I WANT YOU TO BE A BUT TO REFINANCE THOSE LOANS TO A LOWER INTEREST RATE -- I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO REFINANCE THOSE LOANS TO A LOWER INTEREST RATE AND SAVE THOUSANDS. IF A CORPORATION CAN REFINANCE ITS DEBT, A YOUNG PERSON OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO REFINANCE THEIR DEBT. AND WE NEED TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE. I WANT TO OFFER FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND --   DEBT FREE TUITION AT ANY PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. SO THAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO GO. BECAUSE HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS -- IF YOU ARE WELL OFF, EVEN IF YOUR GRADES WERE NOT THAT GREAT, YOU WILL HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GO TO COLLEGE AND GRADUATE. BUT IF YOU ARE MIDDLE-CLASS OR WORKING OR POOR, BUT JUST AS AMBITIOUS, JUST AS WILLING TO DO WHAT IT TAKES, YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO START OR YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO FINISH. I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN SO THAT ANY YOUNG PERSON IN AMERICA CAN GET THE JOB TRAINING YOU WANT, AND APPRENTICESHIP IF YOU WANT, COMMUNITY COLLEGE IF YOU WANT IT, FOR YOUR COLLEGE IF YOU WANT IT AT A PRICE THAT YOU CAN PAY, AND THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PAY AT BACK AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE INCOME THAT YOU ARE. -- THAT YOU EARN. AND IF YOU DO PUBLIC SERVICE WORK LIKE TEACHING OR POLICING OR FIREFIGHTING, YOU WILL PAY A LOWER RATE TO BE ABOUT TO GO AND GET YOUR EDUCATION.  I ALSO WANT TO SAY THE REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED 54 TIMES TO REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 54 TIMES. IF THEY GET A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, THEY WILL SUCCEED. THAT IS UP TO YOU. I WILL DO MY PART, BUT I'M GOING TO NEED HN EVERYONE OF YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS -- I'M GOING TO NEED EACH AND EVERYONE ONE OF YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS.   I WILL DEFEND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 18 MILLION PEOPLE ARE NOW GETTING THEIR HEALTH CARE THROUGH IT. BUT I DO WANT TO MIX SOME CHANGES THAT WILL IMPROVE IT. I WANT TO CUT COSTS OF YOUR OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES. I WANT TO CUT THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT ARE SKYROCKETING BEYOND THE AFFORDABILITY OF AMERICANS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS GET TAKEN CARE OF, JUST LIKE PEOPLE WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU ARE A CAREGIVER FOR SOMEBODY WITH ALZHEIMER'S OR AUTISM OR ANY OTHER SITUATION LIKE THE PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS OR FAMILY CAREGIVER THAT YOU HAVE SOME HELP. WE HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF THEIR LOVED ONES, AND WE HAVE MILLIONS MORE WHO ARE WORKING BARELY FOR THE MINIMUM WAGE TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE. WE CANNOT DO THAT. WE HAVE TO BE SMART ABOUT HOW WE PLAN FOR CAREGIVING AS WE ALL FACE THE ONSLAUGHT OF ALL TIMERS -- ALZHEIMER'S. OR WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE WITH AUTISM GET OLDER. WE HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THAT. AND THEY'RE SOMETHING ELSE WE NEED TO TREAT RIGHT NOW, AND THAT HIS ADDICTION. 23 MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS. ALCOHOL OR DRUGS. AND THEY CANNOT GET HELP EVEN IF THEY WANT IT. ONLY ONE IN 10 CAN GET IT. WE HAVE TO HAVE MORE HELP AND MORE SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE DEALING WITH THE ADDICTED. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THEY ARE ENDING UP IN JAIL OR ENDING UP ON THE STREETS, AND THAT IS NOT RIGHT, AND WE END UP SPENDING MORE MONEY THAN WE WOULD. I WILL TELL YOU, I SPEND A LOT OF TIMES AND I WOULD THESE DAYS. IOWA HAS GOOD DRUG SUPPORT. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING GOOD WORK HELPING FOLKS. BUT THEY RAN OUT OF MONEY, SO THEY ARE SETTING AT THEM. LET ME TELL YOU THIS LITTLE FACT -- IT COSTS $3500 FOR SOMEBODY TO GO THROUGH DRUG COURT, TO TRY TO GET THEM OFF DRUGS, GET TREATMENT. IF THEY GO TO PRISON, IT COSTS $35,000. ECONOMICALLY, IT MAKES NO SENSE. IF WE TREAT PEOPLE, IT WILL SAVE US MONEY AND SAVE LIVES AND HELP THEM GET BETTER AND OVERCOME THEIR PROBLEMS.   NOW, THERE IS A LOT THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR AGAINST THE REPUBLICANS, BECAUSE THEY JUST HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO SO MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR AMERICA TODAY. AND I WILL. I WILL FIGHT TO DEFEND A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE, AND I WILL FIGHT --   I WILL FIGHT AGAINST EFFORTS TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD, WHICH HAS PROVIDED HEALTH CARE TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS.   I WILL FIGHT TO ENFORCE MARRIAGE EQUALITY, AND THEN FIGHT AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBT HUM COMMUNITY. I WILL FIGHT TO MAKE SURE WHEN YOU TURN 18 YOU CAN VOTE AND YOU WILL NOT BE STOPPED BY LAWS TRYING TO RESTRICT THE VOTE AND AMERICA. AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO OVERTURN A DECISION CALLED CITIZENS UNITED, WHICH HAS CORRUPTED OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM. I WILL ALSO FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR VETERANS GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED AND DESERVE, NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE.   I WILL FIGHT TO MAKE SURE BLACK LIVES MATTER BY REFORMING OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.   AND I WILL TRY TO FIND WAYS SO THAT WE AS AMERICANS CAN START LISTENING TO EACH OTHER AGAIN. TALKING WITH EACH OTHER. I'M TIRED OF THE YELLING AND THE INSULTS AND THE ATTACKS AND THE SNIDE REMARKS ABOUT PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THEIR PARENTAGE OR RELIGION OR WHO THEY LOVE OR WHAT THEY DO. I'M TIRED OF IT. I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHO WE ARE. WE CAN HAVE POLITICAL DIFFERENCES. WE DO HAVE POLITICAL DIFFERENCES. BUT WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE TREATING REACH OTHER -- TREATING EACH OTHER WITH RESPECT. AND THAT CANNOT HAPPEN IF YOU ARE BEING YELLED AT. OR IF YOU ARE BEING INSULTED. I FEEL THAT WE ARE MISSING SOMETHING RIGHT NOW IN OUR POLITICS. WE ARE NOT BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO TRY TO FIND COMMON GROUND THE WAY THAT WE NEED TO. BECAUSE THERE IS A BIG GROUP THAT DON'T WANT TO TRY. THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ON THIS EARTH HAS ALL THE ANSWERS. I THINK WE SHOULD BE LISTENING AND LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS FIRST LADY, WE WORKED REALLY HARD TO GET HEALTH CARE AND WE FAILED. AND I SAID, OK, WE FAILED. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW? I GOT TO WORK TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE WOULD INSURE CHILDREN. I WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. AND WE ENDED UP STARTING THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM, WHICH TAKES CARE AND PROVIDES HEALTH CARE TO 8 MILLION CHILDREN IN AMERICA TODAY.   AND WHEN I WENT TO THE SENATE, I LEARNED THAT OUR NATIONAL GUARD MEN AND WOMEN WERE NOT GETTING HEALTH CARE EXCEPT WHEN THEY WERE DEPLOYED. I DID NOT THINK THAT WAS RIGHT. I TEAMED UP WITH THE REPUBLICAN SENATOR, LINDSEY GRAHAM, WHO WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ON THE OTHER SIDE. NO, LISTEN, WE WORK TOGETHER. THAT'S MY POINT. WE MAY NOT WORK ON ANYTHING ELSE BUT THAT ONE ISSUE, BUT IT MADE A DIFFERENCE. WE PASSED A BILL TO GIVE HEALTH CARE TO OUR NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND NATIONAL GUARD'S WOMEN SO THEY COULD BE HEALTHY AND THEIR FAMILIES COULD BE  AND WHEN I WAS SECRETARY, I WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS. WE NEGOTIATE A DEAL TO CUT THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA. AND I WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS TO PASS IT. WE HAD TO GET 67 VOTES. IT WAS AN IMPORTANT TREATY. BUT WE TALKED TO EACH OTHER. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TRIED SO HARD TO FIND COMMON GROUND. AND HE HAS REACHED OUT AND HE HAS INVITED PEOPLE, AND THEY JUST GET FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY, AND THEIR ATTITUDE BASICALLY HAS BECOME -- THEY DON'T EVEN LIKE THE RUN SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. -- THEY DON'T EVEN LIKE THE RUN SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. BECAUSE IN THE VIEW OF SOME HE IS NOT 100 PERCENT WITH THEM. I'M NOT 100% WITH ANYBODY. MY HUSBAND UNDERSTANDS THAT.   BUT OUR COUNTRY WAS BUILT ON PEOPLE TALKING AND THEN FINDING COMMON AREAS OF AGREEMENT. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO DOING AGAIN. I WILL GO ANYWHERE, ANYTIME TO TALK TO ANYBODY ABOUT FINDING COMMON GROUND, BUT I WILL ALSO STAND MY GROUND. BECAUSE I THINK MY JOB AS YOUR PRESIDENT WILL BE TO RAISE INCOME FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS, TO PUT IN PLACE THE LADDERS OF OPPORTUNITY SO EVERY CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY HAS A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL, AND OF COURSE I'M FEELING THAT PARTICULARLY THEY STRONGLY THESE DAYS BECAUSE I'M A GRANDDAUGHTER WHO IS ONE-YEAR-OLD. AND BILL AND I ARE TYPICAL GRANDPARENTS. DON'T GET US STARTED.   WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME JUST LOOKING AT HER. WHICH IS, FOR US, INCREDIBLY WONDERFUL. AND WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE SHE HAS WHATEVER OPPORTUNITIES SHE CAN HAVE IN HER LIFE. I THINK EVERY FAMILY TRIES TO DO THAT. FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR GRANDCHILDREN. WE HAVE A LOT MORE BLESSINGS. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT WE DO WHAT WE CAN FOR CHARLOTTE, BECAUSE IT MATTERS WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY SHE BECOMES AN ADULT IN AND WHAT KIND OF WORLD WILL BE WAITING OUT THERE FOR HER. WILL IT HE SAFE, WILL IT BE PROSPEROUS, WITH A BE PEACEFUL? WILL AMERICA STILL BE THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY, WHERE IMMIGRANTS ARE WELCOME AND HARD WORK IS REWARDED AND WHERE PEOPLE CAN GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD? IS THAT GOING TO BE THERE? I TELL YOU, I'M BETTING IT WILL, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BY JUST BETTING. WE HAVE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. I TOLD YOU MY GRANDFATHER WAS A FACTORY WORKER. AND MY GRANDDAUGHTER IS THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FORMER PRESIDENT. SO FOR ME, IT'S NOT ENOUGH THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FORMER PRESIDENT GETS AHEAD. I WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF FACTORY WORKERS AND GRANDSONS OF TRUCK DRIVERS AND THE GRANDCHILDREN OF TEACHERS AND FAST FOOD WORKERS AND CHILDCARE WORKERS AND EVERYBODY WHO WORKS HARD IN THIS COUNTRY HAS THE SAME CHANCE TO GET AHEAD AND MAKE THE MOST OUT OF THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL! THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT! THAT'S WHY I NEED YOUR HELP! JOIN US, SAID CAUCUS IN NEVADA, AND LET'S GO WIN NOVEMBER 2016! THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH!

I'M DELIGHTED AND HONORED TO BE HERE. LUDA LISANDRO HAS BEEN A FRIEND OF MINE FOR A LONG TIME, AND A SENATOR REPRESENTING THIS DISTRICT. I THANK HIM VERY MUCH FOR HIS SUPPORT AND HIS FRIENDSHIP. I WANT TO THANK ERIN AND ELEANOR FOR BEING WITH US. ERIN'S STORY IS UNFORTUNATELY WAY TOO COMMON. WE ARE HERE ON THE CAMPUS OF A WONDERFUL COMMUNITY COLLEGE, VERY MUCH LIKE THE ONE IN OREGON. WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE GOING TO SCHOOL, AND SOME NOT SO YOUNG. THE VICTIMS I READ ARE BETWEEN 18 YEARS OLD AND 67 YEARS OLD. PEOPLE ATTENDING CLASSES AND IMPROVING THEIR SKILLS, TEACHING, LEARNING, THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE. WHICH WAS SO ENDED, SENSELESSLY, TRAGICALLY. ON THAT VERY SAME DAY THAT THOSE PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN OREGON, A FIVE-MONTH-OLD BABY STRAPPED INTO HER CAR SEAT IN THE BACK OF A CAR WAS KILLED BY A STRAY BULLET IN CLEVELAND. THE THIRD BABY IN JUST A FEW MONTHS TO BE MURDERED IN CLEVELAND. BETWEEN 88 AND 92 PEOPLE A DAY ARE KILLED BY GUNS IN AMERICA. THE LAST FIGURES WE HAVE FOR A WHOLE YEAR IS MORE THAN 33,000. IT IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN, THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE FOR YOUNG HISPANIC MEN, THE FOURTH LEADING CAUSE FOR YOUNG WHITE MEN. THIS EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE KNOWS NO BOUNDARIES. IT KNOWS NO LIMITS. AND WHEN THIS HAPPENS, PEOPLE ARE QUICK TO SAY THAT THEY OFFER THEIR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS. THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE BEFORE WE ACTUALLY ACT? BEFORE WE COME TOGETHER AS A NATION.   YOU KNOW, ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, MR. TRUMP WAS ASKED ABOUT IT AND SAID SOMETHING LIKE YOU KNOW, THINGS LIKE THAT HAPPEN IN THE WORLD. GOVERNOR BUSH SAID YEAH, STUFF HAPPENS. NO. THAT IS AN ADMISSION OF DEFEAT AND SURRENDER. TO A PROBLEM THAT IS KILLING 33,000 AMERICANS. IT IS TIME FOR US TO SAY WAIT A MINUTE, WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. OUR COUNTRY IS BETTER THAN THIS. AND THERE ARE STEPS WE CAN TAKE --   THAT IMPROVE GUN SAFETY AND FURTHER THE PREVENTION OF VIOLENCE BY GUNS. AND TODAY, IM -- I AM PROPOSING WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE COMMON SENSE APPROACHES. A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SUPPORT UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. IN FACT, A MAJORITY OF GUN OWNERS SUPPORT UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. WE HAD A BIPARTISAN BILL THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE SENATE. BUT WE NEED TO GO BACK AND, WITH ALL OF OUR HEARTS, WORKING NOT JUST IN WASHINGTON, BUT FROM A GRASSROOTS UP, DEMAND THAT WE HAVE UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. AND WE HAVE TO ALSO --   WE HAVE TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES. YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT WHAT IS CALLED THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE, AND WE'VE GOT WHAT'S NOW BEING CALLED THE CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE. WHEN THE BRADY BILL WAS PASSED, WHICH WASN'T EASY, AS YOU RECALL, BUT IT DID PASS. EXCEPTIONS WERE MADE FOR GUN SHOWS, AND THEN LATER, IT WAS EXTENDED TO INCLUDE ONLINE SALES. 40% OF GUNS ARE SOLD AT GUN SHOWS, ONLINE SALES. WE NEED TO CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE. SO THAT WHEN WE HAVE A UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECK --   IT WILL COVER EVERYBODY. ANOTHER LOOPHOLE IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE YOUNG MAN WHO MURDERED THE NINE PEOPLE AT BIBLE STUDY, IN THE CHURCH BASEMENT IN CHARLESTON -- APPLIED FOR A GUN. THE LOOPHOLES THAT THEY DON'T GET THE BACKGROUND CHECK DONE IN THREE DAYS, YOU CAN STILL GO BY THE GUN. IT TURNS OUT HE HAD A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND, AND YOU KNOW HOW RECORD-KEEPING IS. PEOPLE WILL START -- WERE STILL SEARCHING THROUGH IT. AT THE END OF THREE DAYS, HE GOES AND BUYS A GUN, AS WE DON'T YET HAVE IT AUTOMATED ENOUGH, WE DON'T HAVE INFORMATION SHARED FROM ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. AND HE GOT HIS GUN. AND WAS DETERMINED TO GO AND USE IT TO KILL NINE INNOCENT PEOPLE. WE ALSO MUST ADDRESS THE VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM OF MILITARY STYLE WEAPONS ON OUR STREETS.   YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T REALLY HAVE A CHANCE. LOTS OF TIMES, WHEN TERRIBLE MURDERS LIKE THIS TAKE PLACE, SOMEONE WILL SAY IF WE ONLY HAD MORE GUNS. YOU WALK INTO CLASS, YOU ARE DRIVING YOUR BABY AROUND IN A CAR SEAT, YOU ARE GOING TO CHURCH. AND SOMEBODY HAS AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON, OR EVEN WORSE -- AN ASSAULT WEAPON THAT IS A MILITARY INSTRUMENT OF WAR, AND YOU ARE SOMEHOW SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO STOP THAT WITH YOUR OWN GUN? THAT HAS NEVER MADE ANY SENSE.   AND SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM. DOMESTIC ABUSERS, PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS, THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER TRACKING AND RECORD-KEEPING. I REMEMBER THE TERRIBLE MASSACRE AT VIRGINIA TECH. THE SHOOTER THERE HAD BEEN INVOLUNTARILY COMMITTED. AND THERE WAS NO RECORD OF IT. AND IF THERE IS INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE EXCELLENT, -- EX FELONS, WHO ARE SUFFERING AND SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS, WHO ARE DOMESTIC ABUSERS, YOU GOT TO GET THAT INFORMATION INTO THE RECORD-KEEPING, SO THAT THE UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS WILL ACTUALLY SHOW YOU THAT HERE IS SOMEBODY WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE IT. PEOPLE SAY TO ME DOES THIS REALLY WORK? I CAN TELL YOU THIS. THE BEST DATA THAT WE HAVE IS THAT SINCE THE BRADY BILL IMPLEMENTED BACKGROUND CHECKS, MORE THAN 2.4 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN STOPPED FROM BUYING A GUN. AND OVER ONE MILLION OF THOSE WERE FELONS. THERE WERE RECORDS OF THOSE PARTICULAR POTENTIAL PURCHASERS.   AND I WANT TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU. I WANT TO WORK WITH SENSIBLE GUN SAFETY ADVOCATES AS WELL AS GUN OWNERS. I WANT TO WORK WITH PEOPLE FROM THE GRASSROOTS UP COME ALL THE WAY TO WASHINGTON. BECAUSE HOW MUCH LONGER WILL WE JUST SHRUG? OH MY GOSH, SOMETHING ELSE TERRIBLE HAPPENED. WHETHER IT'S IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, OR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. OR, THE MURDER OF CHILDREN IN THEIR CLASSROOMS? WE ARE TO GO TO THE TOWN HALL PORTION OF THIS. BUT I WANT TO ASK ONE OF THE MOTHERS FROM SANDY HOOK, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND, TO JUST COME JOIN ME FOR A MINUTE. BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO HEAR FROM HER. BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE PARENTS --   YOU KNOW, SO MANY OF THE PARENTS OF THESE PRECIOUS CHILDREN WHO ARE MURDERED HAVE TAKEN THE UNIMAGINABLE GRIEF THAT THEY HAVE BEEN BEARING, AND HAVE TRIED TO BE THE VOICES THAT WE NEED TO HEAR. I WANT YOU TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND MAYBE TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU AND OTHER PARENTS ARE TRYING TO DO TO GET THE CHANGES THAT ARE NECESSARY.  THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, I THINK WE JUST HEARD REALLY REINFORCES HOW NOBODY KNOWS WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T DONE WHAT WE NEED TO DO. TO TRY AND MAKE ANY OF US, BUT PARTICULARLY OUR CHILDREN, SAFE. THAT'S WHAT BEHIND THE PROPOSALS I'M MAKING. THEY ARE NOT NEW. THERE'S NOTHING UNIQUE ABOUT THEM, OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT I AM SO DETERMINED WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO GET THIS DONE.   I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE. WE HAVE A BIG GROUP FROM MOMS DEMAND ACTION, AND FROM DAD'S AS WELL. I WANT TO COMMEND THEM. THEY ARE GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION THAT IS REALLY TRYING TO BRING THESE ISSUES TO THE PUBLIC ATTENTION. WE NEED MORE OF THAT. I HAVE SAID WE NEED A MOVEMENT, THAT PEOPLE REALLY WILL BE PART OF, NO MATTER WHAT OTHER ISSUES THAT IS ON YOUR MIND, THAT YOU CARE ABOUT -- OUR SAFETY. THE GREAT HOPE THAT WE CAN PROTECT PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING ABOUT THEIR DAILY BUSINESS SHOULD BE AT THE TOP. AND THEREFORE, I'M REALLY ASKING EVERYBODY, REGARDLESS OF POLITICS OR PARTISANSHIP OR CANDIDATES OR ANYTHING ELSE TO THINK OF THE WAYS THAT EACH OF US CAN DO MORE TO TRY TO PROVIDE THAT MEASURE OF GUN SAFETY THAT WILL SAVE LIVES AND PREVENT VIOLENCE. LET ME START BY ASKING PEOPLE, IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING WHERE YOU HAVE A COMMENT TO MAKE ON THIS, OR ANY ISSUE, I WOULD LIKE TO START THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE SPECIFICALLY ON THIS ISSUE AND I WANT TO BE SURE TO HEAR FROM THEM. FORMER CONGRESSMAN DIX SWEAT, HELLO.  ELECTIONS. THANK YOU.  HILLARY CLINTON: THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL, WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT, THAT'S FOR SURE. THIS GENTLEMAN IN THE GREEN  THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YES, THE LADY RIGHT HERE. HERE COMES THE MICROPHONE.  I AGREE WITH YOU. WHAT SHE IS REFERRING TO IS THAT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOOKING AT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES. IF THERE IS DIRTY WATER THAT IS MAKING PEOPLE SICK, WE ARE EXPECTING THEM TO TELL US WHAT TO DO TO PREVENT THAT. SO, THEY WERE RESEARCHING GUN AND VIOLENCE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT'S VIOLENCE? WHAT KINDS OF WARNING SIGNS MIGHT THERE BE? AND FOR VERY SAD REASONS, BASICALLY, YOU'RE RIGHT. THE REPUBLICANS STOPPED THE RESEARCH. IT EVEN GOES FURTHER THAN THAT. THERE IS A LAW IN FLORIDA -- I WANT YOU TO HEAR THIS BECAUSE IT WAS SO SHOCKING AT FIRST THAT I REALLY DIDN'T BELIEVE IT. THERE IS A LAW IN FLORIDA THAT MAKES IT A FELONY FOR A PEDIATRICIAN TO TALK WITH FAMILIES ABOUT BEING SURE THEY KEEP GUNS SAFELY AWAY FROM CHILDREN. LITERALLY, A DOCTOR CAN GO TO JAIL IN FLORIDA. IF YOU ARE A PEDIATRICIAN, AND YOU ARE RUNNING THROUGH CHECKLISTS, ARE YOU KEEPING THE HOUSEHOLD POISONS OUT OF THE WAVE YOUR KIDS? ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE TODDLERS EXPLORING EVERYTHING. YOU MAKE SURE YOUR SHARP KNIVES ARE KEPT AWAY, ARE THEY HIGH ENOUGH UP SO KIDS CAN'T ACCIDENTALLY GET THEM? IT SEEMS PERFECTLY REASONABLE TO ME TO SAY IF YOU HAVE GUNS IN THE HOUSE, ARE YOU SURE THEY ARE REALLY SECURE? BECAUSE TOO MANY LITTLE KIDS GET A HOLD OF THEM. WE READ ABOUT IT EVERY WEEK. THEY KILL THEMSELVES, THEY KILL THEIR FRIENDS. I THINK IT IS A DOCTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY TO WORK WITH THE FAMILY SO THAT THE FAMILY CAN TRY AND KEEP THEIR BABIES SAFE. IF YOU ARE IN FLORIDA, YOU COULD GO TO JAIL. I WANT TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT AND YOU WILL WORK TOWARDS THE AND WILL WORK TOWARDS THE RESULTS THAT WE CAN LEARN A LOT MORE ABOUT WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE GUNS? IN YOUR AS WE WERE JUST HEARING YOU R-ARIZONA AND OR FROM THE GENTLEMAN FROM ARIZONA, AS WE AND YOU ARE GENTLEMAN FROM ARIZONA, AS WE ARE LEARNING YOU MORE, CERTAINLY WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE KILLER FROM SANDY HOOK, NOW THE KILLER FROM WILL AND OREGON, THERE PROBABLY WERE SOME COMMENTS, SOME ACTIONS THAT MIGHT HAVE SET OFF SOME WILL ALARMS AND PEOPLE. AND YOU IN PEOPLE -- IN PEOPLE. BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE THE GOOD INFORMATION SO THAT PEOPLE CAN BE BETTER INFORMED, HOW DO WE HELP THEM? I AGREE WITH YOU. NO ISSUE SHOULD BE BEYOND STUDY IN AMERICA. THAT'S LIKE A DENIAL OF EVERYTHING WE BELIEVE IN OUR COUNTRY.   GOING ALONG WITH THAT, SO FAR AS I KNOW, THE GUN INDUSTRY AND GUN SELLERS ARE THE ONLY BUSINESS IN AMERICA THAT IS TOTALLY FREE OF LIABILITY FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR. NOBODY ELSE IS GIVEN THAT IMMUNITY. AND THAT JUST ILLUSTRATES THE EXTREMISM THAT HAS TAKEN OVER THIS DEBATE. I WAS REALLY STRUCK WHEN HE WAS READING THE LETTER FROM RONALD IN REAGAN. AND THE FACT THAT WHEN HE WAS FACING A VERY HARD CHOICE, WHICH MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE COST HIM HIS SEAT IN CONGRESS, BECAUSE HE WILL VOTED FOR THE CRIME BILL WHICH CONTAINED THE BRADY BILL, WHICH LED TO THE BACKGROUND CHECKS, WHICH LED TO MORE THAN 2 MILLION PEOPLE NOT GETTING GUNS WHO WERE FELONS OR DOMESTIC ABUSERS, OR OTHERWISE INELIGIBLE -- HE PAID A BIG PRICE FOR THAT. AND HERE'S A LETTER FROM RONALD REAGAN. IN WHEN THE NRA WAS ON ONE OF AN THEIR TIRADES, CALLING THE IS AN ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND WILL ARE YOU AS YOU YOU ARE FIREARMS ENFORCERS JACKBOOTED YOU THUGS, PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. AND BUSH RESIGNED AS AN NRA WILL MEMBER AND SAID NO, I'M NOT GOING TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.   IDEALLY, WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IS GUN OWNERS, RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS, FORM A DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION AND TAKE BACK THE SECOND AMENDMENT FROM THESE EXTREMISTS.   OK.  THANK YOU. THIS LADY RIGHT THERE. HERE COMES THE MICROPHONE.  THANK YOU. FIRST, I WANT TO SAY HOW DISTRESSED I AM BY THE BOMBING OF THE HOSPITAL. IN AND I KNOW THAT DEFENSE IN SECRETARY CARTER HAS SAID HER THERE WILL BE A FULL THOROUGH INVESTIGATION TO TRY AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT. BUT IT IS DEEPLY REGRETTABLE. IT CAME WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF AND THE TALIBAN TAKING BACK OVER YOU GO A CITY IN THE NORTH, AND TO THE DOOR THE AFGHAN ARMY, AND HE THE AFGHAN ARMY, WHICH HAS PERFORMED VERY BRAVELY -- HAS PERFORMED VERY BRAVELY --AND THIS IS NOT AN ARMY THE RUNS I AND AWAY. THIS IS AN ARMY THAT STANDS IN YOU WILL A LOT OF -- AND FIGHTS. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE, THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS THEY ARE TRYING TO BE. I THINK THAT WE HAVE GOT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND THE AFGHAN MILITARY TO SUPPORT THEM. BECAUSE THEY ARE FIGHTING. IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD, BUT THEY'RE IN AFGHANISTAN, PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING FOR THE GAINS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE LAST 13, 14 YEARS. THERE STILL IS A LOT OF CONFLICT, THERE STILL IS A LOT OF DANGER. BUT TALIBAN IS NOT GOING AWAY. WE KNOW THAT. BUT THERE HAS BEEN SO MANY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS. NUMBER THE NUMBER OF GIRLS AND WOMEN IN SCHOOL, AT WORK, STUDYING IN THE UNITED STATES, GOING HOME TO TRY AND HELP THEIR COUNTRY, BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOW ABLE TO OPERATE NOW AS OPPOSED TO BEING UNDER THE SUM AND FOR THE -- UNDER THE THUMB OF THE TALIBAN AND BEING FORCED TO BASICALLY PAY TRIBUTE ALL THE TIME TO THE TALIBAN -- OR HAVE BEEN A LOT OF ADVANCES IN HEALTH. AFGHANISTAN HAD THE WORST MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE IN THE WORLD, AND THINGS TO HELP FOR NOT JUST THE UNITED STATES, BUT OTHER COUNTRIES, WORKING WITH AFGHAN DOCTORS AND NURSES, MOTHERS ARE SURVIVING AND CHILDBIRTH. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE SO BASIC, THAT ARE NOW SO MUCH BETTER IN AFGHANISTAN. I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT I WILL BE FACING IN JANUARY OF 2017. BUT AFGHANISTAN IS A COUNTRY THAT HAS TRIED. AND THE PEOPLE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON GETTING BEYOND THE VIOLENCE IN THE EXTREMISM FROM THE TALIBAN. AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD JUST WALK AWAY. I WILL DO WHAT I CAN TO HELP.   HERE COMES THE MICROPHONE.  CALL YOU THAT -- HILLARY  OR YOU CAN AHILLARY CLINTON: OR YOU CAN CALL ME VAL.    >> OR VAL. MY QUESTION IS, LAST WEEK A REPORTER ASKED DR. BEN CARSON ONE QUESTION. THAT QUESTION WAS, AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN ADVANCE TO ASSIST THE FOLKS OF A HORRIBLE EVENTS LIKE LETTER HURRICANE JOAQUIN. HE KEPT A VERY SHORT AND TO THINK OR DO -- SUCCINCT AND HIS THREE WORD ANSWER WAS -- I DON'T KNOW. ALONG WITH THAT, AS YOU SAID LAST WEEK, A REPORTER ASKED JEB BUSH WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT THE TRAGEDY IN ORDER ON -- IN ORGAN -- IN OREGON. HIS RESPONSE TO THAT HORRIFIC TRAGEDY WAS STUFF HAPPENS. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW FROM YOU -- YOU EXPLAIN TO THIS AUDIENCE AND TO THE NATION, WHY THOSE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN YOUR RESPONSES, AND WHY, AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU ARE READY TO LEAD FROM DAY ONE. THANK YOU.   LET'S TAKE THE NATURAL DISASTER QUESTION FIRST. BECAUSE HURRICANE JOAQUIN WAS ON EVERYONE'S MIND. THANKFULLY, IT DIDN'T HIT AS HARD AS THEY FEARED, ALTHOUGH SOUTH CAROLINA IS GETTING BATTERED WITH TERRIBLE TORRENTIAL RAIN. I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISIONS ANY NEW PRESIDENT HAS IS WHO IS GOING TO RUN FEMA, AND WHO IS GOING TO BE PREPARED TO WORK WITH CITIES, STATES, AND THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO GET PREPARED FOR INCOMING NATURAL DISASTERS, TO AND GET PRE-POSITIONED THE EQUIPMENTS AND THE FOOD AND THE EXPERTS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO HELP PEOPLE. I WILL TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY. LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS REAL, HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE, NOT FROM 30,000 FEET FLYING OVER IT, VERY WILL BUT WHO HAS BEEN THERE, WHO IS HAD TO GO IN AND FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO TO HELP AND FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO TO HELP PEOPLE EVACUATE, WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE TO TRY TO DO I AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO HELP WILL PEOPLE SAVE THEIR HOMES, BUT NOT STAY IN THEIR HOMES. THERE'S JUST A LOT OF HARD-WON ARE WISDOM. IN BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, WE YOUR ARE SEEING AN INCREASED NUMBER OF WEATHER EVENTS. WILL ALL OVER THE WORLD, NOT JUST IN OUR COUNTRY. WE NEED A MAPPING PROJECT. AND WILL AND I WILL GIVE YOU A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY I WILL DISAGREE SO PROFOUNDLY WITH THE CURRENT REPUBLICANS, WE'VE HEARD THE LETTER FROM RONALD WILL YOU AND REAGAN, I TOLD YOU ABOUT PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH. THE CURRENT REPUBLICANS IN THE I CONGRESS ARE TRYING TO CUT DRAMATICALLY THE MONEY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUTS IN TO WEATHER FORECASTING. TO ME, THAT IS SO PENNY WISE, AND POUND FOOLISH. A WIDE WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE WEATHER FORECASTING. NOT ONLY FOR AGRICULTURE AND YOU WILL KNOW, EVERYDAY OCCURRENCES, BUT ALSO TO GET AHEAD OF NATURAL DISASTERS AND EVENTS LIKE BIG STORMS. AND YOU ARE MORE THAN I WILL A I WILL WILL APPOINT GOOD PEOPLE, I WILL LOOK ACROSS THE GOVERNMENT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER SO THAT WE HAVE EXCELLENT COMMUNICATION WITH STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AND THAT WE KEEP PEOPLE WELL-INFORMED, SO THEY CAN MAKE GOOD DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES. AND THAT WE MOVE REALLY QUICKLY TO COME IN AFTER SOMETHING'S OR HAPPENED, BECAUSE WE CAN'T WILL YOU AND THEIR STOP THE WEATHER, WE KNOW THAT. BUT TO BE REALLY READY TO GET IN THERE TO HELP THE CLEANUP AND THE RECOVERY. I THINK THAT PEOPLE NEED TO BE EMPOWERED TO HELP THEMSELVES TO. I'M A LITTLE WORRIED THAT ARE A SOMETIMES THE FEDERAL YOU AND GOVERNMENT HAS THE YOU MESSAGE OF DON'T DO ANYTHING WILL MESSAGE OF DON'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL WE GET THERE. THAT'S NOT MY MESSAGE. HELP EACH OTHER, HELP FIX THE YOU AND PROBLEM, HELP WORK, TAKE PICTURES AND REPORT THINGS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEN THEY SAY I WANT TO GET SOME HELP FROM THE DISASTER ASSISTANCE FUNDING, THEY ARE TOLD WE SHOULD HAVE LEFT IT ALONE. NO, YOU SHOULDN'T LEAVE IT ALONE. SHOULD BE OUT THERE HELPING YOUR NEIGHBORS. EVERYONE IN THE WORLD HAS A CELL PHONE. KEEP A RECORD OF IT SO WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, FEMA, SMALL BUSINESS A ADMINISTRATION, WILL OTHERS SHOW UP YOU CAN SAY HERE IS WHAT WE HAD RIGHT AFTER THE STORM, HERE IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING TO CLEAN UP. HERE'S WHAT WE SPENT ON WHY IS ON YOUR -- WHAT WE SPEND ON PLYWOOD AND BOARDING, AND THE BIG VACUUMS TO CLEAN UP THE DIRT. I'M VERY HANDS-ON, VERY PRACTICAL, VERY LET'S GET IT DONE. THAT'S HOW I VIEW THAT.   ALL MY GOODNESS. THIS YOUNG LADY RIGHT THERE.  THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. CAN I ASK YOU HOW OLD YOU ARE RIGHT NOW?  SO I HAVE A LITTLE TIME, BUT NOT A LOT.    FIRST OF ALL, I WANTED TO TRULY BE THE COUNTRY WE ALL LOVE AND CHERISH. AND HAS GIVEN SO MUCH TO EVERYONE OF US WHO IS HERE IN THIS ROOM TODAY. THAT STILL HOLDS OUT THAT SAME PROMISE TO YOU, BUT IF YOU WORK HARD AND YOU DO YOUR PART, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD, AND STAY AHEAD, AND PURSUE YOUR DREAMS. THAT'S WHAT I WANT FOR EVERY YOUNG PERSON IN OUR COUNTRY. THAT MEANS WE GOT TO GET THE ECONOMY WORKING BETTER SO IT IT PRODUCES MORE JOBS WITH RISING INCOMES, AND I HAVE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THAT. BUT IT'S REALLY CRITICAL, BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO FEEL LIKE WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE TO DO, YOU'RE GOING TO BE PART OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY OF OURS. I WANT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM -- IS THAT LIKE IT'S WORKING PRETTY WELL FOR YOU. I WANTED TO WORK FOR EVERYBODY. AND PARTICULARLY, STARTING WITH OUR YOUNGEST KIDS TO GET THEM OFF TO A BETTER START SO THAT THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL. AND I WANT COLLEGE TO BE AFFORDABLE FOR YOU, SO WE GOT TO GET THE COST DOWN.   I HAVE OUTLINED WHAT I CALL THE NEW COLLEGE COMPACT TO DO JUST THAT. I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH AMBITION, TALENTS, A GOOD WORK ETHIC, NOT BE ABLE START SCHOOL OR FINISH SCHOOL BECAUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. AND THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. WE HAVE GOT TO DEAL WITH THAT, AND WE'VE GOT TO GET THE COST DOWN SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T GO INTO DEBT. I AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE HAVE TO REFINANCE THE DEATH OF PEOPLE HAVE SO THEY CAN BE MORE FREE TO PURSUE THEIR OWN INTERESTS, AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY MOVE OUT OF THEIR PARENTS HOMES AND MAYBE RENT OR BUY ONE. AND GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES. WITH HEALTH CARE, I WANT US TO HAVE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WHO HAVE INSURANCE, SO THEY HAVE QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. I WANT US TO DEAL WITH THE BIG SUBSTANCE ABUSE EPIDEMIC, SO THAT WE BEGIN TO TURN THE TIDE ON HEROIN AND PILLS, AND OTHER ADDICTIONS THAT ARE RUINING PEOPLES LIVES. AND GOING BACK TO THE GUN DISCUSSION, WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE MORE TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH, WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP MORE PEOPLE GET THE TREATMENT, ASSUMING IT IS AVAILABLE.   I WANT THE WORLD TO BE SAFER, I WANT THE WORLD THAT YOU WILL BECOME AN ADULT IN THE STILL BE LED BY THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE. THE UNITED STATES, IF WE DON'T LEAD, NOBODY LEADS. WE HAVE A VACUUM. THE VACUUM IS FILLED BY A LOT OF BAD ACTORS, INCLUDING TERRORIST GROUPS WHO WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR NEIGHBORS AND EVENTUALLY EVEN THREATEN US. AND I WANT TO PROTECT OUR RIGHTS, OUR CIVIL RIGHTS, HUMAN RIGHTS, GAY RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHTS. I WANT TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF AMERICANS.   WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. I CAN'T POSSIBLY, EVEN AS PRESIDENT, DO ALL OF THAT. IT HAS TO BE DONE BY EVERYBODY WORKING TOGETHER. EVERYBODY STANDING UP FOR THE KIND OF COUNTRY THAT WE WANT TO LIVE IN, THAT WE WANT TO SEE FOR OUR CHILDREN. I'M A GRANDMOTHER, AS MAYBE YOU KNOW. I WILL JUST SAY THIS. I AM THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FACTORY WORKER. MY GRANDFATHER WORKED AT THIS GRAND LEASE MEALS -- MILLS, AND HE DID IT TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY AND SO HIS SONS OF HAVE A BETTER LIFE. AND THEY DID. ALL THREE OF HIS SONS ENDED UP GOING TO COLLEGE. MY DAD STARTED A SMALL BUSINESS. IT WAS REALLY SMALL, BUT IT PROVIDED A GOOD MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE FOR US. HERE I AM, THIRD-GENERATION, ASKING ALL OF YOU TO ELECT A PRESIDENT. THAT IS THE AMERICAN STORY. I WILL DO WHATEVER I CAN, AS WILL MY HUSBAND, TO HELP OUR GRANDDAUGHTER HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE LIFE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. IT'S NOT ENOUGH. AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FORMER PRESIDENT OR SECRETARY OF STATE TO BELIEVE YOU CAN FULFILL YOUR DREAMS IN OUR COUNTRY. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE THE AND GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FACTORY WORKER OR THE GRANDSON OF A TRUCK DRIVER AND HAVE THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY. SO EVERY SINGLE DAY, I'M GOING TO WAKE UP IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND I'M GOING TO SAY TO MYSELF, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO TODAY TO MAKE SURE EVERY CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY HAS A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. THAT IS MY MISSION AS PRESIDENT.   SO MANY HANDS. RIGHT THERE. I WILL GIVE YOU MY MICROPHONE.  THANK YOU. SADLY, HER QUESTION REALLY POINTS TO WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY, WHERE OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS, BECAUSE OF THE GREAT RECESSION, BECAUSE OF THE HUGE LOSS OF JOBS AND WEALTH THAT PEOPLE HAD BUILT UP BEFORE 2007, 2008, POVERTY IS ON THE INCREASE. TODAY, 51% OF THE CHILDREN IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR LOW OR REDUCED COST OR FREE LUNCHES. AND WE WERE ON A GOOD PASS, MAY -- WE WERE ON A GOOD PATH, MAY I SAY, IN THE 90. -- 90'S. WE WERE ON A GOOD PASS TO LIFT MORE PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY, AND BY LIFTING FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY, YOU HELPED TO LIFT CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS, DO ALL OF THAT AGAIN. I GIVE PRESIDENT OBAMA ENORMOUS CREDIT FOR TAKING US OUT OF A DEEP DITCH THAT HE WAS IN WHEN THE REPUBLICANS LEFT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS WE HAVE TO DO. THE TOP OF THE LIST IS MORE JOBS, RAISE THEM IN WAGE SO THAT PEOPLE WHO WORK FULL TIME ARE -- RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE SO PEOPLE WHO WORK FULL-TIME ARE NOT STILL LIVING IN POVERTY, AND THEY CAN PROVIDE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. MORE JOBS IN GENERAL, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT PROJECTS, WE HAVE A LOT OF ROADS AND BRIDGES AND RAIL TRACK AND AIRPORTS AND PORTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN OUR COUNTRY THAT IS DETERIORATING, ENTITIES TO BE BUILT UP, YOU -- AND IT NEEDS TO BE BUILT UP, MAINTAINED, SO WE ARE MORE COMPETITIVE ECONOMICALLY. THAT WOULD PUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO WORK. AND I THINK WE CAN COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE BY MORE CLEAN ENERGY JOBS, WHICH WOULD BE MILLIONS OF JOBS AND BUSINESSES, IF WE SHIFTED THE INCENTIVES THAT ARE STILL IN THE TAX CODE AND OTHER PARTS OF OUR GOVERNMENT FOR FOSSIL FUELS TO WIND AND SOLAR AND ADVANCED BIOFUELS, WE WOULD BE A HEAD ON THE CLIMATE CHANGE FRONT, AND WE WOULD BE PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK, AND WE ARE ALREADY SEEING THAT IN SOME PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY. WE JUST NEED TO DO IT ALL THE WAY ACROSS. I THINK PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR CORPORATIONS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE IN THE PROFITS, NOT JUST THE CEOS, BUT EVERYBODY. UP AND DOWN THE LINE IN THOSE COMPANIES. VERY MUCH LIKE MARKET BASKET, PLACE YOU ALL KNOW, BECAUSE THEY NOW HAVE PROFIT-SHARING FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES. I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS, WHICH CREATES 60% OF THE JOBS IN AMERICA. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE BEHIND IN SMALL BUSINESS CREATION AND GROWTH. WE USED TO BE NUMBER ONE, WE ARE NOW NOT EVEN IN THE TOP 10. I WANT TO DO MORE AND MORE CREDIT, GET RID OF REGULATIONS AND LICENSING IN THE BARRIERS THAT STAND IN THE WAY FOR PEOPLE TO START THEIR BUSINESS, LIKE MY DAD DID. AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A GOOD MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. AND ONCE WE GET THE ECONOMY MOVING AGAIN, THEN WE CAN TURN OUR ATTENTION TO HOW WE CAN BE GOOD PARTNERS WITH FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN ARE AT HERE ARE SOME OF MY THOUGHTS, AND I HAVE WORKED IN THIS AREA FOR A VERY LONG TIME. FIRST AND FOREMOST, WE HAVE TO KEEP THEM SAFE. AND FREE FROM VIOLENCE BY STRANGERS OR THOSE WITHIN THEIR OWN HOMES AND FAMILIES. WE ALSO NEED TO HELP KIDS WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT MANY OF OUR KIDS, AND MY GRANDCHILD HAS TO GET AHEAD, THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO HAVE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION.   IT'S NOT JUST A NICE THING TO DO, IF YOU DON'T PREPARE KIDS IN THEIR FIRST FIVE YEARS, WHEN THEY GET TO SCHOOL, THEY WILL BE BEHIND. THERE WILL BE AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND THEN IT'S REALLY HARD FOR THE KID IN THE FAMILY OF THE SCHOOL TO CLOSE THAT GAP. I HAPPEN TO THINK TALENT IS EVERYWHERE. BUT I DON'T THINK OPPORTUNITY IS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE LOSING BECAUSE WE HAVE POOR KIDS WHO ARE NOT GIVEN A CHANCE TO REALLY GET OFF TO A GOOD START, WHOSE BRAINS ARE NOT BEING STIMULATED THIN -- IN THE WAY THAT WILL HELP THEM GET A VOCABULARY SO THAT THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL. I THINK THE EARLY CHILDHOOD PEACE OF THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. HEALTH CARE IS ESSENTIAL. I HELPED START THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM BACK IN THE 90'S TO TAKE CARE OF 8 MILLION KIDS.   AND THAT'S WHY I FIND STATES THAT DON'T WANT TO EXPAND MEDICAID TO BE REALLY MISSING THE BOAT. WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE HEALTHY. HOW CAN WE HAVE A COMPETITIVE ECONOMY IF THEY CAN'T GET THEIR BASIC HEALTH NEEDS MET? THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR KIDS. MY FIRST JOB OUT OF LAW SCHOOL WAS WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. WE WOULD GO INTO AREAS IN THE SCHOOLS AND KIDS COULDN'T SEE, WE STOPPED HAVING SCHOOL NURSES, WE STOPPED TESTING THEIR EYESIGHT. I FOUND OUT THAT I COULDN'T SEE IN FOURTH-GRADE. BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW I COULDN'T SEE VERY MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME TO FIND OUT, BUT I THOUGHT THE WORLD WAS A BIG IMPRESSIONIST PAINTING. I JUST GOT UP REALLY CLOSE TO THE TV SET. THEN WE HAD AND I EXAMINE SCHOOL -- THEN WE HAD AN EYE EXAM IN SCHOOL AND I FOUND OUT I REALLY CAN'T SEE. THERE ARE SO MANY KIDS THAT ARE NOT GETTING THOSE BASIC HEALTH NEEDS MET. THAT ALSO HOLDS THEM BACK. AND THEN OF COURSE, ONCE WE ARE IN SCHOOL, I THINK WE SHOULD START RESPECTING TEACHERS AGAIN WHO ARE ACTUALLY IN THE CLASSROOM WITH THE KIDS, AND TRY TO HELP THEM HELP THE CHILDREN. I LITERALLY COULD GO ON ALL DAY. I WILL JUST SAY ONE MORE THING. WE NOW HAVE A HUNGER PROBLEM AGAIN. A LOT OF US THOUGHT THAT WAS BEHIND US. WE HAVE BOTH A HUNGER AND A NUTRITION PROBLEM. WE HAVE MAYBE NOT THE KIND OF HUNGER THAT TURNS PEOPLE INTO WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY PHYSICAL MALNUTRITION. BUT WE DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE NUTRITION IN A LOT OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES, AND WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FAMILIES WHO UNDERSTAND HOW TO BEST FEED THEIR KIDS, BECAUSE WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD IS NOT NECESSARILY GOOD FOR THEIR KIDS. BUT IT'S AFFORDABLE. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO DO MORE WORK ON THIS TO GET BACK TO WHERE THERE ISN'T THAT SENSE OF EITHER HUNGER OR POOR NUTRITION I CAN REALLY AFFECT A CHILD'S DEVELOPED. THIS IS SOMETHING I WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT, BUT I WOULD ASK EVERYBODY TO HELP ME DO, BECAUSE THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE IN EVERY COMMUNITY, INCLUDING MANCHESTER. THE GENTLEMAN IN THE BLUE SHIRT.   YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. SOME OF YOU ARE MEMBER THAT. -- SOME OF YOU REMEMBER THAT, RIGHT? BACK IN THE 1980'S, WE HAD A LOT OF DEBATE OVER BIG INSTITUTIONS, WHERE PEOPLE WERE HOUSED, BUT IN MANY CASES, THEY WERE WAREHOUSED. AND THE RESULTS OF A LOT OF INVESTIGATIONS WHICH SHOWED HOW PEOPLE WERE NOT BE ADEQUATELY CARED FOR WAS TO SHUT DOWN A LOT OF THE INSTITUTIONS. AT THE SAME TIME, THOSE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO PEOPLE IF THERE WERE NO PLACE FOR THEM WERE GUARANTEED WE WOULD HAVE FUNDING AND TIMIDITY ALTERNATIVES FOR MENTAL HEALTH. SO WE SHUT DOWN THE INSTITUTIONS, BY AND LARGE, AND WE NEVER REALLY INVESTED WHAT WE SHOULD IN MENTAL HEALTH ALTERNATIVES. THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT I PUSH VERY HARD. AS YOU MENTIONED GUN VIOLENCE, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT IS OFTEN DIRECTLY RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. THE ADDICTION ISSUE, A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES ARE SELF-MEDICATING WITH ALCOHOL AND DRUGS. SO THAN THEY HAVE A DUAL PROBLEM THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED. I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE A AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WE HAVE TO ENFORCE THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE, THAT PEOPLE WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH CAN GET TREATMENT. THE RIGHT NOW, A LOT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES, A LOT OF STATES, A LOT OF BUSINESSES ARE NOT PROVIDING THE KIND OF SUPPORT YOU NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH. WHEN SOMEBODY IS EITHER CONVINCED, OR DECIDES TO SEEK MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS, THEY VERY OFTEN ARE TOLD WE HAVE NO PLACE FOR YOU, COME BACK IN SIX WEEKS OR THREE MONTHS, AND WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN. YOU KNOW WHERE MOST PEOPLE NOW WHO ARE PRESENTING WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS SHOW UP? THEY ARE IN OUR JAILS IN OUR PRISONS. IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE, BECAUSE THEY ARE HARM TO THEMSELVES OR TO OTHERS. THEY OFTEN ACT OUT IN A WAY THAT DRAWS ATTENTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND IN MOST PLACES IN THE COUNTRY, THERE IS NOWHERE ELSE FOR THEM TO GO, SO THEY ARE PUT IN JAIL. AND THEY MAY BE HELD THERE FOR A LONG TIME. WITHOUT ANY TREATMENT, AND IN THE END OF IN PRISON, THEY ARE STILL NOT GETTING ADEQUATE TREATMENTS. THE OTHER POINT I WANT TO SAY ABOUT THIS IS, BECAUSE WE HAVE OVER PRESCRIBED PAINKILLERS, THE OPIOIDS WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOTTEN VERY ADDICTED TO THEM. AND THAT CREATES A MENTAL STRAIN ON TOP OF WHATEVER OTHER PROBLEMS YOU MIGHT HAVE. AND SO WE NOW HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO TRY AND WITHDRAW. AND WE HAVE ABOUT 23 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED IN AMERICA. SO WHEN THEY GO FOR HELP, ONLY ONE IN 10 CAN GET IT. SEE YOU GOT THIS REAL DOUBLE WHAMMY, PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE GETTING -- ARE NOT GETTING HELP, PEOPLE WITH ADDICTION AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS ARE NOT GETTING HELP, AND YOU GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE TAKE RESOURCES AND TREAT BOTH PEOPLE SIMULTANEOUSLY, BECAUSE TOO OFTEN, THEY BECOME INTERCONNECTED. AND THEN WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM. I PLEDGE TO YOU, I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN, MORE FACILITIES, MORE TRAINED PEOPLE, MORE INSURANCE COVERAGE, MORE REVENUES. YOU CAN CALL ON SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW EVERYBODY.   THAT, AND ATTENTION. HE TOLD ME WE ONLY HAVE TIME FOR MORE QUESTION.  I WILL SPEAK FOR MYSELF. HE IS CLEARLY MORE THAN CAPABLE OF SPEAKING FOR HIMSELF. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DEBATE IN ABOUT EIGHT DAYS, SO WE WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO CONTRAST. BUT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE, AND I THINK EVERYBODY IS, HOW WE GET COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE, AND HOW WE REFINANCE STUDENT DEBT -- GO TO MY WEBSITE, HILLARY CLINTON.COM. IT'S CALLED THE NEW COLLEGE COMPACT, BUT VERY BRIEFLY, I DO HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH. FIRST OF ALL, MY APPROACH IS BEEN, THANKFULLY, ENDORSED BY A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE I THINK WHAT IT DOES IS IT ADDRESSES MANY ASPECTS OF THIS PROBLEM. FIRST, WE'VE GOT TO GET THE COST OF COLLEGE DOWN. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE TO QUIT RAISING TUITION AND COSTS ON STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. IF ALL WE DO IS TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE FREE COLLEGE, BUT WE DON'T REALLY PUT PRESSURE ON THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO LOWER THE COST, YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE COSTS GOING UP, AND THEN THE COST OF THE QUOTE FREE COLLEGE WILL GO UP. THAT TO ME IS UNSUSTAINABLE. FIRST AND FOREMOST, I WANT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES LOOKING AT, AND ADMINISTRATORS THEY NEED, HOW MANY BUILDINGS THEY NEED, CONNIE DIFFERENT COURSES ARE NO LONGER REALLY RELEVANT. LET'S TAKE A HARD LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING ON CAMPUS. YET THOSE COSTS DOWN SO WE CAN KEEP TUITION DOWN. SECONDLY, I HAVE SAID THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- I HAVE A PLAN, $350 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS. ABOUT $35 BILLION A YEAR, WHERE WE WOULD MATCH FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT THE STATE WOULD PUT IN TO MAKING COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THEIR STUDENTS, WE WOULD MATCH THEM FOR TO ONE. THEY WOULD HAVE TO AGREE ON SOME OF THESE CHANGES THE PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO GET THE MONEY. AND THEN, IF YOU CHOOSE A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY, I WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO GO WITHOUT BORROWING MONEY FOR TUITION, BUT I WILL EXPECT SOMETHING FROM YOU. LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, 10 HOURS OF WORK WEEK. I WORKED WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE, I WORKED WHEN I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL.   I WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT VALUE. AND YES, YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR IT. BUT IT WILL BE FOR A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY, POSSIBLE TO NOT BORROW MONEY FOR TUITION. FOR LIVING EXPENSES, I WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE PELL GRANTS TO BE USED FOR LIVING EXPENSES. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS NOW IS YOUNG PEOPLE WHO GET A PELL GRANT, THEY OFTEN FIND IT DOESN'T EVEN COVER TUITION ANYMORE. SO WE WILL DEAL WITH THE TUITION SIDE ON THE PUBLIC COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY. AND THEN WE WILL DEAL WITH THE LIVING EXPENSE SIDE. IF YOU DO HAVE TO BORROW MONEY, IT WILL BE WITH A LOW INTEREST RATE. AND I WILL FORGIVE LOANS TO PEOPLE WHO DO PUBLIC SERVICE JOBS AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME --   SO -- I HAVE TO TELL YOU. I DON'T THINK COLLEGE SHOULD BE FREE FOR DONALD TRUMP'S CHILDREN. I THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL OFF SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR COLLEGE. I'M INTERESTED IN THE MIDDLE CLASS, AND WORKING PEOPLE, AND POOR KIDS WHO DESERVE TO HAVE A BETTER SHOT AT GOING TO COLLEGE AND GRADUATING.   I FEEL STRONGLY THAT, WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE TO -- WHO HAS STUDENT DEBT STILL? OH, YEAH. WE HAVE 40 MILLION PEOPLE IN AMERICA WAS DOING DEBT. WHAT I WANT IS TO REFINANCE ALL THE STUDENT DEBT. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IF YOU HAVE A HOME MORTGAGE, OR YOU'RE MAKING CAR PAYMENTS, YOU CAN REFINANCE IT. WE FOR BID YOU FROM REFINANCING STUDENT DEBT. AND AT THE EVENT I DID EARLIER IN HOLLAND, A YOUNG WOMAN WAY IN THE BACK WHO SAID HER JUST RATE IS 12%. I WANT US TO REFINANCE IT, I WANT TO PROVIDE EVERYBODY THE CHANCE TO PAY BACK THEIR LOANS AS A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME. IF YOU ARE A FIREFIGHTER OR SCHOOL PRINCIPAL, OR SOCIAL WORKER, OR A POLICE OFFICER -- WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING THAT YOU WANT TO DO, BUT YOU ARE NOT MAKING A LOT OF MONEY, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO PAY BACK AT THAT HIGH INTEREST RATE. YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PAY BACK AT ABOUT 10% OF YOUR INCOME. WHEN I GOT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL I WENT TO WORK FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND, I DIDN'T GO TO A BIG LAW FIRM, I WENT TO WORK FOR A NONPROFIT BECAUSE I WANTED TO WORK ON BEHALF OF KIDS. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH THAT THE UNIVERSITY AT THAT TIME OFFERED ME THE CHANCE TO PAY IT BACK AS A PERCENTAGE. BOTH BILL AND I HAD LOANS, AND HE WAS A LAW PROFESSOR AND I BECAME A LAW PROFESSOR. WE WERE MAKING $14,000, $17,000 A YEAR. WE WERE PAYING BACK OUR LOANS BY WHAT WE CAN AFFORD. I WANT THIS TO BE, AS I SAY, A COMPACT. WHERE PEOPLE DO THEIR PART, OBVIOUSLY, YOUNG PEOPLE HOW TO DO THEIR PART, FAMILIES HAVE TO DO WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD TO DO. COLLEGES HAVE TO PITCH IN AND GET THE COSTS DOWN. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL PARTNER WITH STATES. WE'VE HAD THIS EXAMPLE OF MEDICAID. IF THE STATE SAYS NO, WE DON'T WANT TO PARTNER WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THEN I WILL WRITE INSTITUTIONS LIKE THIS ONE. I DO WANT TO ME TO COLLEGES TO -- I DO WANT COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO BE AS INEXPENSIVE AS POSSIBLE, BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO TAKE. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.               ",Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton Remarks on Gun Violence

STUDENTS, FACULTY AND STUDENTS. PRESIDENT OF THE COLLEGE. AND I HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE PRIVILEGE TO THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, MRS. HILLARY CLINTON!  ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU A LITTLE ABOUT MYSELF.  I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN FLORIDA.  NOW, WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I NEVER TOOK MUCH INTEREST WHO WAS RUNNING IN PRESIDENT. MY FAMILIES SUPPORTED DEMOCRATS  AND WHOEVER ALIGNED THEMSELVES   WAS GOING TO ALIGN THEMS.  IT WASN'T UNTIL MY 12TH GRADE I  MET MY GOVERNMENT TEACHER WHO  COUNSELED STUPID TO NOT ONLY   LOOK WHAT A DEMOCRAT AND   REPUBLICAN MEEPS BUT RESEARCH  THE CANDIDATE WHO ARE GOING TO   BE INFLUENCING THE POLICIES AND  ULTIMATELY DECIDES WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITHIN THE FUTURE. WITH THAT, I CAN PROUDLY STAND   HERE AND SAY, THAT I CHOOSE HILLARY!   DIDN'T HE DO  A GREAT JOB? I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I AM SO PLEASED TO BE HERE AT BROWARD  COLLEGE, THIS GREAT CAMPUS, 30,000 STUDENTS HERE.    .  AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING ME.  I'M SO GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR WHAT  HE SAID ABOUT HIS CHOICE AND I   THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE  TO HELP US GET ORGANIZED IN FLORIDA SO WE WIN THE PRIMARY AND THAT WE WIN THE ELECTION.  I THINK CONGRESSMAN DEUTCH IS  HERE AND I THANK ALL THE OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS AND EXCITED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN AND BRING UP THE ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COUNTRY'S   FUTURE AND TO ALL OF YOU. BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR  DOING WHAT DARNELL IS DOING, AND THAT IS REGISTERING TO VOTE,   BEING ACTIVE IN THE CAMPAIGN, WORKING TO ELECT YOUR CANDIDATE, HOPEFULLY, ME --    SLIPTSLINT AND WHY THIS ELECTION IS SO IMPORTANT. I WANT TO SAY THAT MY CAMPAIGN   IS FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THE  ECONOMY WORKS TO RAISE INCOMES   AND PROVIDE JOBS TO EVERYBODY  WILLING TO WORK HARD AND DO YOUR PART!    I'M EXCITED   ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE AND I SAY THIS, BECAUSE I KNOW THE FACTS BACK ME UP, THE ECONOMY WORKS BETTER FOR AMERICA AND AMERICANS WHEN WE HAVE A   DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE!  YOU CAN LOOK  AT ALL OF THE STATISTICS, THEY   GO BACK A LONG WAY.  UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOWER. INCOMES ARE HIGHER.  EVEN THE STOCK MARKET IS HIGHER. AND, IN FACT, WHEN A REPUBLICAN  IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, YOU ARE   FOUR MORE TIMES LIKELY TO HAVE A RECESSION. NOW, I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO  ALL THE BEGINNING OF OUR COUNTRY TO PROVE THIS. THE PAST 35 YEARS. THREE REPUBLICANS AND TWO  DEMOCRATS, I'M PRIVILEGED TO   HAVE KNOWN BOTH OF THOSE DEMOCRATS --   EACH OF THEM GOT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. IN MY HUSBAND'S PLACE, IT WAS FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON TO RONALD REAGAN, CIVIL WAR, LOTS OF OTHER STUFF GOING ON AND TWO TEMPERATURES OF RONALD REAGAN AND ONE TERM OF GEORGE H.W. BUSH AND THE DEFICIT HAD GONE WAY UP AND LOOKED LIKE THERE WERE   PROBLEMS. RESESSIONARY PROBLEM. MY HUSBAND SAID IT'S SO MUCH WORSE AND SOMEBODY ASKED HIM,  WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU UNIQUE BRING TO WASHINGTON? AND HE SAID, MATH.   WE ARE GOING TO WORK FOR AMERICANS AND AT THE END OF EIGHT YEARS, 23 MILLION NEW JOBS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, INCOMES WENT UP FOR EVERYBODY, NOT JUST PEOPLE AT THE TOP, PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE, WORKING  PEOPLE, POOR PEOPLE, AND WE  ENDED UP WITH A BALANCED BUDGET AND A SURPLUS. ALONG CAME ANOTHER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT. AND THEY WEPT BACK TO THE FAILED POLICY OF TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMY.  THE DEBT WAS BACK UP AND WE WERE FACING THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND THEY TOOK THEIR OFF OFF THE MARKETS AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. SHORTLY AFTER THE 2008 ELECTION, I GOT A CALL FROM PRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA AND HE ASKED ME TO SEE HIM IN CHICAGO. I DIDN'T KNOW WHY. HE ASKED ME TO BE SECRETARY OF   STATE. WHEN I GOT THERE. HE SAID IT'S SO MUCH WORSE THAN  THEY TOLD US. I HEARD THAT BEFORE. AND INDEED, IT WAS.  WE WERE LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH. THE AUTO INDUSTRY WAS ON THE   BRINK OF COLLAPSE. ALL THOSE JOBS ALL THE WAY DOWN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND THE PRESIDENT SAID WE HAVE BIG JOBS PROBLEMS AT HOME.  HE SAID YOU DEAL WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE ISSUES AND  I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE  ECONOMY AND THAT'S WHAT HE DID. THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO HAVE A CASE OF COLLECTIVE AMNESIA AND FORGET IT WAS THEIR FAILED   POLICIES THAT PUT US IN THAT BIG DITCH. SO NOW, NOW WE HAVE DUG OUR WAY OUT, WE RECOVERED 13 MILLION JOBS. WE HAVE HAD GOOD GROWTH RATES THE LAST QUARTER. SO WE'RE STANDING BUT NOT YET RUNNING AGAIN. NOW, I'M NOT RUNNING FOR MY HUSBAND'S THIRD TERM, I'M RUNNING FOR MY FIRST TERM BUT  I'M GOING TO WORK FOR WHAT WORKS FOR THE ECONOMY OF THE UNITED STATES. WE'VE GOT TO GET WAGES GOING UP AGAIN. PEOPLE HAVE TO FEEL THAT THEIR HARD WORK IS PRODUCING SOMETHING FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES AND  WE HAVE TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. NOBODY WHO WORKS FULL-TIME ON A MINIMUM WAGE SHOULD BE MEYERED IN A MINIMUM WAGE. WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE WORK HARD AND THEIR WORK PRODUCE PROFITS,  THOSE PROFITS ARE NOT JUST SHARED WITH THE C.E.O.'S BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WORKED TO PRODUCE THEM.  I HAVE A WHOLE ECONOMIC PLAN   THAT IS FOCUSED ON RAISING INCOMES AND I WANT TO SEE US CREATE SOME REALLY GOOD JOBS FOR PEOPLE AGAIN. ONE OF THE WAYS WE ARE GO TO GO DO IT IS COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE BY TRANGSING TO CLEAN JOBS AND BUSINESSES AND YOU KNOW, IF  ANYBODY SHOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS, IT OUGHT TO BE THE PEOPLE  IN FL. YOU ALL ARE ON THE FRONT LINES   OF ALL THESE WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS. WE DON'T HAVE TO BE PESSIMISTIC  BUT BE DETERMINED ABOUT IT. SOME STATES ARE MOVING TOWARDS CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY.  I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN IOWA, AS YOU MIGHT GUESS, AND THEY ARE GETTING 30% OF THEIR ELECTRICITY FROM WIND. I CAME FROM MASSACHUSETTS, WHICH IS NOT KNOWN AS A SUNNY STATE AND THEY RANK NUMBER FOUR IN THE COUNTRY AS SOLAR POWER. I'M HOPING FLORIDA GETS ON TRACK WHEN IT COMES TO WIND, SOLAR AND ADVANCED FUELS AND SOME PEOPLE SAY, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST, MY RESPONSE IS TALK TO A SCIENTIST AND HEAR WHAT   THEY HAVE TO SAY, BECAUSE THIS   IS AN ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY, IT SHOULDN'T BE SEEN AS A DRAG BUT A WAY TO LIFT OUR SIGHTS AND DO WHAT WE SHOULD DO AND ACTUALLY   CREATE JOBS, MAKE BUSINESSES AND MAKE MONEY DOING IT. I HAVE SET TWO BIG GOALS.  I WANT TO INSTALL HALF A BILLION MORE SOLAR PANELS AND BY THE END OF MY SECOND TERM, ENOUGH SOLAR POWER. I'M EXCITED BY THIS CHALLENGE  AND I WANT EVERYBODY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN THINK IN YOUR HOME AND BUSINESS WORKING IN   YOUR CITY AND STATE. SOMETHING ELSE WE ARE GOING TO   DO TO CREATE JOBS. I WANT AN INFRASTRUCTURE BANK, A WAY TO FUND WHAT WE OUT TO DO TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN ROADS.  WE HAVE BRIDGES THAT ARE FALLING APART. WE HAVE SEWER LINES, WATER LINES, GAT PIPELINES, WE HAVE A  LOT OF WORK TO DO IN THIS  COUNTRY AND IT'S GOOD WORK AND   WE ARE IGNORING IT.  SOME OF YOU ARE ORIGINALLY FROM  NEW YORK. COMMAUPCHAUP  A STATE I WAS PRIVILEGED TO REPRESENT IN THE   UNITED STATES SENATE. AND A LOT OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS 70 TO 150 YEARS OLD.  SOME OF THE PIPES AND/OR THINGS  GOING UNDER THE GROUND, THEY ARE OLD AND SOME OF THEM ARE EXPLODING. YOU MIGHT READ THAT FROM TIME TO TIME.  YOU OUGHT TO GET AHEAD OF IT. IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT GROWING  OUR ECONOMY AND INCREASING   INCOME, THEN WE FINALLY ONCE AND FOR ALL, HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT  WOMEN GET EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK!  [CHEERS AND  YOU KNOW. THAT'S RIGHT. LET'S BREAK THE GLASS CEILING  AND BREAK IT IN EVERY WORKPLACE IN AMERICA. NOBODY AT WORK SHOULD BE   DISADVANTAGED. AND I GET LETTERS ALL THE TIME FROM WOMEN WHO ARE REALLY  FRUSTRATED AND MAYBE THEY ARE  THE SOLE SUPPORTER AND THEY  ASKED ME WHAT TO DO AND HOW THEY CAN BE TREATED FAIRLY AND  EQUALLY. I WANT TO MAKE THIS POINT. THIS IS A WOMEN'S ISSUE. BUT IT'S A FAMILY ISSUE AND AN ECONOMIC ISSUE. WE WILL GROW OUR ECONOMY MORE IF WE ACTUALLY DO WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING ANY WAY. REPUBLICANS ARE ALWAYS SAYING  WHENEVER I TALK ABOUT THIS,  THERE SHE GOES, PLAYING THE  GENDER CARD. IF ADVOCATING FOR EQUAL PAY FOR  EQUAL WORK IS PLAYING THE CARD,  THAT IS A HAND THAT I WILL PLAY! [CHEERS AND  BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS THE CENTRAL FOCUS OF WHAT I WANT TO DO AS PRESIDENT,  EDUCATION, FOR EXAMPLE.  I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO WHAT   WE MUST DO TO IMPROVE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION AND LISTENING TO AND RESPECTING  TEACHERS WHO ARE IN THE CLASSROOM! [CHEERS  THEY ARE THE  ONES THERE WITH THE KIDS ALL DAY AND THEY HAVE THE IDEAS. THEY SHOULD BE FIRST IN LINE AND WILL BE IN ANY TABLE I'M AT. BUT WE WILL NOT BE AS COMPETITIVELY KEAGS NEAL AS WE WANT TO BE IF WE DON'T HAVE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. THOSE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THOSE  LITTLE KIDS TO BE SUCCESSFUL OR NOT. I HAVE AN AMAZING, WONDERFUL GRANDCHILD AND WE READ AND TALK AND SING TO HER. HER FIRST WORDS, WE LOVE TO DO   IT AND WE DO IT BECAUSE IT BUILDS BRAIN CELLS.  80% OF YOUR BRAIN IS FORMED BY THE AGE OF THREE.  I WANT EVERY KID TO HAVE THE SAME SHOT, THE SAME CHANCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL. WE NEED A UNIVERSAL PRE- KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM AND THE   KIDS HAVE THE SAME CHALLENGES AND BIGGEST OBSTACLES TO OVERCOME SO EVERY KID HAS A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD TO CLIMB   THAT LADDER OF OPPORTUNITY. I THINK THAT EVERY PERSON SHOULD HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER RIGHT GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. SO I'M GOING TO DO ALL I CAN TO MAKE SURE OUR SMALLEST, YOUR YOUNGEST CITIZENS HAVE A CHANCE. ON THE OTHER END, WE ARE GOING   TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AGAIN!  AND WE ARE GOING TO GIVE ALL OF YOU THE CHANCE TO REFINANCE YOUR STUDENT DEBT AND BRING DOWN THE COSTS YOU ARE PAYING.  IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT. IF YOU CAN REFINANCE YOUR  MORTGAGE OR CAR PAYMENT, WHY CAN'T YOU REFINEANCE YOUR STUDENT DEBT AND I DON'T BELIEVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD MAKE A PROFIT OF LENDING YOU MONEY TO PURSUE YOUR EDUCATION. AND I'M A BIG FAN OF COMMUNITY   COLLEGES AND I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO IMPLEMENT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN TO MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGES FREE SO YOU   CAN AFFORD TO GO.  WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE, I'M GOING TO DEFEND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. I'M GOING TO DEFEND IT. IT'S WORKING. 18 MILLION PEOPLE ARE GETTING HEALTH CARE AND YOUNG PEOPLE GET TO STAY ON THEIR YOUNG FAMILIES' HEALTH CARE PLAN. OUT OF POCKET COSTS ARE TOO HIGH.  AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS WENT UP 12%.  I HAVE PUT FORTH A PLAN TO BRING THEM DOWN. A LOT OF DRUG MANUFACTURERS AREN'T HAPPY WITH ME, BUT IT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING THAT WHEN I  ROLLED MY PLAN OUT, IT WAS THE SAME DAY THAT A HEDGE FUDGE MANAGER DECIDED TO RAISE THE PRICE OF A LIFE-SAVING DRUG TOP  $750 A PILL. A $5,000% INCREASE.  WE CAN'T SUSTAIN THAT. WE HAVE TO GET A HAPPENED WILL   ON PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE WITH   DRUG COMPANIES TO BRING THE  PRICE DOWN. JUST THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A  MINUTE. YOU KNOW, TAXPAYERS, YOU AND I,  WE PAY FOR THE N.I.H. AND THE  CLINICAL TRIALS. WE PAY FOR THE F.D.A. WHETHER A  DRUG IS EFFECTIVE AND WE PAY THE HIGHEST PRICES FOR THOSE DRUGS. IF YOU ARE IN CARNEDA, YOU GET A NEGOTIATED PRICE, BUT NOT IN AMERICA. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE BEEN FROM   NORTHERN NEW YORK. WHEN I WAS YOUR SENATOR AND I WOULD SEE BUSLOADS OF PEOPLE TO BUY THE VERY SAME DRUGS FOR A LOWER COST.  WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO PAY THE HIGHEST PRICE FOR THE DRUGS. WE HAVE GOT TO BRING IN THIS IN. I HAVE A PLAN TO DO THAT. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, IT IS   DISTRESSING TO ME THAT FLORIDA,  AMONGST SOME OTHER STATES, REFUSE TO EXPAND MEDICAID TO   COVER MORE PEOPLE. IN FACT, I'M LOOKING HERE. IN FLORIDA, AS MANY AS 650,000   PEOPLE COULD HAVE GOTTEN COVERAGE UNDER MEDICAID. FEWER PEOPLE WITHOUT INSURANCE MEANS FEWER PEOPLE WHO GET   PREVENTIVE CARE. MORE VISITS TO THE EMERGENCY   ROOM.  IT MAKES NO SENSE ECONOMICALLY.  AND I HOPE THAT FLORIDA WOULD  RECONSIDER THAT, BUT YOUR  GOVERNOR AND THE REPUBLICANS IN  TALLAHASSEE -- BOO.  SLINTSLIPT THEY SAID NO TO   FAMILIES AND NO TO FAIRNESS. AND BECAUSE THEY SAID NO AND   REFUSE TO EXPAND MEDICAID,   PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING. PARTICULARLY WORKING POOR  PEOPLE, PEOPLE OF COLOR, PEOPLE  WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LEFT  OUT. IT MAKES NO ECONOMIC SENSE.  IT MAKES NONE. THE STATES WHO HAVE EXPANDED IT, HAVE SEEN LOWER NURNS RATE INCREASES AND NOT SEEING   EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND OTHER  EXPENSES, PROBLEMS.  I'M NOT GOING TO LET THE   REPUBLICANS KILL IT. THEY VOTED TO REPEAL IT 54   TIMES. I WILL CERTAINLY STAND IN THEIR WAY, BUT I WANT TO IMPROVE IT. I'M GOING TO TASK A LOT OF COSTS AND THREE OTHER ISSUES I WANT TO MENTION. ONE, WE ARE HAVING A CAREGIVING  CRISIS, ALEDS I'MER'S. FAMILIES ARE TAKING CARE OF  THEIR LOVED ONES.  I BET SOME OF YOU ARE. WE GIVE SO LITTLE HEP. WE NEED RESPITE CARE AND DAY CARE.  LET'S HELP THE CAREGIVERS GET  THE CARE THEY NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR LOVED ONES. [CHEERS AND  WE HAVE A   SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN AMERICA. HEROIN, METH, OTHER PRESCRIPTION DUGS AND PEOPLE ARE DYING. WE LOSE 18 TO 22 VETERANS A DAY FROM SUICIDE. A LOT OF THEM CAME BACK AND DIDN'T GET THE CARE THEY NEEDED  BUT GOT HANDED A BUNCH OF PILLS AND THEY GOT HOOKED. OUR JOB HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET MORE TREATMENT AND MORE SUPPORT SO PEOPLE CAN GET INTO RECOVERY.  23,000 PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED,  ONE IN 10 CAN GET COVERAGE. UNTREETED MENTAL HEALTH IS AN EXPENSIVE PROBLEM AND A LOT OF   PEOPLE END UP IN PRISON AND THEY SELF-MED INDICATE. THESE ARE EXPENSIVE AND HEARTBREAKING PROBLEMS. I'M CONVINCED WE CAN TACKLE THEM TOGETHER. WE HAVE TO STAND UP TO OUR CIVIL RIGHTS, OUR HUMAN RIGHTS,  BECAUSE THE OTHER SIDE WANTS TO PULL THEM BACK. SO I WILL DEFEND A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND I WILL FIGHT AGAINST DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD!  AND I WILL DEFEND AND FIGHT FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND AGAINST  DISCRIMATION!    AND I WILL FIGHT FOR VOTING RIGHTS FOR  EVERYBODY AND AGAINST STATES   THAT ARE TRYING TO RESTRICT THEM!  AND I WILL FIGHT TO FIGHT CITIZENS UNITED WHICH HAS OPENED THE DOOR TO DARK UNACCOUNTABLE   MONEY. I WILL FIGHT TO FIGHT FOR  IMMIGRATION REFORM BECAUSE IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR COUNTRY. I WILL MOVE AWAY FROM MASS INCARCERATION BECAUSE BLACK LIVES MATTER!    I WILL TELL   YOU, I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR NEW, EFFECTIVE GUN CONTROL MEASURES!  [CHEERS AND  I GOT TO TELL YOU, IT IS JUST HEARTBREAKING, IT IS SICKENING TO ME TO SEE ANOTHER MASSACRE. PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO   GO TO COLLEGE LIKE THIS ONE OR   GO TO THE MOVIE THEATER OR GO TO BIBLE STUDY. WHAT IS WRONG WITH US THAT WE  CAN'T STAND UP TO THE N.R.A. AND THE GUN LOBBY AND THE GUN MANUFACTURERS? [CHEERS AND  THIS IS NOT JUST TRAGIC. WE JUST DON'T NEED TO PRAY FOR   PEOPLE BUT TO ACT AND NEED TO  BUILD A MOVEMENT. IT'S INFURIATINGS, ANOTHER TIME  THERE IS A MASSACRE, REPUBLICANS IN THE N.R.A. SAYS NOW IS NOT  THE TIME TO TALK TO GUNS.  YES IT IS. IT IS TIME TO ACT. BUT REPUBLICANS REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT OUR  COMMUNITIES. THEY PUT THE N.R.A. AHEAD OF AMERICAN FAMILIES. IT IS WRONG AND WE NEED TO MAKE EVERY POLITICIAN WHO SIDES WITH  THEM TO LOOK INTO THE EYES OF  PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN MURDERED AND EXPLAIN WHY THEY  LISTEN TO THE GUN LOBBYISTS  INSTEAD. I'M WELL AWARE THAT THIS IS A POLITICAL MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB. BUT YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING DONE  IN THIS COUNTRY IF YOU DON'T   START BY CALLING IT OUT. AND WE HAVE HAD TOO MANY MURDERS, TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER GOTTEN GUNS IN THE FIRST PLACE, TAKING OUT WHATEVER THEIR RAGE, THEIR FURY, THEIR MENTAL PROBLEMSR BY KILLING  OTHER PEOPLE.  AND I WILL, AS YOUR PRESIDENT,   NEVER RELENT ON TRYING TO WORK ON THIS. BUT WE NEED A NATIONAL MOVEMENT. HERE'S WHAT THE OTHER SIDE   COUNTS ON. I DON'T THINK THEY REPRESENT A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS OR   MAJORITY OF GUN OWNERS, BUT THEY COUNT ON REALLY HAVING AN INTENSE, DEDICATED GROUP THAT  SCARE POLITICIANS AND SAY, WE WILL VOTE AGAINST YOU. AND PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO ARE HEARTSICK, HEARTBROKEN, DISGUSTED. WE CARE ABOUT COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG COST. BUT EACH OF US HAVE TO CARE  ABOUT THIS ISSUE.  THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL GUN RESTRICTION. HE PASSED THE BRADY BILL AND ELIMINATED ASSAULT WEAPONS FOR 10 YEARS. SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THEM ON. WE TOOK THEM IN THE 1990'S AND   TAKE THEM ON AGAIN. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. THAT'S WHY WE ARE GETTING STARTED HERE IN FLORIDA, HERE AT BROWARD COLLEGE, AND I WANT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU TO BE   INVOLVED IN THIS CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE TO HAVE AN AGENDA FOR CHANGE AND REACH AS MANY PEOPLE WE CAN TO MAKE THE CHANGE WE   WANT TO SEE. TO BUILD ON WHAT HAS WORKED AND TAKE IT FURTHER. AND NOT LET THE REPUBLICANS RIP  THE PROGRESS WITH THEIR OUT OF DATE, OUT OF TOUCH JDS OF IDEAS AND TURN US BACK. NOW, I AM AWARE WE HAVE  CHALLENGES AROUND THE WORLD. THAT'S WHY I THINK, MY SPREPS AS SECRETARY OF STATE, AS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK IS ESPECIALLY PERTINENT TO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO  TO MAKE SURE WE REMAIN SAFE AND SECURE.  WE LEAD WITH OUR VALUES AND IN PURSUIT OF OUR INTERESTS. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I   HAVE TO TELL YOU FOR ME WHAT GETS ME UP AND KEEPS ME GOING IS THE THOUGHT OF MY GRANDDAUGHTER AND NOT WHAT KIND OF LIFE SHE  HAS BECAUSE WE WILL MAKE SURE  LIFE AS POSITIVE AS IT CAN BE. WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WILL SHE  BECOME AN ADULT IN.  WHAT KIND OF WORLD WILL BE   WAITING FOR HER? I'M THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FACTORY WORKER. MY GRAD GRANDFATHER WORKED HARD  AND HE DID IT TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY AND WANTED HIS SONS TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE. THEY ALL WENT TO COLLEGE. HE WORKED HARD AND GAVE US A GOOD MIDDLE-CLASS LIFESTYLE AND  I'M ASKING YOU TO VOTE FOR ME FOR PRESIDENT. THAT'S WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO   HAPPEN IN AMERICA. WHATEVER YOUR DREAM MIGHT BE. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH THAT MY GRANDDAUGHTER WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES. IT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FORMER PRESIDENT OR FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HAS A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HER POTENTIAL, IT SHOULD APPLY TO FACTORY WORK TRIES AND IF I'M YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY WORKING TO MAKE SURE EVERY CHILD AND EVERY YOUNG PERSON HAS THAT ARE CHANCE TO  LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. IF YOU HELP ME, THAT IS WHAT WE  WILL DO TOGETHER. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH! [CAPTIONS COPYRIGHT NATIONAL   CABLE SATELLITE","Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton in Davie, Florida"

MY HEART IS JUST RACING. I AM SO, SO EXCITED TO BE HERE. GRATEFUL FOR EVERYTHING YOU AND THE STATE HAVE MEANT TO ME AND MY FAMILY. I AM HONORED TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF SO MANY PROUD NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATS.  AND ESPECIALLY, ESPECIALLY YOUR TERRIFIC GOVERNOR.  YOU ARE A AMAZING SENATOR, WHO USED TO BE GOVERNOR.   YOU KNOW, MAGGIE AND JEANNE ARE WOMEN WHO KNOW HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. AND THEY BRING COMMON SENSE AND COMMON PURPOSE TO EVERYTHING THEY DO. I ALSO WANT TO THANK CONGRESSWOMAN ANNIE KUSTER, ALL THE STATE SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES.  EXECUTIVE COUNSELORS, LOCAL LEADERS, GRASSROOTS ORGANIZERS. AND ESPECIALLY, VOLUNTEERS, WHO ARE WORKING THEIR HEARTS OUT FOR THIS CAMPAIGN.   I HAVE A GREAT IDEA. I THINK WE SHOULD JUST TRANSPORT ALL OF YOU WERE --EVERYWHERE WE GO AROUND THE COUNTRY TOGETHER.  YOU KNOW, AS MUCH FUN AS THIS IS, AS EXCITING AS THE ATMOSPHERE IN HERE IS, WE HAVE WORK TO DO AS DEMOCRATS. I WANT TO BE YOUR PARTNER TO BUILD OUR PARTY HERE IN THIS STATE AND ACROSS OUR NATION TO KEEP OUR PROGRESS GOING. WE HAVE, A LONG WAY, HAVEN'T WE, THESE PAST SIX AND A HALF YEARS? AND THANKS TO THE HARD WORK AND SACRIFICE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE, BARACK OBAMA --   WE ARE STANDING AGAIN, BUT WE ARE NOT YET RUNNING THE WAY AMERICA SHOULD. WAGES STILL ARE NOT RISING FOR MOST PEOPLE. THE COST OF EVERYTHING FROM COLLEGE TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS KEEPS GOING UP. INEQUALITY IS STILL TOO BIG A PROBLEM. YOU KNOW, IN AMERICA, IF YOU WORK HARD AND DO YOUR PART, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. THAT IS THE BASIC ARGAN OF THIS COUNTRY. -- BASIC BARGAIN OF THIS COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, THAT IS A PROMISE THAT MY GRANDFATHER BELIEVED IN WHEN HE WENT TO WORK EVERY DAY IN THE LACE MILLS. I AM THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FACTORY WORKER WHO BELIEVED IN AMERICA. AND THAT LIFE COULD BE BETTER FOR HIS CHILDREN. AND IT WAS. HIS THREE SONS WENT TO COLLEGE. MY DAD, AFTER SERVING IN THE NAVY IN WORLD WAR II, HE STARTED A SMALL BUSINESS. HE SAVED AND HE SACRIFICED, THE KINDS HE BELIEVED HIS SMALL BUSINESS, PRINTING FABRIC IN CHICAGO, TO PROVIDE US WITH A MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT DID. AND NOW, WITHIN THREE GENERATIONS FROM THAT FACTORY WORKER TO THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, I AM STANDING HERE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY WITHOUT WE LOVE. -- PRESIDENT OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY THAT WE LOVE.    AND SO THAT IS WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR HIS DEMOCRATS. WE ARE FIGHTING TO MAKE SURE THAT DREAM, THAT PROCESS, IS JUST AS VITAL AND REAL AS TOMORROW IN THE YEARS LATER AS IT WAS FOR MY FATHER AND GRANDFATHER. YOU KNOW, WHEN MY HUSBAND PUTS PEOPLE FIRST --   IN THE 1992 CAMPAIGN, WHERE NEW HAMPSHIRE WAS SO SUPPORTIVE, WHEN HE GOT INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD INHERITED REAL ECONOMIC PROBLEMS FROM HIS REPUBLICAN PREDECESSORS. THAT SEEMS TO HAPPEN, HAVE YOU NOTICED?  I SAY THIS WITHOUT TRYING TO BE PARTISAN OR PERSONAL, BUT THE ECONOMY JUST WORKS BETTER WHEN WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE.   AND SO, AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF HARD WORK AND POLITICAL HEAVY LIFTING, THE END OF BILL'S SECOND TERM OF THERE WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT STEP -- SET OF STATISTICS THAT REPRESENTED THE PROGRESS WE MADE. 23 MILLION NEW JOBS. A BALANCED BUDGET. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WAS MOST IMPORTANT TO ME? FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES, EVERYBODY BENEFITED. NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP, BUT PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE. PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM. EVERYBODY SAW THEIR INCOMES GO U P.   YOU KNOW, I WENT TO THE SENATE. THE GOOD PEOPLE OF NEW YORK SENT ME TO THE SENATE IN 2001. AND I WAS EXCITED, BECAUSE I THOUGHT, LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED. WE HAVE TURNED AROUND THE ECONOMY. WE HAVE TAKEN CONTROL OVER OUR FISCAL FUTURE. JUST THINK OF WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE WITH THAT BALANCED BUDGET AND A SURPLUS. WE COULD HAVE MADE SOCIAL SECURITY SOLVENT FOR AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE. WE COULD HAVE INVESTED IN EDUCATION AND SCIENCE AND RESEARCH TO MAKE US SMARTER AND STRONGER AND RICHER. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? THE REPUBLICANS WENT BACK TO TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS. ONE OF THE WORST IDEAS EVER TO COME OUT OF THE 1980'S, RIGHT ALONG WITH BIG HAIR.  THEY TOOK OF EYES OFF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, TOOK THEIR EYES OFF THE MORTGAGE MARKET. AND PRESIDENT OBAMA INVENTED -- INHERITED AN EVEN BIGGER MESS. I REMEMBER WHEN HE CALLED ME RIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION. ASKED ME TO SEE HIM IN CHICAGO. I DID NOT KNOW WHY AT THE TIME. TURNED OUT, HE WANTED TO ASK ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE. BUT WHEN I GOT THERE --    WHEN I GOT THERE, WHAT HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS HOW DANGEROUS THE ECONOMIC SITUATION WAS. HE SAID IT IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN THEY TOLD US. HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT A GREAT DEPRESSION, NOT JUST A GREAT RECESSION. AND HE HAD TO REALLY WORK HARD. UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP AND THANKS TO THE SACRIFICE OF SO MANY AMERICANS, WE PULLED BACK FROM THE BRINK OF DEPRESSION, SAVED THE AUTO INDUSTRY, CURBED WALL STREET ABUSES, AND PROVIDED HEALTH CARE TO 16 MILLION PEOPLE.   NOW, THE ONLY WAY THAT THE REPUBLICANS CAN WIN IS IS THAT THEY COUNT ON COLLECTIVE AMNESIA FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. PRESIDENT OBAMA DESERVES A LOT MORE CREDIT THAN HE GETS FOR HELPING US AVOID AN ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE.   AND I KNOW IT IS VERY INCONVENIENT FOR OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS, BUT THE FACTS HE SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. ECONOMIC GROWTH IS STRONGER UNDER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS. UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOWER. THE STOCK MARKET RISES FASTER. BUSINESSES DO BETTER. AND DEFICITS ARE SMALLER.  AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE INCONVENIENT FACTS -- UNDER REPUBLICANS, RECESSIONS HAVE BEEN FOUR TIMES AS CLEARLY AS UNDER DEMOCRATS. SO, ONE WOULD HAVE TO WONDER, WHY WOULD ANYBODY WHO CARES ABOUT THE ECONOMY -- WHICH IS ALL OF US -- WHY WOULD ANYBODY WHO CARES ABOUT SEEING PAYCHECKS RISE AGAIN, FIGHTING INEQUALITY, RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE, DEALING WITH THE CHALLENGES THAT CONFRONT US BELIEVE THAT GOING BACK TO THE FAILED POLICIES OF TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS WOULD HELP ANYBODY EXCEPT FOR THOSE PEOPLE AT THE TOP? YOU KNOW, I AM NOT RUNNING FOR MY HUSBAND'S THIRD TERM OR PRESIDENT OBAMA'S THIRD TERM. I AM RUNNING FOR MY FIRST TERM.   AND I WILL -- I WILL PROUDLY CARRY FORWARD THIS RECORD OF DEMOCRATIC ACHIEVEMENT. WE KNOW WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOES NOT. IT WORKS WHEN MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES GET A RAISE. THAT WILL BE MY MISSION FROM MY FIRST DAY AS PRESIDENT TO THE LAST. WE NEED GROWTH THAT IS STRONG, FAIR, AND LONG-TERM. SO THE REWARDS OF SUCCESS DO NOT JUST GO TO THOSE AT THE TOP. YOU KNOW, WHEN A COMPANY DOES WELL, SHAREHOLDERS AND EXECUTIVES ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO SHOULD RUN A FED. THE PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THAT COMPANY SHOULD AS WELL.   THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY PRODUCE THE PROFITS SHOULD SHARE IN THEM . IF THEY CAN WORK FOR MARKET BASKETS ACROSS NEW ENGLAND, IT CAN WORK ACROSS AMERICA.   BUT HERE'S WHAT DOES NOT WORK. WHEN 25 HEDGE FUND MANAGERS EARN MORE EACH YEAR THAN ALL OF THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS IN AMERICA COMBINED.  THERE IS A TAX LOOPHOLE THAT LETS THEM TREAT THEIR PAY LIKE A INVESTMENT GAMES -- YOU HAVE HEARD OF IT. THE CARRIED INTEREST LOOPHOLE -- RATHER THAN NORMAL INCOME LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. I AM -- I HAVE CALLED FOR THE ENDING OF THAT LOOPHOLE SINCE 2007. I AM SICK OF MULTIMILLIONAIRES PAYING A LOWER TAX RATE THAN A TEACHER OR A NURSE. THAT IS WRONG. I WILL CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE --   AND I WILL REFORM OUR TAX CODE SO EVERYONE PAYS THEIR FAIR SHARE, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST BENEFITS. I HAVE PROPOSED INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN SMALL BUSINESSES, HARD HIT COMMUNITIES, AND ERODING OUR COUNTRY. NOT THE QUICK SPECULATION AND TRADING THAT GOES ON. I WANT TO SLEEP TAX CREDITS THAT WILL ENCOURAGE APPRENTICES AND PROFIT SHARING. I WANT YOUNG PEOPLE BROUGHT INTO OUR ECONOMY AGAIN, SO THEY HAVE THE CHANCE TO HAVE A BETTER FUTURE.   I WILL RAISE THEIR MINIMUM WAGE SO NO ONE WHO HAS TO LIVE IN AMERICA HAS TO LIVE IN POVERTY. I WILL FIGHT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT CREATE THE JOBS IN AMERICA.   WE ARE A SMALL BUSINESS COUNTRY. I WANT TO BE THE SMALL BUSINESS PRESIDENT. I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD BE CHILDREN OUR TAX CODE, OUR ECONOMIC POLICY, TOWARD BIG BUSINESSES THAT CAN HIRE LAWYERS AND LOBBYISTS. MOST JOBS IN AMERICA COME FROM SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT IS WHY I HAVE A PLAN TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR ENTREPRENEURS TO GET LOANS AND AVOID RED TAPE. I WILL HOLD CORPORATIONS AFFORDABLE -- ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY GOUGE DRUG PRICES OR EXPLOIT WORKERS.   AND THAT IS JUST THE BEGINNING. WE ARE GOING TO DO WHAT WORKS. BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT -- BECAUSE AS IMPORTANT AS ECONOMIC WORRIES ARE, THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT FAMILIES FACE TODAY, ARE THEY? IF YOU GET OUT THERE AND ACTUALLY LISTEN TO PEOPLE -- AS I HAVE DONE ALL OVER NEW HAMPSHIRE -- YOU HEAR ABOUT PROBLEMS THAT RARELY MAKE THE HEADLINES. BUT THAT KEEP FAMILIES UP AT NIGHT. I HAVE LISTENED TO THOSE STORIES. I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE HEART ACHES AND THE HOPES. IT REALLY HAS MOTIVATED ME TO ROLL UP MY SLEEVES TO, UP WITH SOLUTIONS THAT CAN HELP NAKED DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF FAMILIES HERE AND EVERYWHERE ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. FOR EXAMPLE, I NEVER EXPECTED THAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH WOULD BE MAJOR ISSUES IN MY CAMPAIGN UNTIL I CAME TO KEENE ON MY VERY FIRST TRIP. I HEARD STORY AFTER STORY ABOUT HEROINE, PILLS, METH, ALCOHOL. OTHER ADDICTIONS. I MET A GRANDMOTHER WHO IS TAKING US POSSIBILITY OF RAISING HER GRANDCHILD BECAUSE HER DAUGHTER IS STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. SHE CANNOT THE PARENT SHE SHOULD BE. I HAVE SAT AND LISTENED TO MOMS AND DADS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR CHILDREN. COUNSELORS AND DOCTORS AND POLICE OFFICERS WHO HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO HELP SAVE PEOPLE. ONE MAN IN LACONIA SAID TO ME THE OTHER DAY, ""I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO MORE FUNERALS."" WHEN YOU HEAR THOSE STORIES, IT IS HARD NOT ONLY TO BE MOVED AND SAID, BUT IT IS ALSO MOTIVATING. AT MY FIRST TOWN HALL ABOUT THIS ISSUE IN KEENE, HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE PACKED INTO THE GYMNASIUM. AND THEY TOLD THEIR STORIES. AND IN LACONIA JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, WE HEARD ABOUT SOLUTIONS. I HAVE GOT A PLAN TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS EPIDEMIC. MORE AND BETTER TREATMENT AND PREVENTION, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE WHO WRITES PRESCRIPTIONS IS TRAINED IN ADDICTION. PUTTING RESCUE DRUGS IN THE HANDS OF FIRST RESPONDERS.   CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM SO NONVIOLENT DRUG USERS HAVE TIME TO HEAL INSTEAD OF TIME IN JAIL.   THERE ARE SO MANY STORY IS THAT PEOPLE SHARE WITH ME. THAT IS WHAT DRIVES MY CAMPAIGN. THAT IS WHAT GETS ME UP EVERY DAY. OFTEN I AM ASKED, ""HOW DO CAN YOU DO THIS/"" WELL, IT IS CHALLENGING, BUT IT IS ALSO INCREDIBLY REWARDING. BECAUSE I MEET PEOPLE WHO ARE SO RESILIENT, SO FILLED WITH HOPE. I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT WHO TAKES ON THE BIG CHALLENGES. WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HOW WE MAKE SURE YOU WRONG NEVER GETS -- MAKE SURE YOU RUN -- MAKES SURE IRAN NEVER GETS A NUCLEAR WEAPON, BUT I ALSO WANT TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR CHALLENGES AS PRESIDENT. LIKE STUDENT DEBT. A STUDENT HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE --    A STUDENT REALLY SUMMED IT UP FOR ME, SAYING THAT PAYING FOR COLLEGE SHOULD NOT BE THE HARDEST THING ABOUT GOING TO COLLEGE. AND YESTERDAY, GOVERNOR HASSAN AND I WERE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHERE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MY PLAN. AND WHERE WE HEARD FROM TWO STUDENTS WHO VERY CLEARLY AND EMOTIONALLY TALKED ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE CHALLENGERS WERE. TRYING TO GET THE EDUCATION THEY HAVE ALWAYS DREAMED OF. I CALL MY PLAN THE NEW COLLEGE COMPACT. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL MAKE SURE FAMILIES CAN OF WARD TO SEND YOUR KIDS TO COLLEGE. EVERYONE WITH STUDENT DEBT CAN REFINANCE THAT DEBT, JUST LIKE A MORTGAGE OR A CAR LOAN.   COLLEGE WILL NOT BE A BARRIER ANYMORE IN DEBT WILL NOT HOLD ANYONE BACK. I ALSO HAVE TO SAY THAT I HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT ANOTHER CHALLENGE THAT GETS TOO LITTLE ATTENTION IN OUR LONG-TERM LOOKING FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE ABOUT WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WE ARE GOING TO BE AND HOW WE CAN HELP PEOPLE LIVE UP TO THEIR POTENTIAL. AND THAT IS THE CAREGIVING CRISIS IN AMERICA.   I MET A WOMAN IN DOVER, CARING FOR HER HUSBAND WITH ALZHEIMER'S, AND HER MOTHER WITH ALZHEIMER'S. I JUST MET A YOUNG MAN BACKSTAGE WHO HAS HAD TO GO TO PART-TIME WORK TO TAKE CARE OF HIS MOTHER WITH ALZHEIMER'S. PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO TURN. THEY DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO GET HELP. AS A SENATOR, I PASSED A LAW GIVING FAMILY CAREGIVERS MORE SUPPORT. AND AS PRESIDENT, I WILL MAKE THIS A NATIONAL PRIORITY FOR FAMILIES. NUMBER ONE.   EVERY ONE OF US KNOWS SOMEBODY WHO COULD BENEFIT. THE VETERANS, WHO DESERVE BETTER CARE.   THE PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM, WHO NEED HELP AND SOLUTIONS.   FAMILIES WHO CANNOT FIND FACILITIES TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FOR THEIR LOVED ONES, NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY TRY.   IT WAS SUMMED UP FOR ME BY A SINGLE MOM WHO IS JUGGLING A JOB AND COURSES AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHILE RAISING THREE KIDS ALONE. SHE SAID I DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING TO COME EASY. BUT SHE ASKED ME, ISN'T THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO SO IT IS NOT QUITE SO HARD? THESE ARE ALL CHALLENGES LEADERS SHOULD CARE ABOUT. PROBLEMS THAT DO NOT GET NEARLY ENOUGH ATTENTION ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL OR IN WASHINGTON. I AM NOT ONLY PAYING ATTENTION, AS PRESIDENT, WE WILL GET RESULTS TOGETHER. BECAUSE IF YOU WANT A PRESIDENT WHO WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG WITH AMERICA AND WHO IS TO BLAME FOR IT, YOU HAVE GOT PLENTY OF OTHER CHOICES.    AND, MY GOODNESS, DIDN'T WE HEAR ENOUGH OF THAT THE OTHER NIGHT AT THE REPUBLICAN DEBATE? BUT IF YOU WANT A PRESIDENT WHO WILL LISTEN TO YOU, WORK HER HEART OUT TO MAKE YOUR LIFE BETTER --  AND TOGETHER TO BUILD A STRONGER, FAIRER, BETTER COUNTRY, THEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT HER.    BECAUSE, YOU KNOW -- >> HILLARY! HILLARY!  THIS ELECTION, ULTIMATELY, IS ABOUT FINDING A LEADER WITH A VISION FOR THE FUTURE BROAD ENOUGH TO ENCOMPASS THIS GREAT COUNTRY OF OURS. AND THE SKILL AND DETERMINATION TO LEAD US THERE. SOMEONE WHO CAN DEFEND AND BUILD ON THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE, NOT LET IT SLIP AWAY OR GET RIPPED AWAY. I WILL STAND UP TO ALL THE ATTACKS FROM THE SUPER PACS AND  THE KOCH BROTHERS EVERY CHANCE I GET.   AND I WILL DO WHAT I HAVE ALWAYS DONE TO TRY TO OVERCOME THE DYSFUNCTION IN WASHINGTON. ACTUALLY TO GET THINGS DONE, LIKE I DID WHEN I WAS FIRST LADY. WE DID NOT GET HEALTH CARE THAT TIME. THEN I TURNED AROUND AND WORKED WITH TED KENNEDY TO GET THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE PROGRAM TO TAKE CARE OF MORE THAN 8 MILLION KIDS.   OR WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE, AND I REALIZED THAT OUR NATIONAL GUARD DID NOT HAVE THE SAME ACT AS TO HEALTH CARE, AND I TEAMED UP WITH LINDSEY GRAHAM AND WE PASSED IT. SO NOW EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR NATIONAL GUARD HAS THAT SAME OPTIONS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD BEFORE.   I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING MY WHOLE LIFE TO EVEN THE ODDS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE THOSE ODDS STACKED AGAINST THEM. THAT IS WHAT I AM GOING TO KEEP DOING. FIGHTING FOR FAMILIES, FIGHTING FOR FAIRNESS, FIGHTING FOR YOU. AND I HAVE LEARNED THROUGH A LOT OF EXPERIENCES. BUT I REALLY LEARNED IT FIRST FROM MY OWN MOTHER. ABANDONED AND MISTREATED BY HER FAMILY, SHE WAS OUT ON HER OWN AT 14, WORKING AS A HOUSEMAID. SHE CHANNELED HER HARDSHIPS INTO A DEEP COMMITMENT TO WORKING -- TO SERVING AND RESPECTING OTHERS. SHE HAS BEEN MY TOUCHSTONE, GUIDING ME THROUGH MY LIFE OF SERVICE. MY FIRST JOB OUT OF LAW SCHOOL WAS NOT AT SOME BIG NEW YORK LAW FIRM, IT WAS WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND, STANDING UP FOR KIDS.   EVERY STEP ALONG THE WAY, I HAVE STOOD UP FOR WOMEN, FOR CHILDREN, FOR FAMILIES, FOR UNDERDOGS. EVERYONE WHO NEEDS A CHAMPION. AND I AM JUST GETTING WARMED UP. I BELIEVE --    I BELIEVE IN AMERICA, BUT I BELIEVE IN AMERICA, WE SHOULD HAVE EACH OTHER'S BACKS. WE SHOULD LIFT EACH OTHER UP, NOT TEAR EACH OTHER DOWN. AND THAT IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN IT COMES TO LIFTING UP WOMEN, WHO DESERVE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK.   AND THAT MEANS, TOO, EVERY FAMILY DESERVES ACCESS TO QUALITY, AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY GO TO WORK.   EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO PAID FAMILY LEAVE, SO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A PAYCHECK AND TAKING CARE OF YOUR BABY OR YOUR MOM OR YOUR DAD.   I AM A PROUD DEMOCRAT, BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONES WHO STAND UP AND SAY THE PORTABLE -- WHO STAND UP AND SAY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS HERE TO STAY.   WE HAVE COME TOO FAR, FOUGHT TOO HARD, TO LET ANYONE TAKE IT AWAY. WE ARE THE ONES ALSO WHO UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TO MAKE SOCIAL SECURITY EVEN STRONGER. AND ESPECIALLY FOR WIDOWS, DIVORCED AND SINGLE WOMEN, WHO WERE THE POOREST SINGLE WOMEN IN AMERICA.   WE'RE THE ONES WHO SUPPORT TEACHERS, NOT SCAPEGOAT THEM.   WHO WILL INVEST IN UNIVERSITY -- WHO WILL INVEST IN UNIVERSAL PREKINDERGARTEN CHILDCARE SO ALL THE -- SO ALL OF US GET THE BEST START. IT IS TIME FOR US TO GET OVER THE TOXIC DEBATES ABOUT EDUCATION THAT HAVE PARALYZED US FOR TOO LONG. LET'S FOCUS ON WHAT ACTUALLY IS WORKS TO HELP TEACHERS TEACH AND CHILDREN LEARN.   AS PRESIDENT, I AM GOING TO ACTUALLY LISTEN TO TEACHERS AND LEARN WHAT THEY KNOW FROM BEING IN THOSE CLASSROOMS EVERY SINGLE DAY. I WILL FIGHT FOR STRONG PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN EVERY ZIP CODE AND COMMUNITY ACROSS AMERICA. AND I AM HONORED, I AM HONORED, TO HAVE EARNED THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE NEA RIGHT HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.   AND, DEMOCRATS BELIEVE WE DO NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT, COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE, AND GROWING OUR ECONOMY. WE CAN DO THAT BY EMBRACING CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY.   I WANT US TO SET BIG HOLES IN THIS COUNTRY AGAIN. I CAN REMEMBER -- I THINK THERE ARE A FEW OF YOU WHO CAN ALSO REMEMBER -- WHEN PRESIDENT KENNEDY CHALLENGED US TO SEND A MOON MISSION THAT WOULD LAND A MAN ON THE MOON AND BRING HIM BACK WITHIN A DECADE. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. NOBODY KNEW WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN I WAS SURE BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT SET THAT GOAL THAT AMERICA COULD GET IT DONE. AND WE DID. THAT IS THE KIND OF PRESIDENT I WANT TO BE. I WANT TO CHALLENGE US AGAIN, PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE AGAIN.   SO BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM, WE WILL HAVE INSTALLED HALF A BILLION MORE SOLAR PANELS. AND BY THE END OF MY SECOND, WE WILL PRODUCE ENOUGH RENEWABLE ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME IN AMERICA. HE CAN DO THIS -- WE CAN DO THIS. WE CAN TAKE ON CLIMATE CHANGE, NOT DENY IT. BUT TAKE IT ON. AND AT THE SAME TIME, CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS AND BUSINESSES THAT WILL MAKE AMERICA THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF THE 21ST CENTURY.   AND BOY, DEMOCRATS BELIEVE, AND WE ARE THE ONLY ONES LEFT WHO BELIEVE THIS, WE HAVE TO STOP THE FLOW OF SECRET UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY THAT DISTORTS OUR ELECTIONS AND DROWNS OUT THE VOICES OF AMERICAN VOTERS.   YOU KNOW, IT IS PREDICTED BY SOME THAT OUR NEXT PRESIDENT MAY HAVE AS MANY AS THREE APPOINTMENTS TO THE SUPREME COURT. NOW, IF YOU WERE NOT CONVINCED TO VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT BEFORE, I HOPE YOU ARE NOW. I WILL APPOINT JUSTICES WHO WILL PROTECT EVERY CITIZENS' RIGHT TO VOTE INCIDENT EVERY CORPORATION'S RIGHT TO ABIDE ELECTIONS -- TO BUY ELECTIONS.   AND IF NECESSARY, I WILL WORK TO PASS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO UNDO THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION IN CITIZENS UNITED.   AND WE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT, NO MATTER YOU ARE, WITH WHAT LOOK LIKE, WHAT A FEW PRACTICE, OR WHO YOU LOVE, AMERICA HAS A PLACE FOR YOU. AND YOU SHOULD HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY AS EVERYONE ELSE TO LIVE UP TO YOUR POTENTIAL. SO WE HAVE A GREAT AGENDA. WE KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A DEMOCRAT. WE WILL FIGHT THAT AGAINST THOSE WHO WILL DO, SAY, AND SPEND WHATEVER IT TAKES TO TURN OUR COUNTRY IN A VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION. WHO WATCH THE REPUBLICAN DEBATE THE OTHER NIGHT? OH, YOU GLUTTONS FOR PUNISHMENT, YOU. 15 CANDIDATES. FIVE HOURS. NOT A SINGLE FIGHTER FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. AND THE FACT CHECKERS ARE HAVING A FIELD DAY WITH THEIR ANSWERS. THE REPUBLICANS' POSITIONS ARE NOT JUST FACTUALLY INACCURATE, THEY ARE DEEPLY OUT OF TOUCH AND OUT OF DATE. NOT ONE OF THEM OFFER A CREDIBLE PLAN TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE OR COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE. DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT FAMILY LEAVE OR PRESCHOOL?  I AM GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING. I WILL FIGHT UNTIL EVERY WOMAN HAS THE RIGHTS, THE OPPORTUNITIES, AND THE RESPECT SHE DESERVES UNTIL EVERY LITTLE GIRL IN AMERICA KNOWS WITHOUT A DOUBT SHE CAN GROW UP TO BE ANYTHING SHE WANTS. EVEN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.   SO, MY FRIENDS, LET'S GO OUT AND WAGE THIS CAMPAIGN AND ELECT DEMOCRATS AT EVERY LEVEL. LET'S TAKE BACK SCHOOL BOARDS. LET'S TAKE THAT BE LEGISLATURES. LET'S TAKE BACK EVERY POSITION ALL THE WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE. BECAUSE IF THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT AMERICA'S FUTURE, NOT AMERICA'S FEAR, DEMOCRATS WILL WIN.   AND WHEN YOU HEAR MR. TRUMP SAYING HE WANTS TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, RESPOND AMERICA IS GREAT, WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE IT WORK FOR ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY AGAIN. SO, I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT CAMPAIGN. IT IS GOING TO BE FUN. BECAUSE WHAT MAKES THE OTHER FOLKS UNCOMFORTABLE IS WHAT MAKES AMERICA WHAT WE ARE TODAY. OUR DIVERSITY, OUR INGENUITY, OUR INNOVATION. THE SIGNS OF AMERICAN DYNAMISM. OUR IMMIGRANT CULTURE. ALL WE DO TO BUILD A COUNTRY WHERE EVERYBODY HAS A PLACE. WHERE THERE ARE NO LIMITS ON WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE WHEN WE PUT OUR, AND INTERESTS IN FRONT OF SELF INTERESTS AND COMMON SENSE IN FRONT OF NONSENSE. I AM FIGHTING OR THAT AMERICA. I AM FIGHTING FOR ALL AMERICANS, NOT JUST SOME. FOR THE STRUGGLING, THE STRIVING, AND THE SUCCESSFUL. I AM RUNNING FOR EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN KNOCKED DOWN BUT REFUSED TO BE KNOCKED OUT. I AM FIGHTING FOR YOU TO -- I AM FIGHTING FOR YOU, DEMOCRATS. LET'S GO OUT AND MAKE AMERICA THE FUTURE.    ",2015 New Hampshire Democratic Party State Convention

THANK YOU, AND ESPECIALLY TO YOU. THIS INSTITUTION HAS HOSTED MANY IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS OVER THE YEARS, AND I APPRECIATE HIS REFERENCE TO THE EVENT LAST NIGHT AND THE CONTINUING DIALOGUE ABOUT URGENT ISSUES FACING OUR NATION AND THE WORLD. THAT IS WHAT BRINGS ME HERE TODAY BACK TO BROOKINGS, TO TALK ABOUT THE QUESTION WE ARE ALL GRAPPLING WITH. HOW TO PREVENT IRAN FROM ACQUIRING A NUCLEAR WEAPON, AND MORE BROADLY, HOW TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND OUR ALLIES FROM THE FULL RANGE OF THREATS THAT IRAN POSES. THE STAKES ARE HIGH, AND THERE ARE NO SIMPLE OR PERFECTLY SATISFYING SOLUTIONS, SO THESE QUESTIONS, AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE MERITS OF THE NUCLEAR DEAL RECENTLY REACHED WITH IRAN, CAP PROVIDED PEOPLE WITH GOODWELL AND RAISED ISSUES ON BOTH SIDES. HERE IS HOW I SEE IT. EITHER WE MOVE FORWARD ON THE PATH OF DIPLOMACY AND SEES THIS CHANCE TO BLOCK I RAN A POSITIVE YES CHANCE FOR A NUCLEAR WEAPON, OR WE TURNED DOWN A MORE DANGEROUS PATH LEADING TO A FAR LESS CERTAIN AND RISKIER FUTURE. THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT THIS DEAL. I SUPPORT IT AS PART OF A LARGER STRATEGY TOWARDS IRAN. BY NOW, THE OUTCOME IN CONGRESS IS NO LONGER IN MUCH DOUBT, SO WE HAVE GOT TO START LOOKING AHEAD TO WHAT COMES NEXT, IN FORCING THE DEAL, DETERRING IRAN AND ITS PROXIES AND STRENGTHENING OUR ALLIES. THESE WILL BE MY GOALS AS PRESIDENT, AND TODAY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW I WOULD ACHIEVE THEM. LET ME START BY SAYING I UNDERSTAND THE SKEPTICISM SO MANY FEEL ABOUT IRAN. I, TOO, AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT IRANIAN AGGRESSION AND THE NEED TO CONFRONT IT. IT IS A WORTHLESS, BRUTAL REGIME THAT HAS THE BLOOD OF AMERICANS AND MANY OTHERS, INCLUDING ITS OWN PEOPLE, ON ITS HANDS. IT'S POLITICAL RALLIES RESOUND WITH CRIES OF DEATH TO AMERICA. ITS LEADERS TALK ABOUT WIPING ISRAEL OFF THE FACE OF THE MAP, MOST RECENTLY JUST YESTERDAY, AND FOMENT TERROR AGAINST IT. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO TRUST IRAN. NOW, VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY MIGHT HOPE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL SIMPLY FORGET, BUT THE TRUTH IS BY THE TIME PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK OFFICE AND I BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE, IRAN WAS RACING TOWARDS A NUCLEAR CAPABILITY. THEY HAD MASTERED THE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE, MEANING THAT THEY HAD THE MATERIAL, SCIENTISTS, AND TECHNICAL KNOW-HOW TO CREATE MATERIAL FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THEY HAD PRODUCED AND INSTALLED THOUSANDS OF CENTRIFUGES, EXPANDED THEIR SECRET FACILITIES, ESTABLISHED A ROBUST URANIUM ENRICHMENT PROGRAM, AND DEFIED THEIR INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY, AND THEY HAD NOT SUFFERED MANY CONSEQUENCES. I VOTED FOR SANCTIONS AGAIN AND AGAIN AS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK, BUT THEY WERE NOT HAVING MUCH EFFECT. MOST OF THE WORLD STILL DID BUSINESS WITH IRAN. WE NEEDED TO STEP UP OUR GAME, SO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I'VE PURSUED A TWO PRONGED STRATEGY. PRESSURE AND ENGAGEMENT. WE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE DOOR TO DIPLOMACY WAS OPEN IF IRAN ANSWERED THE CONCERNS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN A SERIOUS AND CREDIBLE WAY. WE SIMULTANEOUSLY LAUNCHED A COMPREHENSIVE CAMPAIGN TO SIGNIFICANTLY RAISE THE COST OF IRANIAN DEFIANCE. WE SYSTEMATICALLY INCREASED OUR MILITARY CAPABILITIES IN THE REGION, DEEPENING OUR COOPERATION WITH PARTNERS AND SENDING MORE FIREPOWER AND AN ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT CARRIER, BATTLESHIP, STRIKE AIRCRAFT, AND THE ADVANCED RADAR AND MISSILE SYSTEMS AVAILABLE. MEANWHILE, I TRAVELED THE WORLD CAPITAL BY CAPITAL, LEADER BY LEADER, TWISTING ARMS TO HELP BUILD THE GLOBAL COALITION THAT PRODUCED SOME OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE SANCTIONS IN HISTORY. WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LEADERSHIP, WE WORKED WITH CONGRESS AND THE EUROPEAN UNION TO CUT IRAN OFF FROM ITS FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM, AND ONE BY ONE, WE CONVINCED ENERGY HUNGRY CONSUMERS OF IRANIAN OIL TO CUT BACK. SOON, IRANIAN TANKERS SAT RUSTING IN SPORTS. ITS ECONOMY WAS COLLAPSING. THESE NEW MEASURES WERE INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE WE MADE THEM GLOBAL. AMERICAN SANCTIONS PROVIDED THE FOUNDATION, BUT I RANTED NOT REALLY FEEL THE HEAT UNTIL WE TURNED THIS INTO AN INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN. SO IRAN HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO NEGOTIATE. A COULD NO LONGER PLAY OFF ONE COUNTRY AGAINST ANOTHER. THEY HAD NO PLACE TO HIDE, SO THEY STARTED LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT. I FIRST AS IT DID TO SPEAK WITH THE SULTAN OF OMAN IN JANUARY 2011. I WENT BACK LATER THAT YEAR. HE HELPED TO UP A SECRET BACK CHANNEL. I SENT ONE OF MY CLOSEST AIDES TO BEGIN TALKS WITH THE IRANIANS IN SECRET NEGOTIATIONS BEGAN IN EARNEST AFTER THE IRANIAN ELECTION IN 2013. FIRST, THE BILATERAL TALKS LED BY THE DEPUTY SECRETARY AND JAKE SULLIVAN THAT LED TO THE INTERIM AGREEMENT, THEN THE MULTILATERAL TALKS, LED BY SECRETARY JOHN KERRY, AND UNDERSECRETARY WENDY SHERMAN AND OTHERS. NOW, THERE IS A COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM. IS IT GOOD? WELL, OF COURSE NOT. NO AGREEMENT LIKE THIS EVER IS, WHAT IS IT A STRONG AGREEMENT? YES, IT IS, AND WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT TURN IT DOWN. THE DEALS -- THE MERITS OF THE DEAL HAPPEN WILL DISCUSSED, SO I WILL NOT GO THROUGH THEM HERE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT ACCOMPLISHES THE SOLID GOALS WE WANTED TO ACHIEVE. IT CUTS OFF EVERY PATHWAY FOR IRAN TO GET A BOMB, AND IT GIVES US BETTER TOOLS FOR VERIFICATION AND INSPECTION AND TO COMPEL RIGOROUS COMPLIANCE. WITHOUT A DEAL, I RAN UP A SERIOUS BREAKOUT TIME, HOW LONG THEY NEED TO PRODUCE MATERIAL FOR A NUCLEAR WEAPON, WOULD SHRINK TO A COUPLE OF MONTHS. WITH A DEAL, THAT BREAKOUT TIME STRETCHES TO A YEAR, WHICH MEANS THAT IF IRAN CHEATS, WE WILL KNOW IT, AND WE WILL HAVE TIME TO RESPOND DECISIVELY. WITHOUT A DEAL, WE WOULD HAVE NO CREDIBLE INSPECTIONS OF I RAN UP US AS NUCLEAR FACILITIES. WITH A DEAL, WE WILL HAVE UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS. WE WILL BE ABLE TO MONITOR EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM. NOW, SOME HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT CERTAIN NUCLEAR RESTRICTIONS EXPIRE AFTER 15 YEARS, AND WE NEED TO BE VIGILANT ABOUT THAT, WHICH I WILL TALK MORE ABOUT IN A MOMENT, BUT OTHER PARTS ARE PERMANENT, INCLUDING IRAN'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE NONPROLIFERATION TREATY AND THEIR COMMITMENT TO ENHANCE INSPECTIONS UNDER THE ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL. OTHERS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT IT WOULD TAKE UP TO 24 DAYS TO GAIN ACCESS TO SOME OF IRAN'S FACILITIES WHEN WE ASK -- SUSPECT CHEATING. I WOULD BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT THIS PART OF THE DEAL IS NOT PERFECT. ALTHOUGH THE DEAL DOES ALLOW FOR DAILY ACCESS TO ENRICHMENT FACILITIES AND MONITORING OF THE ENTIRE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON THAT BECAUSE BEING ABLE TO MONITOR THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS CRITICAL TO WHAT WE WILL FIND OUT AND HOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO RESPOND. BUT OUR EXPERTS TELL US THAT EVEN WITH DELAYED ACCESS TO SOME PLACES, THIS DEAL DOES THE JOB. MICROSCOPIC NUCLEAR PARTICLES REMAIN FOR YEARS AND YEARS. THEY ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE. THAT IS WHY THE SECRETARY, A NUCLEAR PHYSICIST, IS CONFIDENT IN THIS PLAN, AND SOME HAVE SINCE JESTED THAT WE JUST GO BACK TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE AND GET A BETTER, UNSPECIFIED DEAL. I CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHY THAT MAY SOUND APPEALING, BUT AS SOMEONE WHO STARTED THESE TALKS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND HAS BUILT OUR GLOBAL COALITION PIECE BY PIECE, I CAN ASSURE YOU IT IS NOT REALISTIC. IF WE WALK AWAY NOW, OUR CAPACITY TO SUSTAIN AND ENFORCE THE SANCTIONS WILL BE SEVERELY DIMINISHED. WE WILL BE BLAMED, NOT THE IRANIANS. SO IF WE WERE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT, I RAN WILL BE POISED TO GET NEARLY EVERYTHING IT WANTS WITHOUT GIVING UP A THING. NO RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM. NO REAL WARNING IF TEHRAN SUDDENLY RUSHES TOWARDS A BOMB, AND THE INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS REGIME WOULD FALL APART. SO NO MORE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES FOR IRAN EITHER. THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN OUT THERE ON THE DIPLOMATIC FRONT LINES KNOW THAT DIPLOMACY IS NOT THE PURSUIT OF PERFECTION. IT IS THE BALANCING OF RISKS, AND ON BALANCE, THE FAR RISKIER COURSE RIGHT NOW WOULD BE TO WALK AWAY. GREAT POWERS CANNOT JUST EXPECT THE REST OF THE WORLD TO GO ALONG WITH US. WE NEED TO BE REASONABLE AND CONSISTENT, AND WE NEED TO KEEP OUR WORD, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO LEAD A COALITION. THAT IS HOW WE WILL MAKE THIS AND FUTURE DEALS WORK. BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUST SAY YES TO THIS DEAL. OF COURSE, IT ISN'T. WE HAVE TO SAY YES AND, YES AND WE WILL ENFORCE IT WITH VIGOR AND VIGILANCE. YES AND WE WILL EMBED IT IN A BROADER STRATEGY TO CONFRONT IRAN'S BAD BEHAVIOR IN THE REGION. YES, AND WE WILL BEGIN FROM DAY ONE TO SET THE CONDITIONS SO IRAN KNOWS IT WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON, NOT DURING THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT, NOT AFTER, NOT EVER. WE NEED TO BE CLEAR, AND I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR TO IRAN ABOUT WHAT WE EXPECT FROM THEM. THIS IS NOT THE START OF SOME LARGER DIPLOMATIC OPENING. AND WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT THAT THIS DEAL WILL LEAD TO BROADER CHANGES IN THEIR BEHAVIOR. THAT SHOULD NOT BE A PROMISE WE ARE PROCEEDING. INSTEAD, WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR THREE SCENARIOS. FIRST, IRAN TRIES TO CHEAT, SOMETHING IT HAS BEEN QUITE WILLING TO DO IN THE PAST. SECOND, I RAN TRIES TO WAIT US OUT, FOR 15 YEARS WHEN SOME BUT NOT ALL OF THE RESTRICTIONS EXPIRE, AND THIRD, IRAN RAMPS UP ITS DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR IN THE REGION, INCLUDING ITS SUPPORT OR TERROR GROUPS LIKE HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH. I BELIEVE THE SUCCESS OF THIS DEAL HAS A LOT TO DO WITH HOW THE NEXT PRESIDENT GRAPPLES WITH THESE CHALLENGES, SO LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I WOULD DO. MY STARTING POINT WILL BE ONE OF DISTANT TRUST. YOU REMEMBER PRESIDENT REAGAN'S LINE ABOUT THE SOVIETS. TRUST BUT VERIFY. MY APPROACH WOULD BE DISTRUST AND VERIFIED. WE SHOULD ANTICIPATE THAT IRAN WILL TEST THE NEXT PRESIDENT AREA THEY WILL WANT TO SEE HOW FAR THEY CAN BEND THE RULES. THAT WILL NOT WORK IF I'M IN THE WHITE HOUSE. I WILL HOLD THE LINE AGAINST IRANIAN NONCOMPLIANCE. THAT MEANS PENALTIES EVEN FOR SMALL VIOLATIONS. KEEPING OUR ALLIES ON BOARD AND BEING WILLING TO SNAP BACK SANCTIONS INTO PLACE UNILATERALLY IF WE HAVE TO. WORKING WITH CONGRESS TO CLOSE ANY GAPS IN THE SANCTIONS. RIGHT NOW, MEMBERS IN CONGRESS ARE OFFERING PROPOSALS TO THAT EFFECT, AND I THINK THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION SHOULD WORK WITH THEM TO SEE WHETHER THERE ARE ADDITIONAL STEPS THAT COULD BE TAKEN. FINALLY, IT MEANS ENSURING THAT THE IAEA HAS THE RESOURCES IT NEEDS FROM FINANCES TO PERSONNEL TO EQUIPMENT TO HOLD I RAN'S FEET TO THE FIRE, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO TO KEEP IRAN FROM CHEATING OR TRYING TO WAIT US OUT IS TO SHAPE IRANIAN EXPECTATIONS RIGHT FROM THE START. THE IRANIANS AND THE WORLD NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE WILL ACT DECISIVELY IF WE NEED TO. SO HERE IS MY MESSAGE TO IRAN'S LEADERS. THE UNITED STATES WILL NEVER ALLOW YOU TO ACQUIRE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL TAKE WHATEVER ACTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE UNITED STATES AND OUR ALLIES. I WILL NOT HESITATE TO TAKE MILITARY ACTION IF IRAN ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN A NUCLEAR WEAPON, AND I WILL SET UP MY SUCCESSOR TO BE ABLE TO CREDIBLY MAKE THAT SAME PLEDGE. WE WILL MAKE CLEAR TO IRAN THAT OUR NATIONAL COMMITMENT TO PREVENTION WILL NOT WAIVER DEPENDING ON WHO IS IN OFFICE. IT IS PERMANENT. AND SHOULD IT BECOME NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE, HAVING EXHAUSTED PEACEFUL ALTERNATIVES TO TURN TO MILITARY FORCE, WE WILL HAVE PRESERVED AND IN SOME CASES ENHANCED OUR CAPACITY TO ACT, AND BECAUSE WE HAVE PROVEN OUR COMMITMENT TO DIPLOMACY FIRST, THE WORLD WILL MORE LIKELY JOIN US. THEN THERE IS THE BROADER ISSUE OF COUNTERING IRAN'S BAD BEHAVIOR ACROSS THE REGION. TAKING NUCLEAR WEAPONS OUT OF THE EQUATION IS CRUCIAL. BECAUSE AN IRAN WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS SO MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THAN AN IRAN WITHOUT THEM. BUT EVEN WITHOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS, WE STILL SEE I RAN A POSITIVE FINGERPRINTS ON NEARLY EVERY CONFLICT ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY SUPPORT BAD ACTORS FROM SYRIA TO LEBANON TO YEMEN. THEY'VE FOUND TO DESTROY ISRAEL, AND THAT IS WORTH SAYING AGAIN. THEY VOWED TO DESTROY ISRAEL. WE CANNOT EVER TAKE THAT LIGHTLY, PARTICULARLY WHEN I RAN SHIPS ADVANCED MISSILES TO HEZBOLLAH, AND THE AYATOLLAH OUTLINES AN ACTUAL STRATEGY FOR ELIMINATING ISRAEL. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW ISRAEL WILL NOT EXIST IN 25 YEARS, JUST LIKE HE DID TODAY, AND IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THE MALICIOUS ACTIVITY THEY ALREADY UNDERWRITE, WE HAVE GOT TO ANTICIPATE THAT IRAN COULD USE SOME OF THE ECONOMIC RELIEF THEY GET FROM   THIS DEAL TO PAY FOR EVEN MORE. SO AS PRESIDENT I WILL RAISE THE COSTS FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND CONFRONT THEM ACROSS THE BOARD. MY STRATEGY WILL BE BASED ON FIVE STRONG PILLARS. FIRST, I WILL DEEPEN AMERICA'S UNSHAKABLE COMMITMENT TO ISRAEL'S SECURITY. INCLUDING OUR LONG-STANDING TRADITION OF GUARANTEEING ISRAEL'S QUALITATIVE MILITARY EDGE. I'LL INCREASE SUPPORT FOR ISRAELI ROCKET AND MISSILE DEFENSES AND FOR INTELLIGENCE SHARING. I'LL SELL ISRAEL THE MOST SOPHISTICATED FIRE AIRCRAFT EVER DEVELOPED, THE F-35. WE'LL WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT BETTER TUNNEL DETECTION TECHNOLOGY TO PREVENT ARMS SMUGGLING AND KIDNAPPING. AS WELL AS THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM FOR NORTHERN ISRAEL WHICH HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO HEZBOLLAH ATTACKS FOR YEARS. SECOND, I WILL REAFFIRM THAT THE PERSIAN GULF IS A REGION OF VITAL INTEREST TO THE UNITED STATES. WE DON'T WANT ANY OF IRAN'S NEIGHBORS TO DEVELOP OR ACQUIRE A NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM EITHER. WE WANT THEM TO FEEL AND BE SECURE. I WILL SUSTAIN A ROBUST MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE REGION, ESPECIALLY OUR AIR AND NAVAL FORCES. WE'LL KEEP THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ OPEN. WE'LL INCREASE SECURITY COOPERATION WITH OUR GULF ALLIES, INCLUDING AGAINST INTELLIGENCE SHARING, MILITARY SUPPORT, AND MISSILE DEFENSE. TO ENSURE THEY CAN DEFEND AGAINST IRANIAN AGGRESSION. EVEN IF THAT TAKES THE FORM OF CYBERATTACKS OR OTHER NONTRADITIONAL THREATS. IRAN SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE UNITED STATES AND I AS PRESIDENT WILL NOT STAND BY AS OUR GULF ALLIES AND PARTNERS ARE THREATENED. WE WILL ACT. THIRD, I WILL BUILD A COALITION TO COUNTER IRAN'S PROXIES, PARTICULARLY HEZBOLLAH. THAT MEANS ENFORCING AND STRENGTHENING THE RULES PROHIBITING THE TRANSFER OF WEAPONS TO HEZBOLLAH. LOOKING AT NEW WAYS TO CHOKE OFF THEIR FUNDING AND PRESSING OUR PARTNERS TO TREAT HEZBOLLAH AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IT IS . IT'S TIME TO ELIMINATE THE FALSE DISTINCTION THAT SOME STILL MAKE BETWEEN THE SUPPOSED POLITICAL AND MILITARY WINGS. IF YOU'RE PART OF HEZBOLLAH, YOU'RE PART OF A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, PLAIN AND SEVERAL. -- PLAIN AND SIMPLE. BEYOND HEZBOLLAH I'LL CRACK DOWN ON THE SHIPMENT OF WEAPONS TO HAMAS AND PUSH TURKEY AND QATAR TO END THEIR FINANCIAL SUPPORT. I'LL PRESS OUR PARTNERS IN THE REGION TO PREVENT AIRCRAFT AND SHIPS OWNED BY COMPANIES LINKED TO IRAN'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARD FROM ENTERING THEIR TERRITORIES AND URGE OUR PARTNERS TO BLOCK IRANIAN PLANES FROM ENTERING THEIR AIRSPACE ON THEIR WAY TO YEMEN AND SYRIA. ACROSS THE BOARD, I WILL VIGOROUSLY ENFORCE AND STRENGTHEN, IF NECESSARY, THE AMERICAN SANCTIONS ON IRAN AND ITS REVOLUTIONARY GUARD FOR ITS SPONSORSHIP OF TERRORISM, ITS BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAM, AND OTHER DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES. I'LL ENFORCE AND STRENGTHEN IF NECESSARY OUR RESTRICTIONS ON SENDING ARMS TO IRAN AND FROM IRAN TO BAD ACTORS LIKE SYRIA. AND I'LL IMPOSE THESE SANCTIONS ON EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THESE ACTIVITIES, WHETHER THEY ARE IN IRAN OR OVERSEAS. THIS WILL BE A SPECIAL IMPERATIVE AS SOME OF THE U.N. SANCTIONS LAPSE. SO THE U.S. AND OUR PARTNERS HAVE TO STEP UP. FOURTH, I'LL STAND AS I ALWAYS HAVE AGAINST IRAN'S ABUSES AT HOME FROM ITS DETENTION OF POLITICAL PRISONERS TO ITS CRACKDOWN ON FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, INCLUDING ONLINE. ITS INHUMANE POLICIES HOLD BACK TALENTED AND SPIRITED PEOPLE. OUR QUARREL IS NOT AND NEVER HAS BEEN WITH THE IRANIAN PEOPLE. THEY HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE. A HOPEFUL FUTURE. IF THEY WEREN'T HELD BACK BY THEIR LEADERS. AS I SAID BEFORE, I THINK WE WERE TOO RESTRAINED IN OUR SUPPORT OF THE PROTESTS IN JUNE, 2009, AND IN OUR CONDEMNATION OF THE GOVERNMENT CRACKDOWN THAT FOLLOWED. THAT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. WE WILL ENFORCE AND IF NEED BE BROADEN OUR HUMAN RIGHTS SANCTIONS, AND I WILL NOT REST UNTIL EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN DETAINED OR MISSING IN IRAN IS HOME. FIFTH, JUST AS THE NUCLEAR AGREEMENT NEEDS TO BE EMBEDDED IN A BROADER IRAN POLICY, OUR BROADER IRAN POLICY NEEDS TO BE EMBEDDED IN A COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL STRATEGY THAT PROMOTES STABILITY AND COUNTERS EXTREMISM. IRAN, LIKE ISIS, BENEFITS FROM CHAOS AND STRIFE. IT EXPLOITS OTHER COUNTRIES' WEAKNESSES AND THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST IRAN ARE THE COUNTRIES AND GOVERNMENTS BEING STRONG SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE SECURITY AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY TO THEIR OWN PEOPLE, AND THEY MUST HAVE THE TOOLS TO PUSH BACK ON RADICALIZATION AND EXTREMISM. HELPING COUNTRIES GET THERE WILL TAKE TIME AND STRATEGIC DISCIPLINE, BUT IT'S CRUCIAL THAT THE UNITED STATES LEADS THIS EFFORT. I WILL PUSH FOR RENEWED DIPLOMACY TO SOLVE THE DESTRUCTIVE REGIONAL CONFLICTS THAT IRAN FUELS. WE HAVE TO BRING SUFFICIENT PRESSURE ON ASSAD TO FORCE A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN SYRIA. INCLUDING A MEANINGFUL INCREASE IN OUR EFFORTS TO TRAIN AND EQUIP THE MODERATE SYRIAN OPPOSITION, SOMETHING I CALLED FOR EARLY IN THE CONFLICT. AND THE UNITED STATES MUST LEAD IN ASSISTING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN UPROOTED BY CONFLICT, ESPECIALLY THE MILLIONS OF SYRIAN REFUGEES NOW BESEECHING THE WORLD TO HELP THEM. AS POPE FRANCIS REMINDED US, THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM THAT DEMANDS AN INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE. AND THE UNITED STATES MUST HELP LEAD THAT RESPONSE. THAT'S WHO WE ARE, AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO. SO OUR STRATEGY NEEDS TO COVER ALL THESE BASES. IRAN'S NUCLEAR AMBITIONS AND ITS SUPPORT OF TERRORISM. ITS HATRED OF ISRAEL AND ITS CRUELTY TOWARD ITS CITIZENS. ITS MILITARY RESOURCES AND ITS ECONOMIC STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. WE NEED TO BE CREATIVE, COMMITTED, AND VIGILANT. AND ON EVERY FRONT, WE NEED TO KEEP WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR FRIENDS AND PARTNERS. ON THAT NOTE, LET ME JUST SPEND A MINUTE SPEAKING ABOUT THE SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT ISRAEL LEADERS HAVE ABOUT THIS DEAL. ISRAEL HAS EVERY REASON TO BE ALARMED BY A REGIME THAT BOTH DENIES ITS EXISTENCE AND SEEKS ITS DESTRUCTION. I WOULD NOT SUPPORT THIS AGREEMENT FOR ONE SECOND IF I THOUGHT IT PUT ISRAEL IN GREATER DANGER. I BELIEVE IN MY CORE THAT ISRAEL AND AMERICA MUST STAND SIDE BY SIDE, AND I WILL ALWAYS STAND BY ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF AS I ALWAYS HAVE. I BELIEVE THIS DEAL AND A JOINT STRATEGY FOR ENFORCING IT MAKES ISRAEL SAFER. I SAY THAT WITH HUMILITY. I AM NOT ISRAELI. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE UNDER CONSTANT THREAT FROM YOUR NEIGHBORS IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE MARGIN FOR ERROR IS SO THIN. I KNOW THAT MY SAYING THIS DEAL MAKES YOU SAFER WON'T ALLEVIATE THE VERY REAL FEARS OF THE ISRAELI PEOPLE, BUT I HAVE STOOD FOR ISRAELI SECURITY FOR A VERY LONG TIME. IT WAS ONE OF MY BEDROCK PRINCIPLES AS SECRETARY OF STATE. IT'S WHY I SUPPORTED STRONGER DEFENSE SYSTEMS LIKE THE IRON DOME ANTI-ROCKET DEFENSE SYSTEM WHICH PROVED SO EFFECTIVE IN PROTECTING ISRAELI LIVES DURING THE CONFLICTS OF 2012 AND LAST SUMMER. IT'S WHY I WORKED CLOSELY WITH ISRAEL TO ADVANCE THE TWO-STATE VISION OF A JEWISH AND DEMOCRATIC ISRAEL WITH SECURE AND RECOGNIZED BORDERS, AND IT'S WHY I BELIEVE WE SHOULD EXPEDITED NEGOTIATIONS WITH ISRAEL. LET'S NOT WAIT UNTIL 2016 UNTIL THE -- WHEN THE CURRENT DEAL EXPIRES. LET'S GET IT DONE THIS YEAR. I WOULD INVITE THE PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL DURING MY FIRST MONTH IN OFFICE TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THESE ISSUES AND TO SET US ON A COURSE OF CLOSE, FREQUENT CONSULTATION RIGHT FROM THE START. BECAUSE WE BOTH RELY ON EACH OTHER FOR SUPPORT AS PARTNERS, ALLIES AND FRIENDS. THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT POLICY FOR ME. IT IS PERSONAL. AS PRESIDENT, I'M COMMITTED TO SHORING UP AND STRENGTHENING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES. WE HAVE HAD HONEST DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT THIS DEAL. NOW IS THE TIME TO COME TOGETHER. NOW IS THE TIME TO REMEMBER WHAT UNITES US AND BUILD UPON IT IT. AND SO, I KNOW WELL THAT THE SAME FORCES THAT THREATEN ISRAEL, THREATENS THE UNITED STATES, AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL, LET ME SAY YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO QUESTION WHETHER WE'RE WITH YOU. THE UNITED STATES WILL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN HONEST DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT THE NUCLEAR DEAL HERE AT HOME. SMART, SERIOUS PEOPLE CAN SEE ISSUES LIKE THESE DIFFERENTLY. LIKE MY FRIEND, CHUCK SHUMER, WHO IS GOING TO BE AN EXCELLENT LEADER IN THE SENATE. I RESPECT THE SKEPTICISM THAT HE AND OTHERS FEEL, AND I RESPECT DIFFERENCES OF OPINION AND PEOPLE WHO ADVOCATE VIGOROUSLY FOR THEIR BELIEFS. BUT I HAVE A HARDER TIME RESPECTING THOSE WHO APPROACH AN ISSUE AS SERIOUS AS THIS WITH UNSERIOUS TALK, ESPECIALLY ANYONE RUNNING TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SEVERAL REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES BOAST THEY'LL TEAR UP THIS AGREEMENT IN 2017, MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER IT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED. THAT'S NOT LEADERSHIP. THAT'S RECKLESSNESS. IT WOULD SET US RIGHT DOWN THE VERY DANGEROUS PATH WE'VE WORKED SO HARD TO AVOID. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO A ROBUST DEBATE ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY IN THIS CAMPAIGN. WHERE WE HAVE DISAGREEMENTS WE SHOULD LAY THEM OUT. LIKE AMERICAN GROUND FORCES IN IRAQ SHOULD ENGAGE IN DIRECT COMBAT, AS SCOTT WALKER WANTS. OR IF WE SHOULD KEEP CUBA CLOSED, AS MARCO RUBIO AND JEB BUSH WANTS. LET'S DEBATE THESE ISSUES BUT LET'S DEBATE THEM ON FACTS, NOT FEAR. LET'S RESIST DENIGRATING THE PATRIOTISM OR LOYALTY OF THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH US, AND LET'S AVOID AT ALL COSTS UNDERMINING AMERICA'S CREDIBILITY ABROAD. THAT ONLY MAKES US WEAKER, AND I'M GOING TO CALL IT OUT WHENEVER I SEE IT. I SPENT FOUR YEARS REPRESENTING AMERICA ABROAD AS AMERICA'S SECRETARY OF STATE. IT WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST PRIVILEGES OF MY LIFE, AND KNOWING THAT MY FELLOW AMERICANS WERE COUNTING ON ME AND ROOTING FOR ME, NOT AS DEMOCRATS, NOT AS REPUBLICANS BUT AS AMERICANS, MEANT A GREAT DEAL. WE ARE ALL ONE TEAM. THE AMERICAN TEAM. AND THAT DOESN'T CHANGE NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE MIGHT DISAGREE. AND I CAN TELL YOU FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WE ARE STRONGER OVERSEAS WHEN WE ARE UNITED AT HOME. SO WE SIMPLY HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO WORK TOGETHER BETTER THAN WE HAVE BEEN DOING. THERE'S A LOT THAT DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS CAN AND SHOULD AGREE ON. THE UNITED STATES SHOULD LEAD IN THE MIDDLE EAST. WE CAN AGREE ON THAT. WE SHOULD STAND BY OUR FRIENDS AGAINST IRANIAN AGGRESSION. WE CAN AGREE ON THAT TOO. I BELIEVE THAT THE PLAN I'VE LAID OUT TODAY IS ONE THAT ALL AMERICANS COULD ENDORSE, AND I HOPE THEY WILL. THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL FACE THREATS FROM MANY CORRIDORS. FROM THOSE WE SEE TODAY LIKE TERRORISM FROM ISIS, AGGRESSIVENESS FROM PUTIN, PANDEMICS LIKE EBOLA TO ALL THOSE WE CAN'T PREDICT YET. WE NEED A LEADER WHO HAS A STRONG VISION FOR THE FUTURE AND SKILL AND DETERMINATION TO GET US THERE. WE CAN'T STOP THE WORLD FROM CHANGING, BUT WE CAN HELP TO SHAPE THOSE CHANGES, AND WE CAN DO THAT BY LEADING WITH STRENGTH, SMARTS AND UNYIELDING COMMITMENT TO OUR VALUES. YOU KNOW, I SAW THAT WHEN I WAS FIRST LADY, SENATOR, SECRETARY OF STATE THAT WHEN AMERICA LEADS WITH PRINCIPLE AND PURPOSE, OTHER PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENTS ARE EAGER TO JOIN US. NO COUNTRY COMES CLOSE TO MATCHING OUR ADVANTAGES, THE STRENGTH OF OUR ECONOMY, THE SKILL OF OUR WORK FORCE, OUR TRADITION OF INNOVATION, OUR UNMATCHED NET WORTH OF ALLIANCES AND PARTNERSHIPS. SO WE ARE POISED TO REMAIN THE WORLD'S MOST ADMIRED AND POWERFUL NATION FOR A LONG TIME IF WE MAKE THE SMART CHOICES AND , PRACTICE SMART LEADERSHIP. THAT'S WHAT I WILL TRY TO DO AS YOUR PRESIDENT, AND I BELIEVE AS STRONGLY AS EVER THAT OUR BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US AND THAT AMERICA'S GREATEST CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WORLD ARE YET TO COME. THANK YOU, ALL, VERY MUCH.   I BELIEVE THAT IRAN IS THE SUBJECT OF THE AGREEMENT. THAT IT NOW FACES OBLIGATIONS THAT FRANKLY IN MANY INSTANCES IT FACED BEFORE THE AGREEMENT AND THAT THEY HAVE A -- SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WHERE THEY ARE COMMITTING THEMSELVES TO FULFILL THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT. THE AGREEMENT WILL BE ENFORCED, NOT BY IRAN. THE AGREEMENT WILL BE ENFORCED BY THE REST OF THE NEGOTIATORS, THE OTHER COUNTRIES PLUS THE IAEA AND IT WILL BE AND IS INTENDED TO BE QUITE BURDENSOME AND INTRUSIVE INTO IRAN. NOW, MAYBE THEY BELIEVE THAT HAVING SIGNED THE AGREEMENT THEY CAN SOMEHOW AVOID THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE INSPECTIONS AND THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS, BUT I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND VERY WELL THEY'RE AT THE STARTING LINE. THERE ARE THESE DEMANDS THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO FULFILL. THERE IS A SEQUENCING OF LIFTING OF SANCTIONS AND OTHER KINDS OF BENEFITS THAT THEY RECEIVE IN RETURN FOR THEIR HAVING TAKEN THE ACTION REQUIRED. I THINK IF THEY ARE COUNTING ON THE WORLD LED BY THE UNITED STATES BEING DISTRACTED, GETTING DIVERTED, GETTING TIRED, NOT HAVING THE STAYING POWER TO CONSISTENTLY ENFORCE THE AGREEMENT AND HOLD IRAN ACCOUNTABLE AND I FOR ONE WANT TO MAKE CLEAR TO THEM THAT THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, THAT WE WILL TAKE SERIOUSLY EVERY ASPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND WE WILL EXPECT THEM TO COMPLY AND THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES IF THEY DO NOT.  WELL, YOU KNOW, MARTIN, IT'S NOT IRAN THAT WE'RE INVESTED, IT'S NOW BECOMING PUBLIC, WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT RUSSIAN INVESTMENT, RUSSIAN TROOPS ON THE GROUND. IT MAY VERY WELL BE OPENING THE DOOR TO GREATER RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT RUSSIA HAS BEEN A PRINCIPAL FUNDER AND SUPPLIER THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE TERRIBLE EPISODE. SO WE ARE FACING THE COLLAPSE OF SYRIA, THE SURVIVAL THUS FAR OF THE ASSAD REGIME, ALTHOUGH IT CLEARLY HAS MUCH LESS TO GOVERN THAN IT DID WHEN THIS STARTED. THE OPEN, UNGOVERNED AREAS THAT ARE HOSTING TERRORIST GROUPS AND THE CONTINUING COMMITMENT FROM IRAN AND RUSSIA TO PROPPING UP ASSAD. SO I WAS THE PRINCIPAL NEGOTIATOR ON THE GENEVA 2012 AGREEMENT WHICH RUSSIA SIGNED ONTO, WHICH LAID OUT A PATHWAY TO A POLITICAL SOLUTION. IT WASN'T VERY LONG UNTIL RUSSIA RENEGED ON WHAT THEY HAD SIGNED, BUT I THINK IT STILL PROVIDES A VERY CREDIBLE FRAMEWORK FOR US TO KEEP DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO, YOU KNOW, TRY TO PUSH THE IRANIANS AND THE RUSSIANS IN THAT DIRECTION. NOW, WHAT I DO BELIEVE IS THIS. YOU KNOW, THE POTENTIAL THREAT FROM THE TERRORIST GROUPS AND THE CHAOS IN SYRIA CAN DESTABILIZE THE REGION IN WAYS THAT ARE BAD FOR IRAN, AND THEREFORE, THE HIGHER THE PRESSURE IS FOR SOME KIND OF REACTION TO WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE SYRIA AND CERTAINLY THE EFFORTS THAT ISIS IS MAKING TO TAKE EVEN MORE AND HOLD TERRITORY IN IRAQ DIRECTLY AGAINST WHAT IRAN SEES AS ITS INTERESTS, THE CONTINUED DESTABILIZATION ALONG THE LEBANESE BORDER, THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF REASONS WHY IRAN IS GOING TO HAVE TO CONFRONT THIS INSTABILITY. SO I THINK MY VIEW ON THIS IS WE HAVE TO BE, YOU KNOW, TALKING AND PUSHING ON AND RAISING THE COSTS FOR IRAN AND FOR RUSSIA ALL THE TIME. NOW, IF PUTIN WERE SITTING HERE, WHICH IT'S SORT OF HARD TO IMAGINE, BUT IF HE WERE -- I SHOULD ASK STROBE. STROBE IS THE EXPERT. HE WOULD SAY, WE'RE FIGHTING TERRORISM, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. SO WE MAY FIND A WAY TO BEGIN TO JOIN THOSE --  WELL, YOU KNOW VERY WELL IT'S A DIFFICULT ONE. I APOLOGIZE FOR MY VOICE. SUFFERING UNDER MASSIVE ALLERGY ASSAULT. YES REPUBLICAN HISTAMINES ARE , EVERYWHERE.  YOU KNOW, MARTIN, THIS SOMEONE -- THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE FACE. NO ONE CAN DENY MUCH OF THE EXTREMISM IN THE WORLD IS THE DIRECT RESULT OF POLICIES AND FUNDING UNDERTAKEN BY THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT AND INDIVIDUALS. WE WOULD BE FOOLISH NOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT. I THINK INCREASINGLY THEY WOULD BE MISTAKEN NOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT. YOU CAN NEVER BE MORE EXTREME THAN THE NEXT EXTREMIST, AND I THINK THEY FACE SOME VERY SERIOUS INTERNAL PROBLEMS, AS DO THE OTHER REGIMES. I'M NOT SURE THEY'RE YET CONVINCED OF THAT. I'M NOT SURE THEY YET BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT DIFFERENT WAYS OF DEALING WITH THEIR OWN POPULATION AND COOPERATING WITH EACH OTHER. AND CUTTING OFF FUNDING AND EXPORTING, YOU KNOW, TROUBLESOME IMAMS TO ELSEWHERE, BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO BE CONSTANTLY BEATING THAT DRUM WITH THEM. AND MAYBE NOW GIVEN THE RISE OF ISIS AND THE VERY CLEAR THREAT THEY FEEL FROM IRANIAN ACTIVITIES IN THE GULF THAT MAYBE THERE'S AN OPENNESS THERE. I KNOW THAT THE KING WAS HERE LAST WEEK, HAD A CHANCE TO MEET WITH THE PRESIDENT, SO PERHAPS THERE'S MORE OF AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A DIALOGUE THAN WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST. HOWEVER, HAVING SAID THAT, I THINK WE NEED TO DO TO DEFEND THEM BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVES ARE HARDLY MORE PROMISING.  OR ANY PRIME MINISTER.  WELL, I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF ROOM FOR TOUGH LOVE, PARTICULARLY IN PRIVATE AND BEHIND, YOU KNOW, CLOSED DOORS. AS I WRITE IN MY BOOK, CERTAINLY PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU AND I HAD VERY VIGOROUS CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE GONE ON IN PERSON AND OVER THE PHONE. BUT I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A PARTICULARLY PRODUCTIVE APPROACH FOR THE UNITED STATES TO TAKE BECAUSE IN LARGE MEASURE IT OPENS THE DOOR TO EVERYBODY ELSE TO DELEGITIMIZE ISRAEL, TO PILE ON IN WAYS THAT ARE NOT GOOD FOR THE STRENGTH AND STABILITY, NOT JUST OF ISRAEL, OBVIOUSLY, BUT OF THE REGION. AND SO IN THE ABSENCE OF, YOU KNOW, SOME KIND OF GREATER GOAL THAT WE WERE TRYING TO ACHIEVE BY DOING THAT, I JUST DON'T THINK THAT IS THE SMARTEST APPROACH.  YES, I WOULD, ROBIN. BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE TO ATTEMPT TO DO THAT. WHEN I FIRST WENT TO OMAN IN JANUARY OF 2011, WE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER ANY EFFORT AT SOME KIND OF SECRET CHANNEL WOULD PAY OFF. WE STILL HAVE THE P-5 PLUS 1 THAT WAS GOING ON. AND WE KNEW THAT EVENTUALLY WHATEVER THE UNITED STATES DID WOULD HAVE TO MERGE INTO THE INTERNATIONAL APPROACH. BUT WE HAD TO BEGIN TO EXPLORE IF AND WE DID. AND WE EXPLORED IT OVER THAT SUMMER. THAT'S WHEN WE HAD THE FIRST, YOU KNOW, VISIT TO DISCUSS WHETHER ANYTHING COULD BE POSSIBLE. IT TAKES A WHILE, AS YOU KNOW SO WELL, BEING SUCH AN EXPERT IN THIS REGION, TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S AT THE TABLE, WHAT THE CONVERSATION'S ABOUT, HOW SERIOUSLY YOU'LL BE TAKEN, WHO'S BACKING YOU UP. SO WHEN THE TALKS ACTUALLY STARTED JUST IN THE IRANIAN-AMERICAN CHANNEL WITH BILL BYRNES AND JAKE SULLIVAN AND BOB EINHORN, IT WAS EXPLORATORY AND LAID DOWN THE GROUND RULES WE WERE LOOKING FOR AND THEN EVENTUALLY WAS LAUNCHED INTO THE P-5 PLUS 1 ONCE THERE WAS A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT IN IRAN AND THERE WAS SERIOUS EFFORT. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER ISSUES, I HAVE VERY CLEARLY IN THE PUBLIC ARENA SEEN THE IRANIANS AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS REJECT ANY SUCH DISCUSSION. THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT YEMEN. THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE NUCLEAR AGREEMENT. NOW, THAT WAS A STRATEGIC DECISION WE MADE BACK THEN. YOU KNOW, NUMBER ONE, IT APPEARED TO US IN THE EARLY DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROCEED, THEY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING AS A WAY TO GET SOME ITEMS ON THE TABLE TO TRADE OFF FOR THE NUCLEAR AGREEMENTS SO THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO MAKE PERHAPS AS MANY CONCESSIONS AS WE WERE EXPECTING THEM TO MAKE. THAT'S WHY WE KEPT VERY FOCUS ON JUST THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM. WE ALSO HAD THE CONTINUING CHALLENGE, AND IT WOULD BE, EVEN IN THIS INSTANCE, OF OUR FRIENDS IN THE GULF NOT WANTING US TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING THAT AFFECTED THEM IN A BILATERAL CHANNEL WITH THE IRANIANS. AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY. IF THEY WEREN'T GOING TO BE AT THE TABLE, THEY DIDN'T WANT THE UNITED STATES TO BE TALKING ABOUT YEMEN OR TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE OF VITAL INTEREST IN THEIR VIEWS TO THEM. SO IF THERE WERE A WAY TO CONSTRUCT SUCH A CHANNEL, I WOULD BE OPEN TO IT BUT I'M JUST LAYING OUT SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF US BEING ABLE TO TO DO THAT ON THIS SWEET OF -- SUITE OF OTHER ISSUES THAT TOUCHES MANY OF THE REGIONS OF VITAL INTEREST. AND I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO SYRIA, WE HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT WANTED TO TALK TO IRAN ABOUT SYRIA BECAUSE WE KNEW IRAN WAS BASICALLY THE PRINCIPAL SUPPORTER, PROPPER UP, IF YOU WILL, OF ASSAD AND WE WANTED TO GET THE REST OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN HARNESS TO HAVE A SET OF EXPECTATIONS AND DEMANDS BEFORE WE BROUGHT IRAN IN. SO WE HAVE TO READJUST THIS ALL THE TIME. JUST AS I SAID DIPLOMACY IS A BALANCING OF RISK, IT'S ALSO THE CONSTANT EVALUATION OF WHERE THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE, WHERE THE OPENINGS ARE, WHAT POSSIBLY COULD HAPPEN NOW THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN BEFORE. SO I'M OPEN BUT I AM VERY SOBER ABOUT HOW IT WOULD HAVE TO BE CONSTRUCTED AND WHAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY COVER AND WHO WOULD HAVE TO BE EITHER AT THE TABLE OR, YOU KNOW, IN THE FIRST CHAIR BEHIND SO THEY DIDN'T FEEL THAT THEY WERE BEING LEFT OUT OR NEGOTIATED OVER.  WELL, IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD HEAR THE QUESTION BUT IT WAS, YOU KNOW, AIMED AT WHAT YOU COULD DO TO UP THE COST ON RUSSIA, FOR EXAMPLE, TO BE A MORE PRODUCTIVE PARTNER IN SEEKING A SOLUTION AND HOW WOULD WE DO MORE TO, AS I UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU SAID, YOU KNOW, WORK WITH OUR EUROPEAN PARTNERS ON THE SECURITY ISSUES THAT ARE CHALLENGING EUROPE AND WE SEE THAT EVERY DAY WITH THE AND WE SEE THAT EVERY DAY WITH THE REFUGEES BECAUSE IT'S HUMANITARIAN BUT IT'S ALSO A SECURITY CHALLENGE AS WELL. WELL, I HAVE BEEN, I REMAIN CONVINCED THAT WE NEED A CONCERTED EFFORT TO REALLY UP THE COST ON RUSSIA AND IN PARTICULAR ON PUTIN. I THINK WE HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH. I AM IN THE CATEGORY OF PEOPLE WHO WANTED US TO DO MORE IN RESPONSE TO THE ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA AND THE CONTINUING DESTABILIZATION OF UKRAINE. I UNDERSTAND THE HESITATION, NOT ONLY IN OUR COUNTRY, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IN EUROPE. THE SANCTIONS CAME OUT OF ALL OF THE DISCUSSIONS AND, YOU KNOW, MAYBE TO SOME EXTENT THEY HAVE HAD, YOU KNOW, SOME IMPACT. I THINK THE FALLING OIL PRICES HAVE HAD MORE IMPACT AND WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE COMBINE BOTH IN LOOKING AT WAYS TO PUT MORE -- TO UP THE COST, TO PUT MORE PRESSURE ON PUTIN. I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE LONG-TERM SECURITY CHALLENGES THAT THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, ESPECIALLY NATO, FACE. AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN DANCE AROUND IT VERY MUCH LONGER. I MEAN, WE ALL WISH IT WASN'T THE CASE. WE ALL WISH IT WOULD GO AWAY. WE ALL WISH THAT PUTIN WOULD CHOOSE TO MODERNIZE HIS COUNTRY AND MOVE WEST INSTEAD OF SINKING HIMSELF INTO HISTORICAL ROOTS OF CZAR-LIKE BEHAVIOR AND INTIMIDATION ALONG BORDERS AND PROJECTING RUSSIAN POWER IN PLACES LIKE RUSSIA AND ELSEWHERE. I THINK THE JURY IS IN. I THINK HE CONTINUES TO DO WHAT HE'S DOING AND GO AS FAR AS HE CAN GET AWAY WITH. AND I BELIEVE WE GOT TO REGROUP AND WE GOT TO REGROUP QUICKLY BECAUSE I WORRY VERY MUCH ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SYRIA RIGHT NOW. TROOPS ON THE GROUND TO ALLEGEDLY PROTECT, YOU KNOW, MILITARY SUPPLIES. WHAT IS RUSSIA'S REAL OBJECTIVE? YOU KNOW, THE STATED OBJECTIVE, THE PUBLIC OBJECTIVE TO FIGHT TERRORISM HAS ALWAYS BEEN THEIR RATIONALE. WHY DID THEY SUPPORT ASSAD? BECAUSE AFTER ASSAD THERE WOULD BE TERRORISM. NOW, OBVIOUSLY IF WE HAD A DIFFERENT APPROACH FROM THE BEGINNING WORKING TOGETHER WE MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED THAT. WE MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, HELPED TO A POLITICAL TRANSITION. SO I THINK WE GOT TO SPEND A LOT MORE TIME. ALL THE RUSSIAN EXPERTS THAT, YOU KNOW, THOUGHT THAT THEIR WORK WAS DONE OFF THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL, I HOPE THEY WILL BE DUSTING OFF THEIR MATERIALS. AND I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU, STROBE TALBOTT, AND GET BACK IN THE GAME WITH US BECAUSE I THINK RUSSIA'S OBJECTIVES ARE TO STYMIE AND TO CONFRONT AND TO UNDERMINE AMERICAN POWER WHENEVER AND WHEREVER THEY CAN. AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH TO BE SURPRISED ABOUT THAT. SO WHERE WE CAN WORK WITH THEM, YOU KNOW, THAT'S ONE OF THE CRITICISMS THAT SOMETIMES COMES FROM THE RIGHT, THE REPUBLICANS. WHAT DID THE RESET EVER ACCOMPLISH? WELL, ACTUALLY QUITE A LOT. WE DID THE NEW START AGREEMENT. WE GOT COOPERATION ON IRAN BECAUSE WHEN WE GOT THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO PASS THE SANCTIONS THAT WE HAD BEEN WORKING SO HARD ON, THAT WAS UNDER MEDVED HE IN 2010, WE GOT SUPPORT TO SHIP LETHAL MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT ACROSS RUSSIA TO RESUPPLY OUR TROOPS WE GOT A LOT. NOW, THAT ALL CHANGED ONCE PUTIN ANNOUNCED HE WAS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT AGAIN. I DON'T ADMIRE VERY MUCH ABOUT MR. PUTIN BUT THE IDEA YOU CAN STAND UP AND SAY I WILL BE YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT, THAT DOES HAVE A CERTAIN ATTRACTION TO IT.  SO I THINK WE GOT -- WE ARE NOT SPENDING THE TIME, WE'RE NOT THINKING, WE'RE NOT DIGGING DEEP INTO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO. SO TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF THE WOMAN WHO ASKED, WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO GET BACK TALKING ABOUT HOW WE TRY TO CONFINE, CONTAIN, DETER RUSSIAN AGGRESSION IN EUROPE AND BEYOND AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE BEST TOOLS FOR DOING THAT. AND DON'T LOSE SIGHT BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES UP THERE AS WELL. I WAS ALWAYS OF THAT OPINION, EXPRESSED IT VOCALLY WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION AND NOTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE IN ANY WAY PERSUADED ME OTHERWISE.  WELL, I DO THINK WE'RE CAPABLE OF DOING MORE THAN ONE THING. ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES IT APPEARS DIFFICULT. AND I THINK WE'VE GOT TO BE MUCH MORE GLOBAL IN OUR THINKING AND GLOBALLY PRESENT. THE REBALANCING TO ASIA, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE PIVOT, WAS IN RESPONSE TO THE VERY REAL SENSE OF ABANDONMENT THAT ASIAN LEADERS EXPRESSED TO ME AND MY PHONE CALLS TO THEM BEFORE I EVER WENT TO THE REGION IN FEBRUARY OF 2009, YOU KNOW, THEY BELIEVED THAT BECAUSE WE WERE SO FOCUSED IN AFGHANISTAN AND WE WERE SO FOCUSED IN IRAQ AND OBVIOUSLY HAD TO BE GIVEN ALL THAT WE HAD INVESTED THERE THAT WE WERE JUST NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE DEVELOPMENTS IN ASIA. I THINK WE'VE COME SOME WAYS IN TRYING TO REBALANCE, BUT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. THERE'S MUCH AT STAKE IN HOW WE DEAL WITH ALL THE PLAYERS IN ASIA. I'M HOPING THAT UPCOMING TRIP WITH PRESIDENT PING PRODUCES POSITIVE OUTCOMES. I THOUGHT THE CLIMATE AGREEMENT WAS QUITE CONSEQUENTIAL, HAVING BEEN IN COPENHAGEN IN 2009 WHEN WE HAD TO LITERALLY BREAK INTO A MEETING WHERE THE CHINESE WERE CONSOLIDATING INDIA, SOUTH AFRICA, BRAZIL AGAINST ANY KIND OF MOVEMENT TOWARD THE NON-ADVANCED ECONOMIES TAKING RESPONSIBILITY. SO I THINK WE GOT SOME GOOD STAKES IN THE GROUND BUT WE DON'T HAVE A STRATEGY YET THAT WILL BE CONSISTENT. THE LAST THING I WILL SAY, MARTIN, AND I ELUDED IN MY REMARKS, ONE OF OUR REAL , YOU KNOW, PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW IS WE DON'T HAVE A CONSISTENT FOREIGN POLICY THAT IS BIPARTISAN. LET ALONE NONPARTISAN. AND I THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM. I WAS APPALLED WHEN THOSE REPUBLICAN SENATORS WROTE TO THE AYATOLLAH. I THOUGHT IT WAS INCREDIBLY, YOU KNOW, SHORT-SIGHTED AND JUST WRONG-HEADED. AND I DON'T THINK -- I DON'T KNOW HOW WE REBUILD A CONSISTENT FOREIGN POLICY FROM ADMINISTRATION TO ADMINISTRATION REGARDLESS OF REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT. YOU KNOW, IT WAS A LOT EASIER IN A BIPOLAR WORLD US AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION. WE CAN'T WORK AT IT IF WE DON'T HAVE A SET OF STRATEGIC PILLARS AND ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES THAT WE CAN PRESENT TO OUR OWN PEOPLE AND PRESENT TO THE CONGRESS AND PRESENT TO THE WORLD. SO I THINK WE HAVE WORK TO DO.  WELL, AS TO THE FIRST ONE, IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT IN HINDSIGHT TO SAY WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF SOMETHING DIFFERENT HAD BEEN DONE. IF WE REMEMBER BACK TO THAT TIME, PRIME MINISTER CAMERON HAD LOST THE VOTE IN THE PARLIAMENT. HE WANTED TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY OF TAKING SOME LIMITED MILITARY ACTION IN LIGHT OF SYRIA'S USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS. SO IT BECAME CLEARER THERE WAS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT VOTE IN THE CONGRESS. NOT CLEAR AT ALL THAT IT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL WHICH WOULD HAVE LEFT THE PRESIDENT WITH AUTHORITY, CERTAINLY, WITH EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY TO ACT BUT SINCE IT HAD BECOME A PUBLIC DEBATE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT DECISION FOR HIM TO MAKE. I DO THINK THAT NOT BEING ABLE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON IT COST US. I AM CERTAIN OF THAT. THAT STILL COMES BACK IN CONVERSATIONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE WITH ME, BOTH HERE AT HOME AND PEOPLE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. BUT I DO THINK IT WAS A NET POSITIVE TO GET AS MUCH OF THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS OUT AS WE COULD AND THERE WAS NO WAY WE COULD HAVE DONE THAT WITHOUT RUSSIAN COOPERATION. I THINK THERE WAS HOPE AFTER THAT KIND OF COOPERATION PRODUCED POSITIVE RESULTS THAT THEN WE COULD GO BACK TO TALKING MORE BROADLY WITH THE RUSSIANS ABOUT WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE IN SYRIA AND WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE WITH ASSAD. THEY DID NOT RECIPROCATE ON THAT. SO I THINK IT'S LIKE MUCH IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. IT'S A MIXED PICTURE. SOME POSITIVE. YOU KNOW SOME NEGATIVE. , WITH RESPECT TO THE REFUGEES, I HAVE SAID I THINK WE'RE COMING UP ON THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY, I THINK THERE SHOULD BE AN EMERGENCY GLOBAL GATHERING WHERE THE U.N. LITERALLY DRIVES TO GET COMMITMENTS. WE DID THAT WITH HAITI. AFTER THE HAITI EARTHQUAKE, WE HAD A HUGE GATHERING AT THE U.N. WHERE LITERALLY IT WAS LIKE A PLEDGING CONFERENCE WHERE WE SAID, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? WHAT CAN YOU CONTRIBUTE? AND LITTLE COUNTRIES TO BIG COUNTRIES ALL STEPPED UP, AND IT WAS A GREAT SHOW OF SUPPORT IN THE FACE OF A TERRIBLE NATURAL DISASTER. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR, AND I PUBLICLY CALLED ON THE U.N. TO CONVENE SUCH A GATHERING. DO IT AGAIN TODAY IN FRONT OF ALL OF YOU. THE UNITED STATES HAS TO BE AT THE TABLE. HAS TO BE LEADING. WE WERE IN A STRONG POSITION TO DO THAT ON HAITI. EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT ON OUR DOORSTEP, WE HAVE A REAL INTEREST IN WORKING, NOT JUST WITH OUR EUROPEAN FRIENDS -- I BELIEVE THIS IS A GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY, AND IF YOU'RE TOO FAR AWAY OR FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU DON'T THINK YOU CAN TAKE REFUGEES, THEN YOU HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE MONEY. YOU SHOULD BE SUPPORTING, NOT ONLY THOSE REFUGEES FLEEING BUT THE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT JORDAN AND LEBANON AND TURKEY HAVE BEEN DOING AND THEY HAVE NOT GOTTEN THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT THEY NEED. IN FACT, THE LAST I CHECKED THE U.N. APPEAL HAD ONLY REACHED 37%. SO THERE IS BOTH FINANCIAL WORK AND CONTRIBUTIONS THAT NEED TO BE FORTHCOMING AND COUNTRIES NEED TO BE MORE OPEN AND WILLING TO TAKE REFUGEES. I OBVIOUSLY WANT THE UNITED STATES TO DO OUR PART, BUT I ALSO WANT THIS TO BE A GLOBAL RESPONSE AND SO I HOPE WITH ALL THESE LEADERS GATHERED, WITH POPE FRANCIS ADDRESSING THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN JUST ABOUT TWO WEEKS, WE CAN SEE SOMETHING VISIBLE WITH PEOPLE MAKING THEIR COMMITMENTS NATION BY NATION OR IN THE CASE OF THE E.U. OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL.  WELL, I'LL RESTRAIN MYSELF AND ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION FIRST. I THINK THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE, SISSY. I REALLY DO. I DON'T THINK IT'S EASY, BUT LET'S GO BACK A FEW YEARS. NOT SO LONG AGO ISRAEL AND TURKEY WERE WORKING VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES. THEN CAME THE FLOTILLA AND THEN CAME THE RESPONSE BY THE ISRAELI MILITARY. THEN CAME MANY YEARS OF, YOU KNOW, REAL HARD FEELINGS THAT GOT HARDER AND HARDER, AND WE LOST WHAT WAS A -- NOT JUST WORKING RELATIONSHIP BUT A REAL BRIDGE. SIMILARLY, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF INSTANCES WHERE IN THE PAST ISRAEL HAS WORKED IN COMMON CONCERT WITH A NUMBER OF THE GULF COUNTRIES. ISRAEL IS NOW BACK IN A VERY PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH EGYPT. OBVIOUSLY WITH JORDAN. SO THERE ARE THE PIECES OF NATIONAL AND REGIONAL INTERESTS AND THAT I THINK VERY DILIGENTLY AND PROBABLY FRUSTRATINGLY COULD BE PULLED BACK TOGETHER. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE UNITED STATES CAN LEAD, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY WE CAN TRY TO CATALYZE AND ENCOURAGE. AND I THINK THERE IS POTENTIAL THERE. BECAUSE AS I SAID IN MY SPEECH, I'LL DO EVERYTHING TO TELL TURKEY AND QATAR IT'S NOT IN THEIR INTERESTS. IT'S NOT IN EGYPT'S INTEREST. THEY BOTH CARE DEEPLY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN EGYPT FOR SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT REASONS THAN OTHERS BUT THEY CARE. AND SO I THINK WE HAVE TO BUILD THE CASE, AND I THINK AMERICAN DIPLOMATS COULD HELP BUILD THAT CASE AND THEN LOOK FOR WAYS. I SPENT, YOU KNOW, LITERALLY YEARS TRYING TO GET THE ISRAEL IS TO FINALLY APOLOGIZE TO THE TURKS ON THE FLOTILLA. THERE WAS ONE MEMORABLE DAY DURING ONE OF MY VACATIONS WHERE I WAS LITERALLY TALKING TO THE ISRAELIS. I WAS TALKING TO HENRY KINSINGER TO MAKE THE STRATEGIC ARGUMENT WHICH WE ALL BELIEVED THAT THE SOONER THAT ISRAEL DID THAT THE SOONER THEY COULD GET BACK TO SOME KIND OF DISCUSSION PERHAPS. FINALLY THAT HAPPENED WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WENT TO ISRAEL, AND I WAS VERY HAPPY THAT, YOU KNOW, NOW WE HAVE A DIFFERENT TURKEY WITH A DIFFERENT KIND OF SET OF CHALLENGES. BUT INTERESTS REMAIN THE SAME. YOU KNOW TURKEY'S INTERESTS FOR , STABILITY ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT THAN THEY WERE EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THE LEADERSHIP, ATTITUDES SEEMED TO HAVE ALTERED. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. I WOULD MAKE A HIGH PRIORITY OF THAT. THIS ADMINISTRATION IN THE LAST, YOU KNOW, YEAR AND A HALF OR SO OF ITS TERM WILL BE SIMILARLY DOING THAT BECAUSE LET'S START SEEING WHAT WE CAN DO. IT KIND OF GOES BACK TO ROBIN'S QUESTION. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE UNTIL YOU TRY TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER. I THINK THE MORE WE CAN TRY TO PUT THOSE PIECES TOGETHER, THE MORE WE'LL KNOW WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING CAN COME OF IT. WITH RESPECT TO THE LACK OF SUPPORT FOR THE AGREEMENT. HONESTLY, I THINK IT'S IN SOME INSTANCES GENUINE. JUST AS I SAID IN MY REMARKS, I THINK THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO I DEEPLY RESPECT ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE CERTAINLY, AND I WOULD RESPECT THEM ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AS WELL WHO JUST HAVE CONCERNS THAT THEY DON'T FEEL HAVE BEEN ANSWERED. BUT I THINK THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND IT IS, YOU KNOW, TO CLOSE RANKS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT, AGAINST THIS KIND OF DIPLOMACY BUT WITHOUT OFFERING AN ALTERNATIVE AND THAT'S WHAT I FIND -- I DON'T MIND DEBATING ALTERNATIVES. I MEAN WHEN WE DID THE NEW START , TREATY, IT WAS REALLY HARD TO GET THE VOTES FOR THAT. I REMEMBER, YOU KNOW, GOING UP AND MAKING THE CASE BUT WE GOT SOME REPUBLICAN VOTES. BUT WE'RE LIVING IN A VERY PARTISAN ATMOSPHERE RIGHT NOW, AND I THINK WE DO HAVE TO DO MORE, JUST AS WE -- I'LL END WITH THIS BY SAYING, JUST AS WE HAVE TO IN DIPLOMACY TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE CONSTANTLY IF NOT TO PERSUADE THEM, TO JOIN WITH US TO ELIMINATE AN ARGUMENT THAT THEY HAVE, THAT THEY WON'T JOIN BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN CONSULTED, THEY HAVE BEEN BROUGHT ALONG, THEY HAVE BEEN BRIEFED. WE HAVE TO DO THAT WITH THE CONGRESS AS WELL. AND IT'S NOT EASY IF THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE OPEN MINDS, BUT WE STILL HAVE TO DO IT SO WE CAN BE IN THE POSITION OF SAYING, YOU KNOW, WE TOLD YOU THIS. WE OFFERED YOU THIS. WE BRIEFED YOU THIS. WE GAVE YOU THIS INFORMATION AND YOU HAVEN'T COME FORTH WITH ANY KIND OF, YOU KNOW, RATIONAL OR RATIONALE TO OPPOSE US. YOU'RE JUST OPPOSING US. IT'S VERY POLITICAL. AFTER DISCOUNTING THOSE WHO I THINK ARE GENUINELY SKEPTICAL.",Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton on Iran Nuclear Agreement

FOR THOSE OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE CONCERNS, WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM  THERE WERE MANY IMPORTANT DECISIONS MADE WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF STATE. CERTAINLY BENGHAZI IS KNOWN TO MANY AMERICANS BECAUSE WE LOST FOUR AMERICANS. IT WAS A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY, NOT ONLY FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE FOUR MEN LOST, BUT OBVIOUSLY FOR OUR COUNTRY, AS IT IS WHENEVER WE LOSE ANYBODY, EITHER UNIFORMED MILITARY OR SERVING ON THE CIVILIAN SIDE. I THINK WE HAVE HAD INCIDENTS LIKE THIS OVER THE COURSE OF OUR HISTORY. WHEN PRESIDENT REAGAN WAS PRESIDENT WE HAD A TERRIBLE INCIDENT IN BEIRUT WHERE WE LOST HUNDREDS OF EMPLOYEES AT OUR EMBASSY. INSTEAD OF TURNING IT INTO A PARTISAN ISSUE, PEOPLE SAID WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE? WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS PRESIDENT WE HAVE THE BOMBINGS IN TANZANIA AND KENYA. WE LOST MANY PEOPLE, ABOUT A DOZEN AMERICANS AND MANY OTHER KENYANS WHO WORKED AT HER EMBASSY. IN FACT, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS GONE TO THE SITE TO PAY HIS RESPECT. AGAIN, WE SAID, IT IS A DANGEROUS WORLD AND WE SEND PEOPLE INTO HARMS WAY, LET'S LEARN FROM THAT. SO WHAT I DID WHEN THIS HAPPENED ON MY WATCH WAS I SAID LET'S TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IN FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER AND HOW WE LEARN FROM IT. I REGRET IT HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A PARTISAN ISSUE. THERE HAS BEEN ONE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION, A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS BY REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY. I SAID LET'S FOLLOW EVERY LEGITIMATE RECOMMENDATION TO MAKE OUR PEOPLE SAFER, AND THAT IS WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING.  THIS IS A TOUGH ONE, BECAUSE NO ONE SHOULD TRUST IRAN, I CERTAINLY DON'T. I WORKED HARD WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF STATE TO PUT INTO PLACE THE CRIPPLING SANCTIONS THAT LED IRAN EVENTUALLY TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. I THINK THE AGREEMENT ON BALANCE IS IN OUR INTEREST AND THE INTEREST OF THE REGION AND ISRAEL IN TERMS OF SAFETY AND SECURITY BECAUSE IT PUTS A LID ON THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM THAT GIVES US TIME, THE OPPORTUNITY TO FORM A COALITION TO DEAL WITH ALL THE OTHER BAD THINGS THEY DO. THEY SUPPORT STABILIZE THEM, THREATEN ISRAEL, SUPPORT HEZBOLLAH AND OTHER PROXIES. I THINK WE HAVE TO GO INTO THIS VERY CLEAR EYED. AS PRESIDENT, I WOULD ENFORCE IT TO THE LETTER AND MAKE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ANYTHING WE NEED TO DO WE WOULD DO. ON THE TIMING OF THE INSPECTIONS WE HAVE MUCH MORE ACCESS TO THE PROGRAMS THAN WE EVER HAVE BEFORE, BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME LIMITATIONS, AND WE NEED TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE AS FAR AND HARD AS POSSIBLE. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, IT IS BETTER TO HAVE HAD THE AGREEMENT TO PUT THE LID ON THEN TO TRY TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THE OTHER BAD THINGS THEY DO WHILE THEY ARE STILL PURSUING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  I WOULD VOTE FOR IT AS IS. REMEMBER, IT AFFECT INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT. IT WAS REALLY HARD GETTING RUSSIA AND CHINA TO SIGN-UP FOR THE SANCTIONS AND GETTING THE REST OF THE WORLD TO ENFORCE THEM. WE CANNOT ALONE PREVENT IRAN FROM DOING SOMETHING IS A -- IT IS INTENT UPON DOING SOMETHING THAT THE WORLD TOGETHER GIVES US THE BEST CHANCE. SO I WOULD SUPPORT THE AGREEMENT.  I HAVE HAD SOME DIFFERENCES. THEY ARE PUBLICLY KNOWN. I WAS IN FAVOR, ALONG WITH GENERAL PETRONIUS AND LEON PANETTA TO TRY TO ARM MODERATE REBELS AGAINST THE ROUGE ON -- REGIME EARLY. I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO FIGURE OUT WHO WAS WHO IN THAT SITUATION. YOU CANNOT REALLY SAY WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. I WAS IN FAVOR OF DOING THAT. I THINK WHERE WE ARE NOW IS NUMBER ONE WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE ISIS IS A THREAT. IT IS A THREAT TO US BECAUSE IT DOES DOMINATE TERRITORY, WHICH GIVES THEM A BROADER REACH. I DO USES THE INTERNET TO DIRECT ATTACKS. WE HAVE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. I THINK WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION -- ADMINISTRATION IS NOW DOING, BUILDING A COALITION AGAINST ISIS, GETTING THE IRAQIS TO STAND UP AFTER THEY ALLOWED THE ONE WE TRAIN TO FALL APART -- ALL OF THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT. THE UNITED STATES HAS SOME ASSETS BUT WE SHOULD NOT USE OUR OWN SOLDIERS TO FIGHT THAT WAR.  FIRST OF ALL, I SUPPORTED WHAT SENATORS MANSION AND TO ME FOR TRYING TO DO. IT WAS A BIPARTISAN PIECE OF LEFT -- LEGISLATION. THOSE ARE HARD TO COME BY PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND A GREAT COMMITMENT THEY MADE. I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO BRING IT BACK AND ADVOCATE FOR IT. WE HAVE JUST SEEN ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A MAN MENTALLY ILL WHO KILLED THE YOUNG WOMEN IN THE THEATER AND LAFAYETTE, LOUISIANA. IT JUST CANNOT GO ON. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO ALLOW PEOPLE WHO ARE DOMESTIC ABUSERS, MENTALLY UNSTABLE, AND WHO FRANKLY, COULD BE TERRORISTS, TO GET ACCESS TO GUNS. THE MAN WHO KILLED OUR MARINES OF THE SAILOR WAS SOMEONE WHO ALSO RAISES SERIOUS QUESTIONS FOR ME, HOW HE GOT A HOLD OF A WEAPON WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS HE WAS SAYING ON HIS INTERNET COMMUNICATION. I AM 100% OF -- IN FAVOR OF UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. I WILL SPEAK OUT BEFORE I PRESIDENT AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT. I WILL TRY TO DO WHAT I HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DID, WHICH IS TO GET SUCCESSFUL GUN CONTROL.  IT IS A BIG DEBATE. THERE WAS A FIRST EXECUTIVE ORDER TO NOT HAVE PEOPLE ARMED ON MILITARY BASES. I WOULD HAVE TO LISTEN CLOSELY TO WHY THE MILITARY HAS A DIFFERENT OPINION, AND I WOULD WANT TO BE FRIGHTENED WE FOUND BY WHAT THEY ARE ADVISING ME. THEY ARE THE EXPERT, AND I WOULD WANT TO SUPPORT THAT.  YOU MEAN THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL FOR BEING BRAVE ENOUGH TO COME FORWARD AND TALK ABOUT YOUR LIFE AND ASKED THAT QUESTION. I THINK I JOIN EVERYONE HERE IN WISHING YOU THE VERY BEST AS YOU CONTINUE WITH YOUR RECOVERY. YOU HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST STEP, AND I HOPE YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL GOING FORWARD. YOU ARE HIM YOUNG MAN, A BRIGHT FUTURE, AND I HOPE YOU GET THE HELP AND SUPPORT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO BE A SUCCESSFUL RECOVERY PERSON. SECONDLY, I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS SINCE I STARTED MY CAMPAIGN. THE VERY FIRST EVENT I DID AS A CANDIDATE IN KEY NEW HAMPSHIRE AT A VERY SMALL CAFE, A RETIRED DOCTOR ASKED ME WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO ABOUT THE HAIR WHEN -- HEROINE EPIDEMIC IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I HEARD THE SAME THING ABOUT MESS AND PILLS IN IOWA. THE RATE OF DEATH BY OVERDOSE IS INCREASING TRAGICALLY. LAST YEAR WE HAD MORE DEATHS BY OVERDOSES THAN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT IN OUR COUNTRY. HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO DO AS PRESIDENT. I HAVE BEEN CONSULTING WITH THE PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF WHO HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE AND NOW TRYING TO STAY CLEAN WITH EXPERTS AND FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO OVERDOSE. WE HAVE TO GET BACK INTO THE BUSINESS OF EDUCATING BUSINESS. I REMEMBER NANCY REAGAN WITH THE JUST SAY NO CAMPAIGN. IT WAS IMPORTANT AT THE TIME TRYING TO EDUCATE YOUNG PEOPLE AND PARENTS. I WANT A VERY BROAD-BASED EDUCATION INFORMATION CAMPAIGN. SOME JUMP PEOPLE -- YOUNG PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE RISKS. WHEN A YOUNG PERSON SAYS HE OR SHE IS READY, THEY WANT HELP, VERY OFTEN THEY CANNOT FIND HELP . WERE YOU ABLE TO FIND HELP WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED LOOKING FOR IT? WHERE DID YOU FINALLY GET HELP?  THANK GOODNESS FOR SERENITY, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH PLACES TO GO. VERY OFTEN SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE IS LOOKING FOR HELP. IF WE HAD AS MANY PEOPLE DYING FROM DRUG OVERDOSES WHO WERE DINING OF THE DISEASE, REMEMBER HOW EXCITED EVERYONE GOT ABOUT THE TERRIBLE DISEASE EBOLA. YOU CAN BET WE WOULD BE TOTALLY FOCUSED ON HOW TO HELP PEOPLE. WE NEED TO BRING THE SAME FOCUS WITH RESOURCES TO DEALING WITH DRUGS AND ALCOHOL AND OTHER FORMS OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE. I WANT TO DO WHAT I CAN TO HELP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  OF COURSE.  OBVIOUSLY SOME PEOPLE HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE OR OTHER KINDS OF POLITICAL SUPPORT, BUT YOU CAN GET OUT THERE AND RUN. LOOK AT ALL THE CANDIDATES THIS TIME. PEOPLE COME FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE AND DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. I THINK IT WILL BE UP TO THE VOTERS TO DECIDE. I THINK MY PRESIDENT -- HUSBAND IS A REALLY GOOD PRESIDENT AND I WILL TRY TO MAKE THAT CASE TO THE AMERICAN VOTER.  WHEN I WAS A SENATOR I WORK ACROSS THE AISLE. ONE OF THE PEOPLE I WORKED WITH, LINDSEY GRAHAM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ON THE OTHER SIDE. THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS. I WOULDN'T GO ANYWHERE ANYTIME TO TALK TO ANYBODY ABOUT HOW WE COULD FIND COMMON GROUND. I KNOW IT IS NOT EASY, BUT I KNOW IT IS DOABLE. I WOULD BE INVITING PEOPLE ALL THE TIME IN MEETING PEOPLE ALL THE TIME, BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU MIGHT FIND AN AGREEMENT. I THINK THAT IS PART OF WHAT IS MISSING RIGHT NOW. PEOPLE DID NOT SOCIALIZE AND SPEND TIME TOGETHER. YOU WILL NOT GET PEOPLE TO AGREE WITH YOU ALL THE TIME. LOOKS LIKE WE MIGHT FINALLY GET A BILL TO PLANNED -- PLANNED THE HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION. THAT CANNOT HAPPEN UNLESS PEOPLE CROSS THE AISLE.  IT IS A REALLY GOOD QUESTION. I SERVED ON THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE, AND I THINK WE HAVE TO TRANSITION FROM A DEFENSE -- DEFENSE DEPARTMENT FOCUS ON A TRADITIONAL THREAT TO ONE THAT IS MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE AND AGILE AND ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE NEW THREAT WE FACE TODAY. FOR EXAMPLE, I THINK WE WILL SEE AN INCREASING USE OF SPECIAL FORCES THAT WILL BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE MORE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS ON A MUCH SMALLER BASIS THAN SENDING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN INTO COMBAT. I THINK WE HAVE TO DO MUCH MORE IN THE ARENA OF INTELLIGENCE AND SURVEILLANCE, AND USING THE INCREDIBLE SKILLS OUR MILITARY MEMBERS HAVE TO SUPPORT COALITIONS LIKE WHAT WE ARE DOING AGAINST ISIS. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT WARS . WE HAVE TO HAVE AND MAY BE ENOUGH TO DEFEND US AND COMMERCE. WE HAVE TO HAVE AN AIR FORCE THAT IS ADVANCED ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE NEW THREATS, WHAT WE SEE IN ISIS, BUT ALSO, WE HAVE TO BE SMART ABOUT LOOKING AT CYBER, SOMETHING I THINK WILL INCREASINGLY TAKE UP TIME OF OUR MILITARY. WE HAVE TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND DO A PLAN FOR THE 21ST CENTURY.  I THINK WHAT IS REALISTIC TO START BY SETTING HIGH GOALS. I THINK BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM WE COULD AS A COUNTRY HAVE HALF A BILLION SOLAR PANELS INSTALLED, AND I THINK BY THE END OF MY SECOND TERM WE COULD HAVE ENOUGH CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY TO POWER EVERY HOME IN AMERICA. PEOPLE SAY, HOW WILL WE EVER DO THAT? BUT IF WE LOOK AT WHAT SOME STATES HAVE ARTIE DONE, WE CAN SEE THE PATH FORWARD. IOWA ALREADY GETTING MORE THAN 30% OF ITS ENERGY FROM WIND. THINK ABOUT THAT. THAT IS NOT FAR FROM UPPING IT EVEN MORE. THE PLACE I WENT TO TO MAKE MY ANNOUNCEMENTS, THEY WERE USING SOLAR, AND THEY WERE USING GEOTHERMAL. THEY WERE HEATING AND COOLING THE FACILITY. IF WE PUT THE RIGHT TAX INCENTIVE IN, AND I BELIEVE WE CAN PAY FOR IT BY TRANSFERRING THE $60 BILLION SPENT OVER 10 YEARS ON OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION TO WIND, SOLAR, GEOTHERMAL AND ADVANCED BIOFUELS, CLEAN ENERGY, PLEASE CAN MEET THOSE BIG GOALS. I WILL TALK MORE ABOUT MY SPECIFIC PLANS AS WE GO FORWARD. IF WE TOOK THE TAX INCENTIVE AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS IT WOULD.  I CANNOT ANSWER IT. I WAS THERE AND HAD A ROLE IN IT. THIS IS LIKELY TO BE AN ISSUE THAT NO MATTER WHAT THE PRESIDENT DECIDES WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF A LAWSUIT. I AM NOT IN A POSITION TO IN ANY WAY INTERFERE WITH OR COMMENT ON THE DECISION UNTIL IT IS MADE WITHOUT CREATING PROBLEMS DOWN THE ROAD, AND I JUST WON'T DO THAT. I KNOW PEOPLE ARE ANXIOUS TO GET ME ON THE -- ON THE RECORD YES OR NO, AND I ANSWER DOZENS OF DOZENS OF QUESTIONS I CANNOT ANSWER BECAUSE OF MY PRIOR OFFICIAL ROLE. JOSH: BACK TO THE AUDIENCE.  I SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING IDEA THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT, IN ORDER TO CATCH CRIMINALS HAS TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE OPENLY WITH IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. WHAT I DO NOT APPROVE OF IS WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN FRANCISCO, BECAUSE IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE QUOTE SANCTUARY CITIES WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL TELL THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY YOU WON'T GET IN TROUBLE IF YOU REPORT THE MURDER, RAPE, BURGLARY, AND YOU ARE AN OTHERWISE A LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN, THAT IS ONE THING. BUT WHERE THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE SAID TELL US IF THIS GUY SHOWS UP AGAIN AND YOU DON'T DO IT, THAT IS NOT RIGHT, AND I DO NOT SUPPORT THAT.  I DO. MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE I AM A MOTHER AND NOW A GRANDMOTHER. I REALLY THINK WE NEED A PRESIDENT THAT WILL MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE WE ARE PART OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY AGAIN. I MEAN THAT WITH ALL MY HEART. I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO DIVIDED, TOO MANY BARRIERS WHETHER THEY ARE PARTISAN OR GEOGRAPHIC SEPARATING US, AND CERTAINLY WE HAVE SEEN PROBLEMS WITH RACE AND ETHNICITY AND ALL THE REST OF IT. IT DOES NOT MEAN WE WILL AGREE. WE HAVE STRONG DISAGREEMENTS PARTICULARLY ON POLITICS. THAT IS ALL FAIR GAME. I GREW UP WITH THE REPUBLICAN FATHER AND WE HAD ARGUMENTS AT THE DINNER TABLE PRACTICALLY EVERY NIGHT BUT A BAND OF THE DAY HE IS SOMEONE WHO WANTED TO SOLVE PROBLEMS, TO. THAT IS WHAT I THINK A GOOD PARENT DOES. WHEN YOU ARE RAISING A CHILD, THERE ARE SO MANY TOUGH DECISIONS YOU WANT TO MAKE. AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU WANT TO GIVE THAT PERSON LOVE AND SUPPORT AND THE DISCIPLINE AND DIRECTION THAT WILL MAKE HIM OR HER SUCCESSFUL. AND OUR COUNTRY TODAY I WANT EVERYONE TO FEEL LIKE WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. TO ME, THAT IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT. THAT IS HOW I WOULD APPROACH THE JOB.  PROBABLY BECAUSE I DID NOT START LIVING THE LIFE UNTIL I WAS IN THE 40'S. THE LIFE I LEAD THAT FORM TO ME AS A PERSON IS A VERY MIDDLE-CLASS PERSON WITH A. BUSINESSMEN AND A SABER EXTRAORDINAIRE. HE WAS A NAVY VETERAN. MY MOM HAD HAD A MISERABLE, AND THEN -- NEGLECTED CHILDHOOD AND SHE CARED DEEPLY ABOUT EDUCATION AND INVESTED IN ME AND MY BROTHERS, SO I FEEL LIKE I WAS FORMED MANY YEARS BEFORE I SHOWED UP IN PUBLIC LIFE. I ALWAYS WORKED HARD AND TAKING RESPONSIBILITY. I DON'T FORGET WHERE I CAME FROM.",WMUR-TV Interview with Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton

THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. IT IS GREAT BEING HERE WITH A ROOM FULL OF DEMOCRATS. AND I WANT TO THANK STEPHANIE, I WANT TO THANK DEBBIE, AND ALL THE ELECTED OFFICIALS, PARTY LEADERS, AND GRASSROOTS ORGANIZERS WHO EVERY DAY HELP STRENGTHEN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR NATION. YOU ARE BUILDING OUR PARTY IN EVERY DISTRICT IN EVERY STATE. I WANT TO BE YOUR PARTNER EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.  I ALSO WANT TO GIVE A BIG SHOUT OUT TO A GIANT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, SOMEONE WHO HAS DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO SERVING HIS FELLOW AMERICANS, AND WHO HAS INSPIRED AND ENCOURAGED SO MANY OF US OVER THE YEARS. THE GREAT WALTER MONDALE.  WE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, FOR WHERE YOU COME FROM, YOU SHOULD HAVE AN EQUAL SHOT AT SUCCESS. THAT IS THE AMERICA WE LOVE, THAT IS THE AMERICA WE ARE FIGHTING OR. AND FUNDAMENTALLY, THAT IS WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. WHETHER OUR COUNTRY KEEPS MOVING TOWARD OPPORTUNITY AND PROSPERITY FOR ALL, OR WHETHER REPUBLICANS GET ANOTHER CHANCE TO RIP AWAY THE PROGRESS WE HAVE WORKED SO HARD TO ACHIEVE. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY THESE PAST SIX AND A HALF YEARS. BUT LET'S NOT FORGET WHAT WE INHERITED FROM THE REPUBLICANS. THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. THANKS TO THE HARD WORK AND SACRIFICE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT OBAMA --  WE ARE STANDING AGAIN. BUT WE ARE NOT YET RUNNING LIKE WE SHOULD. THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THE BEST UNDERSTANDS THE PRESSURES FACING THE FAMILIES OF AMERICA AND THE CHALLENGES FACING US IN THE WORLD. AND WHO HAS THE SKILL AND TENACITY TO TACKLE THEM. TODAY FAMILIES ARE STRETCHED IN A MILLION DIRECTIONS AND SO ARE THEIR BUDGETS WERE COSTS FOR EVERYTHING FROM PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO CHILDCARE TO COLLEGE ARE GOING UP FASTER THAN WAGES AND MINIMUM-WAGE JOBS CANNOT LIFT YOU OUT OF POVERTY. MIDDLE-CLASS PAYCHECKS HAVE NOT INCREASED EVEN THE CORPORATE PROFITS AND CEO PAY KEEPS RISING. AND AT A TIME WHEN MORE WOMEN THAN EVER ARE THEIR FAMILIES MAIN BREADWINNER, THEY DO NOT GET EQUAL PAY. AND UNIONS ARE UNDER CONSERVATIVE ATTACK BY REPUBLICANS AND THEIR ALLIES.  AND THINK OF THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS EATING HELD BACK EITHER STUDENT DEBT. THEY CANNOT START A BUSINESS, THEY CANNOT BUY A HOUSE, THEY CANNOT EVEN GET MARRIED BECAUSE OF THE LOANS HANGING OVER THEIR HEAD THAT IS NOT THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN AMERICA. IN AMERICA, IF YOU WORK HARD AND DO YOUR PART, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. THAT IS THE BASIC BARGAIN THAT MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. AND THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE WORKED SO HARD OVER THE YEARS TO STRENGTHEN AND DEFEND. THAT BARGAIN IS WHAT KEPT MY GRANDFATHER GOING TO WORK IN THE SCRANTON LACE MILL FACTORY EVERY DAY. IT IS WHAT LED MY FATHER TO BELIEVE THAT IF HE SAVED AND SACRIFICED, HIS SMALL BUSINESS PRINTING FABRIC IN CHICAGO COULD PROVIDE US WITH A MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE AND I DO KNOW WHAT, IT DID. WHEN MY HUSBAND PUT PEOPLE FIRST AND MADE THAT BARGAIN MEAN SOMETHING AGAIN IN THE 1990'S, WE HAD 23 MILLION NEW JOBS, A BALANCED BUDGET, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES WE ALL GREW TOGETHER, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP, BUT EVERYONE.  AND WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA DID IT, WE PULLED BACK FROM THE BRINK OF DEPRESSION. SAVE THE AUTO INDUSTRY, CURVED WALL ABUSES AND PROVIDED HEALTH CARE TO 15 MILLION PEOPLE.  THE EVIDENCE IS PRETTY CLEAR. THE BASIC BARGAIN WORKS. IF EVERYBODY DOES THEIR FAIR SHARE, AND EVERYBODY GETS A FAIR SHOT FROM OUR WHOLE COUNTRY SUCCEEDS. AND THAT SUCCESS JUST NOT JUST GO TO A FEW, IT IS WIDELY SHARED. DEMOCRATS HAVE PROVEN THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN. NOW IT IS UP TO US TO RENEW THAT BARGAIN FOR A NEW GENERATION. TO DO WHAT WE KNOW WORKS AND WHAT WE KNOW IS RIGHT. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN GETS A CHANCE TO PURSUE HIS OR HER DREAMS TO LIVE UP TO THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. THAT IS WHAT I WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT. THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE TELL ME THEY WANT. AS I CRISSCROSSED THE COUNTRY, LISTENING, LIKE THE SINGLE MOM WHO IS JUGGLING A JOB AND CLASSES AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE I'LL WHILE RAISING THREE KIDS ALONE. SHE IS DOING WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO GIVE HERSELF AND HER KIDS A GOOD LIFE. SHE DOES NOT EXPECT ANYTHING TO COME EASY, BUT SHE ASKED ME, IS THERE NOT ANYTHING WE CAN DO? IT IS NOT QUITE SO HARD. OR THE STUDENT WHO TOLD ME THAT PAYING FOR COLLEGE SHOULD NOT BE THE HARDEST THING ABOUT GOING TO COLLEGE.  OR THE GRANDMOTHER WHO IS RAISING HER GRANDCHILD BECAUSE HER DAUGHTER IS HOOKED ON HEROIN, AND NOW SHE NEEDS HELP WITH CHILDCARE WHILE SHE GOES BACK TO WORK. I BELIEVE RAISING INCOME AND SUPPORTING FAMILIES IS THE DEFINING ECONOMIC CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME.  AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE MADE IT THE FOCUS OF MY CAMPAIGN, AND IT WILL BE MY MISSION EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THESE ARE NOT NEW FIGHTS FOR YOU, OR FOR ME. MY FIRST JOB OUT OF LAW SCHOOL WAS NOT AT SOME BIG FIRMS, WAS AT THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. AND IF YOU YEARS LATER I STARTED AN ORGANIZATION CALLED ARKANSAS ADVOCATES FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. MY WHOLE LIFE I HAVE WORKED TO EVEN THE ODDS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE ODDS STACKED AGAINST THEM. THAT IS WHAT WE DEMOCRATS DO. THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE. IT IS WHAT KEEPS US WORKING AND FIGHTING THROUGH EVERY UP AND DOWN. FOR THE VALUES WE SHARE IN THE COUNTRY WE LOVE. DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT CORPORATIONS SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY GOUGE US ON DRUG PRICES OR POLLUTE OUR ENVIRONMENT, OR EXPLOIT WORKERS. THAT THEY JUST CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO WRITE THEIR OWN RULES THAT EVERYONE ELSE'S EXPENSE.  I BELIEVE IN STRONG GROWTH, FAIR GROWTH, AND LONG-TERM GROWTH AND THAT THE WORDS REWARDS OF OUR SUCCESS CANNOT JUST GO TO THE WEALTHY. THAT WOULD A COMPANY DOES WELL THAT SHAREHOLDERS AND EXECUTIVES ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO SHOULD BENEFIT. THE PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THAT COMPANY IN AND DAY OUT AND PRODUCE THOSE PROFITS SHOULD SHARE IN THEM TOO.  DEMOCRATS BELIEVE AMERICANS DESERVE A RAISE, THAT WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL PAY.  WE ARE THE ONES FIGHTING TO HELP FAMILIES AFFORD COLLEGE. DEMOCRATS UNDERSTAND YOU CANNOT GO TO WORK IF YOU CANNOT FIND CHILDCARE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE HE SHOULD LOSE YOUR PAYCHECK OR YOUR JOB WHEN YOU HAVE A BABY OR SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY GETS SICK. WE BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE DESERVES ACCESS TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE.  WE ARE THE ONES STANDING UP AND SAYING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS HERE TO STAY.  WE HAVE COME TO FAR AND NOT TOO HARD TO LET ANYONE DESTROY THAT NOW. AND WE ARE ONES WHO WANT TO MAKE SOCIAL SECURITY EVEN STRONGER AND WHO WILL FIGHT ANY ATTEMPT TO WEAKEN AMERICA'S COMMITMENT TO OUR SENIORS. WE BELIEVE IN A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP OR THE MILLIONS OF IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY WHO CONTRIBUTE TO IT EVERY SINGLE DAY.  DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WHAT A PRACTICE, OR WHO YOU LOVE, AMERICA HAS A PLACE FOR YOU, AND YOUR RIGHTS ARE JUST AS SACRED AS ANYONE ELSE'S.  BY THE WAY, WE DO NOT JUST STAND UP FOR THESE VALUES HERE AT HOME. WE STAND UP FOR THEM EVERYWHERE. THAT IS WHY I TRAVELED THE WORLD NONSTOP OR FOUR YEARS AS SECRETARY OF STATE, CALLING FOR EQUAL RIGHTS FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS, FOR LGBT PEOPLE.  FOR RELIGIOUS MINORITIES, OR ALL OF OPPRESSED PEOPLE BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BEACON OF HOPE TO THE WORLD, AND WE NEED TO KEEP THAT LIGHT SHINING FOR ALL TO SEE. THAT IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A DEMOCRAT. THOSE ARE THE VALUES WE CHERISH. IF IS TIME TO STAND TOGETHER AND DEFEND THOSE VALUES. BECAUSE OTHERS ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY IN A VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION. WHO WATCHED THE REPUBLICAN DEBATE A FEW WEEKS AGO? 17 CANDIDATES, ALL TRYING TO OUTDO EACH OTHER IN THEIR IDEOLOGICAL PURITY. ALL EITHER OBLIVIOUS TO HOW THEIR IDEAS WOULD HURT PEOPLE, OR JUST NOT INTERESTED. NOT ONE OF THEM HAD A SINGLE WORD TO SAY ABOUT HOW TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE. NOT A WORD ABOUT EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN OR PAID FAMILY LEAVE OR QUALITY, AFFORDABLE SCHOOL FOR OUR KIDS SO THEY CAN GET THE BEST START IN LIFE NO SOLUTIONS FOR SKYROCKETING PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. NO PROMISES TO END THE ERA OF MASS INCARCERATION, OR SAY CLEARLY AND LOUDLY BLACK LIVES MATTER.  I DID NOT HEAR ANY CREDIBLE PLAN TO PROMOTE CLEAN ENERGY OR COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE. AND NO ONE IS STANDING UP AND SAYING WHAT WE ALL KNOW TO BE TRUE. WE NEED TO PUT AN END TO THE GUN VIOLENCE THAT PLAGUES OUR COMMUNITIES.  YOU KNOW, AFTER THE TERRIBLE EVENTS OF WEDNESDAY, WITH TWO JOURNALISTS KILLED ON LIVE TELEVISION, PLUS A POLICE OFFICER KILLED IN LOUISIANA, AND MANY MORE LOST EVERY DAY IN CARNAGE THAT LARGELY GOES UNNOTICED NOW ACROSS OUR COUNTRY, I DO NOT KNOW HOW ANYONE COULD NOT COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT SOMETHING IS DEEPLY WRONG. I BELIEVE WE CAN HAVE COMMON SENSE GUN REFORM THAT KEEP WEAPONS OUT OF THE HANDS THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN, DOMESTIC ABUSERS, THE VIOLENTLY UNSTABLE, WHILE RESPECTING THE RIGHTS OF RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS ARE I KNOW POLITICS ARE HARD. I KNOW THAT SOME WOULD RATHER THROW UP THEIR HANDS OR GIVE UP THE FIGHT. BUT NOT ME. I AM NOT GOING TO SIT BY WERE MORE PEOPLE DIE ACROSS AMERICA.  REPUBLICANS DO NOT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT ANY OF THESE THINGS. THEIR FLAMBOYANT FRONT RUNNER HAS GRABBED A LOT OF ATTENTION LATELY AND BUT IF YOU LOOK AT EVERYONE ELSE'S POLICIES, THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME. THEY ARE TRYING WITHOUT THE PIZZAZZ OR THE HAIR.  A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT MY HAIR OVER THE YEARS.  I DO KIND OF KNOW WHAT DONALD IS GOING THROUGH.  AND IF ANYONE WONDERS IF MINE IS REAL, HERE IS THE ANSWER. THE HAIR IS REAL, THE COLOR IS NOT.   AND COME TO THINK OF IT, I WONDER IF THAT IS TRUE FOR DONALD AS WELL.  YOU HEAR MR. TRUMP SAY HATEFUL THINGS ABOUT IMMIGRANTS, EVEN ABOUT THEIR BABIES. HOW MANY OTHERS DISAGREE WITH HIM, OR SUPPORT A REAL PLAN FOR CITIZENSHIP OR DRAW THE LINE AT REPEALING THE 14TH AMENDMENT? TODAY THE PARTY OF LINCOLN HAS BECOME THE PARTY OF TRUNK. THINK ABOUT IT. NOW OF COURSE, MR. TRUMP ALSO INSULTS AND DISMISSES WOMEN, AND BY THE WAY, JUST YESTERDAY HE ATTACKED ME JUST ONCE AGAIN. AND SAID I DO NOT HAVE A CLUE ABOUT WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES. REALLY?  YOU CANNOT MAKE THIS STUFF UP. TRUMP ACTUALLY SAYS HE WOULD DO A MUCH BETTER JOB FOR WOMEN THAN I WOULD THAT IS A GENERAL ELECTION DEBATE THAT IS GOING TO BE A LOTS OF FUN.  BUT LISTEN TO THE OTHERS. SENATOR RUBIO BRAGGED ABOUT THE NINE REPENTANCE OF -- NINE VICTIMS OF RAPE AND INCENSED -- ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN PROTECTED BY AN HIV TEST. ALL OF THE STUFF THEY ARE SAYING MIGHT BE RED MEAT IN PUBLIC AND PRIMARY, BUT IT IS DEAD WRONG IN 21ST-CENTURY AMERICA.  AND I KNOW THAT WHEN I TALK LIKE THIS SOME PEOPLE THINK THERE SHE GOES AGAIN WITH THE WOMEN'S ISSUES. REPUBLICANS SAY I AM PLAYING THE GENDER CARD.  IF CALLING FOR EQUAL PAY AND PAID LEAVE AND WOMEN'S HEALTH IS PLAYING THE GENDER CARD, DEAL ME IN.  SO, MY FRIENDS. WE DEMOCRATS ARE NOT GOING TO SIT IDLY BY WHILE REPUBLICANS SHAME AND BLAME WOMEN. WE ARE NOT WE JUST A QUIET WHEN THEY DEMONIZE IMMIGRANTS WHO WHETHER THEY ARE LATINO, ASIAN, OR ANYTHING ELSE WE ARE NOT WITH YOU SILENT WHEN THEY SAY CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT REAL, OR SAME-SEX COUPLES ARE THREATENING OUR FREEDOM, OR TRACK AN -- TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS WORKS. WE CANNOT LET THEM TAKE US BACKWARDS FROM THIS WEIRD WOULD FIGHT, AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN. IT IS NO SECRET THAT WE'RE GOING UP AGAINST SOME PRETTY POWERFUL FORCES WHO WILL PAY, DO COME AND SPEND WHATEVER IT TAKES TO ADVANCE THEIR OUT OF TOUCH AND OUT OF DATE AGENDA. AS FAR AS THEY ARE CONCERNED, IF OUR DEMOCRACY PAYS THE PRICE, SO BE IT. WE HAVE LIVED THROUGH THIS BEFORE. THE ROBBER BARONS OF THE LATE 19TH CENTURY HAD A PUBLIC OFFICIAL'S BAGS OF CASH. NOW WE HAVE SEEK IT -- SECRET, UNACCOUNTABLE MONEY THAT DISTORTS OUR ELECTIONS AND DROWNS OUT THE VOICES OF EVERYDAY AMERICANS. WE NEED JUSTICES ON THE SUPREME COURT WHO WILL PROTECT EVERY CITIZEN'S RIGHT TO VOTE.  INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING, PROTECTING EVERY CORPORATION'S RIGHT TO BUY ELECTIONS. IF NECESSARY I WILL PASS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO UNDO CITIZENS UNITED.  SO MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY, YOU KNOW THAT AND I KNOW THAT. BUT I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR FAMILIES AND UNDERDOGS MY ENTIRE LIFE. I'M NOT GOING TO STOP NOW. IN FACT, I'M JUST GETTING WARMED UP.  I AM HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR HELP. I'M NOT TAKING A SINGLE PRIMARY VOTER OR CAUCUS GOER FOR GRANTED. I BUILDING AN ORGANIZATION OF ALL 50 STATES AND TERRITORIES, WITH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEERS WHO WILL HELP DEMOCRATS WIN RACES UP AND DOWN THE TICKET, NOT JUST A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.  LOOK, IN 2010, REPUBLICANS ROUTED US ON REDISTRICTING. NOT BECAUSE THEY WON CONGRESS, BUT BECAUSE THEY WON STATE LEGISLATURES. LOOK WHERE WE ARE NOW. WE CANNOT EVER LET THAT HAPPEN AGAIN. IT IS TIME TO REBUILD OUR PARTY FROM THE GROUND UP, AND IF YOU MAKE ME THE NOMINEE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WILL DO.  I'VE BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW EVERY COUNTY AND LOCAL OFFICE COUNSELING EVERY SCHOOL BOARD AND STATEHOUSE, AND SENATE SEAT COUNTS. EVERY SINGLE ONE, SO WE HAVE TO COMPETE EVERYWHERE. WHEN OUR STATE PARTIES ARE STRONG WE WIN. THAT IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN. AND WHEN DEMOCRATS WIN IN AMERICA WINS AND SO I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN ME BECAUSE WE ARE BUILDING SOMETHING THAT WILL LAST LONG AFTER NEXT NOVEMBER.  I WANT TO BE PRESIDENT TO TAKE ON THE BIG PROBLEMS THAT FILL OUR SCREENS EVERY DAY AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD OTHER CANDIDATES MAY BE FIGHTING FOR A PARTICULAR IDEOLOGY, BUT I'M FIGHTING OR YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES ARE I WILL TAKE ON THE KINDS OF PROBLEM'S THAT KEEP PEOPLE UP AT NIGHT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO WORK IF YOU CANNOT FIND ANYONE TO WATCH HER KIDS? WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU LOSE THAT JOB YOU WORKED SO HARD TO FIND? WHERE CAN YOU TURN WHEN THAT BUT LOVED ONE WHO IS BATTLING ADDICTION OR STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS FINALLY ONCE HELP? ALL OF THE CHALLENGE THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS DEAL EVERY DAY THAT THEY TALK TO ME ABOUT. CHALLENGES OUR LEADERS SHOULD CARE ABOUT BUT DO NOT NEARLY GOOD ENOUGH ATTENTION. I'M PAYING ATTENTION. I HEAR YOU. I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT TO FIGHT THOSE FIGHTS, TO FIGHT FOR EVERY AMERICAN EVERY DAY. TO FIGHT FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. LET ME SAY AT THE END HERE THAT I AM A PROUD NEW GRANDMOTHER. AN 11-MONTH-OLD EXTRAORDINARY GRANDDAUGHTER. AND OBVIOUSLY HER PARENTS AND BILL AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE SHE HAS EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE HER DREAMS. BUT YOU KNOW, THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. BECAUSE WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY AND WORLD WILL SHE GROW UP TO LIVE IN? THAT ALL OF AMERICA'S CHILDREN WILL LIVE IN? YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A ORMER PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY OF STATE SUCCEED IN AMERICA. I WANT THE GRANDDAUGHTERS OF FACTORY WORKERS AND GRANDSONS OF FARMWORKERS TO HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME CHANCE. LET'S KEEP WORKING WITH ALL OUR HEARTS TOWARD A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. THEY DESERVE TO LIVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE EVERYONE HAS A SHOT AT ACHIEVING THEIR DREAMS. WHERE EVERYONE GETS TO LIVE UP TO THEIR POTENTIAL. AND YES, WHERE A FATHER CAN SAY TO HIS DAUGHTER, YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT, EVEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU. GOD BLESS YOU.

I REMEMBER COMING HERE WHEN YOU WERE GOVERNOR AND TALKING TO YOU . YOU WERE TALKING TO ME ABOUT WIND POWER AND SHOWING ME THE FIRST WINDMILLS GOING UP AND HOW YOU HAD FOCUSED ON THE STATE GOVERNMENT, AND THE BUSINESSES OF IOWA TO SEE THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS THE CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY. LEADERSHIP MATTERS. LEADERSHIP THAT PRODUCES RESULTS AND THAT HAS A VISION, AND THE FOLLOW TO REALIZE THE VISION. IT IS A GREAT PERSONAL PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH TOM BUT IT IS A PROFESSIONAL ONE BECAUSE THE LEADERSHIP HE PROVIDED ON THE ISSUES I WAS TALKING ABOUT IN MY AGENDA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK WE ARE TO TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. HELLO KATHY.  YOU ARE RIGHT. TRADE IS ESSENTIAL FOR AMERICAN AGRICULTURE. NO PLACE KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN IOWA. IN THE OVERVIEW THAT I GAVE, MY PROPOSAL, I SAID THAT WE NEED TRADE. WE NEED TRADE THAT NEEDS THE THREE CRITERIA I HAVE LAID OUT. PROTECT AMERICAN JOBS, IT GROWS THE ECONOMY, AND IT ADVANCES OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. THAT IS WHY IM FOCUSED ON LOOKING FOR HOW WE MAKE TRADE WORK FOR ALL ASPECTS OF OUR ECONOMY. I AM WELL AWARE OF HOW CRITICAL TRADE IS FOR AMERICAN AGRICULTURE. I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE SURE REGARDLESS OF WHAT TRADE AGREEMENTS WE HAVE, AMERICAN FARMERS GET A GOOD SHOT AT NEW MARKETS AND NEW OPPORTUNITIES. I THINK WE WILL HAVE SOME WAYS OF DOING THAT. IN MY LONGER DESCRIPTION OF THESE POLICIES YOU CAN SEE MORE ABOUT WHAT I MEAN. HOW ARE YOU JOE? I HAVE NOT SEEN YOU FOR A WHILE.  LET ME START BY SAYING VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN IS A FRIEND OF MINE. WE WERE COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE. I WORKED WITH HIM AS FIRST LADY. I WORKED WITH HIM IN PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FIRST TERM. I HAD A GREAT DEAL OF ADMIRATION AND OF ACTION FOR HIM. I THINK HE HAS TO MAKE WHAT IS A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY. HE SHOULD HAVE THE SPACE AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. I'M GOING TO BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT REGARDLESS, AND CONTINUING TO PUT FORTH MY POLICIES. I WAS PROUD TO BE A MEMBER OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CABINET. I ALSO HAVE IDEAS WHERE I WANT TO GO NOT JUST BUILD ON WHAT WAS DONE BUT GO BEYOND. I WILL BE LAYING THAT OUT. I ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A COMPETITIVE CAMPAIGN. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SHOULD HAVE NOT OTHERWISE. I'M GOING TO RUN AS HARD AS I CAN TO CONVINCE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE TO SUPPORT ME AND EARN ALL THE VOTES I CAN IN THE CAUCUSES AND PRIMARIES. I HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE OF THAT BUT WE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DECIDED TO DO IT. I'M GOING TO KEEP RUNNING MY CAMPAIGN AND DOING WHAT I BELIEVE IS NECESSARY TO MAKE THE CASE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT MY E-MAIL USE AS SECRETARY OF STATE AND UNDERSTAND WHY. I GET IT. HERE IS WHAT I WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO KNOW. MY USE OF PERSONAL E-MAIL WAS ALLOWED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT. IT CLEARLY WASN'T THE BEST CHOICE. I SHOULD HAVE USED TO E-MAILS, ONE PERSONAL, ONE FOR WORK. I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT DECISION. I WANT TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE, WHICH IS WHY I TURNED OVER 55,000 PAGES, WHY I TURNED OVER MY SERVER. WHY I HAVE AGREED TO -- AND BEEN ASKING TO TASH -- TO TESTIFY IN OCTOBER. I'M CONFIDENT THIS PROCESS WILL PROVE I NEVER SENT NOR RECEIVED ANY E-MAIL THAT WAS MARKED CLASSIFIED AREA I'M GOING TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TALK TO ME ABOUT. AND TO LAY OUT MY PLANS FOR WHAT I WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT TO MAKE THE ECONOMY WERE, TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE, TO GET THE COST OF DRUGS DOWN, AND GET EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN, AND THE ISSUES THAT ARE AT THE CORE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.  I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER THAT. I JUST WANT THE VICE PRESIDENT TO DECIDE TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR HIM AND HIS FAMILY. I DON'T THINK IT IS USEFUL TO BE BEHIND THE SCENES ASKING THIS OR SAYING THAT. I JUST WANT HIM TO REACH WHATEVER HE THINKS THE RIGHT DECISION IS. HE HAS TO DO THAT. IT HAS TO BE A REALLY HARD ONE. I WAS AT HIS SON'S FUNERAL. I CANNOT IMAGINE THE GRIEF AND THE HEARTBREAK. JOE HAS HAD MORE TERRIBLE EVENTS THAN MOST PEOPLE CAN EVEN CONTEMPLATE. LOSING HIS FIRST WIFE, HIS FIRST DAUGHTER. NOW LOSING HIS SON. HE HAS TO DO WHAT HE HAS TO DO. I'M GOING TO CONTINUE WITH MY CAMPAIGN AND DO WHAT I BELIEVE I SHOULD BE DOING. HE WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT HE SHOULD BE DOING. REPORTER:   THANK YOU.  FIRST OF ALL. I WAS SO STRICKEN TO THINK THAT THESE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE DOING THE WORK THAT YOU GUYS DO EVERY DAY WOULD BE MURDERED ON LIVE TELEVISION. AND I WILL EXTEND MY CONDOLENCES AND SYMPATHY TO THEIR FAMILIES AND COWORKERS, AND PRAY FOR THE WOMAN WHO LEFT -- LAST I CHECKED WAS STILL IN GOOD CRITICAL CONDITION. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA. I WILL TAKE IT ON. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO FACE IT AND KNOW IT, BUT THEN TURN AWAY BECAUSE IT IS HARD. IT IS A POLITICAL, DIFFICULT ISSUE. I BELIEVE WE ARE SMART ENOUGH, COMPASSIONATE ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BALANCE THE LEGITIMATE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS WITH PREVENTIVE MEASURES AND CONTROL MEASURES SO THAT WHATEVER MOTIVATED THIS MURDERER , WHO EVENTUALLY TOOK HIS OWN LIFE, WE WILL NOT SEE MORE DEATH, NEEDLESS, SENSELESS DEATH. I FEEL GREAT HEARTACHE AT WHAT HAPPENED, AND I WANT TO REITERATE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS WE NOT LET YET ANOTHER TERRIBLE INSTANCE GO BY WITHOUT TRYING TO DO SOMETHING MORE TO PREVENT THIS INCREDIBLE KILLING THAT IS STOCKING OUR COUNTRY. -- STALKING OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE SO MANY INSTANCES OF IT BUT IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY, INTENTIONAL, UNINTENTIONAL, MURDERERS, SUICIDES. IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY. IF GUNS WERE NOT SO READILY AVAILABLE, IF WE HAD IT UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS, IF WE COULD PUT SOME TIMEOUT BETWEEN THE PERSON WHO IS UPSET BECAUSE HE WEARS FIRE OR THE DOMESTIC OF USE, OR WHATEVER MOTIVATION MAY BE WORKING ON SOMEONE WHO DOES THIS, MAYBE WE COULD PREVENT THIS KIND OF CARNAGE. I HOPE THAT IN ADDITION TO EXPRESSING SYMPATHY TO THOSE DIRECTLY AFFECTED, MAYBE FOR THE MEDIA, PUBLIC, ELECTED OFFICIALS , WHAT IT HOPEFULLY WILL FINALLY TAKE FOR US TO ACT.","Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton News Conference in Ankeny, Iowa"

REMARKS FROM THIS PAST WEEKEND. FIRST UP, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON. THEN, BERNIE SANDERS. HILLARY CLINTON: THE FACTS OF THE SAME FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THESE QUESTIONS BEING RAISED. MOST IMPORTANTLY, I HAVE A SENSE OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION -- I NEVER RECEIVED ANY. I WILL LET WHATEVER THIS INQUIRY IS TO GO FORWARD, AND WILL AWAIT THE OUTCOMES OF IT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS CONFIRMED WHAT I JUST SAID TO YOU. I DO THINK THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, THERE IS AN UNFORTUNATE TENDENCY TO TRY TO MAKE PARTISAN AND TRAGEDY IN BENGHAZI. I FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE WITH IT AND DO NOT THINK IT IS RIGHT. I WILL NOT PARTICIPATE. WE WILL SEE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT. WHEN I TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY, IT IS NEVER RAISED IN MY TOWN HALLS OR OTHER MEETINGS WITH PEOPLE. I THINK WHAT PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN IS WHAT SENATOR HARKIN SAID, WHO WILL GET THE ECONOMY MOVING, WHO WILL GET THE COST OF CHALLENGE DOWN, WHO WILL OPEN UP THE WORKFORCE TO WOMEN, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, AND SO MUCH MORE. IT IS WHAT I TALK ABOUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.  COULD YOU REPEAT THAT?  I'M SAYING THE WEIGHT IT HAS BEEN USED DURING THE STATE DEPARTMENT DID CONFIRM THAT I DID NOT SEND OR RECEIVE ANY MATERIAL MARKED CLASSIFIED. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT ME.  THAT IS SOMETHING THEY WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE. I THINK THERE ARE DISPUTES AMONGST AGENCIES ABOUT WHAT COULD HAVE, SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE. THAT IS SOMETHING FOR THEM TO WORK OUT. I DID NOT SEND NO RECEIVE MATERIAL MARKED CLASSIFIED.  I HAVE STATED -- I FIND IT CURIOUS THAT JEB BUSH IS DOUBLING DOWN ON HIS SPENDING OF HIS BROTHER'S ACTIONS IN IRAQ. IF HE'S GOING TO DO THAT, HE NEEDS TO PRESENT THE ENTIRE PICTURE IT INCLUDES THE AGREEMENT IN IRAQ THAT SET THE END OF 2011 TO A DRAW TROOPS. I CAN ONLY WONDER WHETHER HE JUST DID NOT KNOW THAT, OR THOUGHT THAT OTHER PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE REMINDED OF THAT. IT IS FOR HIM TO MAKE WHATEVER HE WISHES OF THE CAMPAIGN. THERE IS A JOINT LINE BETWEEN THE AGREEMENT THAT GEORGE BUSH SIGNED, AND THE EFFORT THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION MADE, WHICH I WAS A PART, THAT PERSUADED BE MALIKI GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE AMERICAN SUPPORT FOR THE IRAQI ARMY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INVESTMENT IN TRAINING WOULD PAY OFF. MALIKI DID NOT WANT A CONTINUING AMERICAN PRESENCE. I THINK WHAT IS BEING DONE WITH RESPECT TO ISIS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. THE SUPPORT UNITED STATES IS NOW PROVIDING TO THE IRAQI ARMY TO RETRAIN, BECAUSE OF WHAT MALIKI DID TO REALLY START TO A ERODE ITS ABILITIES. THIS HAS TO BE AN IRAQI LED MISSION. LIKE ANYBODY WHO HAS FOLLOWED THE HORRIFIC AND BARBARIC BEHAVIOR OF ISIS, I AM VERY COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING THE EFFORTS WITHIN THE REGION TO TRY TO TAKE ON THE THREAT THAT THEY POSE TO EVERYONE, BUT PARTICULARLY TO WOMEN, AND ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF CERTAIN RELIGIOUS BACKGROUNDS. IT IS AN AREA THAT IS SO DEEPLY DISTRESSING TO READ ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON THERE. I THINK WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO GET THE REGION TOGETHER TO DRIVE ISIS OUT OF THE TERRITORY THAT THEY OCCUPY TO RESCUE THE PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE, PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN. I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA IS DOING WHAT HE CAN TO BRING THAT ABOUT. >> HOW DO YOU ASSESS THE REPUBLICAN FIELD? DID YOU EVER EXPECT TO SEE DONALD TRUMP ON TOP OF THE LIST?  I AM JUST HAVING A GOOD TIME. IT IS MOSTLY FOR ME A CONTINUING CONVERSATION WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I'M ENJOYING IT, GETTING A LOT OUT OF IT, LEARNING A LOT. I WILL GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE OF WHY I FIND THIS SO PERSONALLY REWARDING. YESTERDAY, A WOMAN SAID SHE WAS THERE BECAUSE I TALKED ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH. THE REASON I TALKED ABOUT UNTIL HEALTH IS BECAUSE FOUR MONTHS AGO AND IOWA, PEOPLE TALK TO ME ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH. I WANT TO HAVE THIS CONTINUING CONVERSATION OF WHAT IS ON THE MINDS OF AMERICANS. I WILL FIGHT AS HARD AS I CAN TO EARN EVERY VOTE, HERE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  SENATOR HARKIN IS THERE, WITH A HAT.  HE IS REALLY INTO THIS. MY HUSBAND WENT WITH HIM TO THE BELMONT STAKES. AMERICAN PHARAOH WON, SO EXCITING.  HOW ARE YOU? NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. NICE TO SEE YOU.  YOU KNOW, I KNEW VERY WELL JOHN SISTER. WE HAD SO MUCH FUN TOGETHER. OH MY GOSH.

IT WAS SUCH A HONOR -- SHE AND I USED TO RUN A POT LUCK TOGETHER WHEN WE WERE LIVING IN FAYETTEVILLE. WE WOULD HAVE A LITTLE POTLUCK. IT WAS LIKE SOMETHING SHE BROUGHT FROM IOWA.

THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH.  TAKE CARE. >>   >> AND SIX GENERATION -- I AM SIX GENERTH GENERATION.  HOW FAR BACK DOES THAT GO?  IT IS SO WONDERFUL TO HAVE THE CHANCE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK. >>   TELL ME, HOW OLD IS SHE? , SHE IS THREE. SHE HAS EPILEPSY. SHE IS ON THE FEEDING TUBE. SHE IS NOT EXPECTED TO LIVE VERY LONG.

DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HILLARY CLINTON LAID DOWN A PLAN TO ADDRESS U.S. STUDENT LOAN DEBT. SHE SPOKE TO REPORTERS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL AND THE 2016 RACE. HILLARY CLINTON: WELCOME TO EXETER. I WANT TO SAY MY THOUGHTS ARE ONCE AGAIN WITH THE PEOPLE OF FERGUSON AS THEY MARK THIS PAINFUL ANNIVERSARY. AND IN LIGHT OF THE CONTINUING VIOLENCE THAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT, VIOLENCE HAS NO PLACE IN OUR STREETS. AND WE SHOULD ALL BE WORKING FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE AS THEIR AND EVERYWHERE IN OUR COUNTRY. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE TWO QUICK POINTS AND TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. FIRST, IN ANNOUNCING MY PLAN TO PUT COLLEGE WITHIN REACH FOR EVERYONE, THE NEW COLLEGE COMPACT, I AM EMPHASIZING THE 2 PARTS. NO FAMILY AND NO STUDENT SHOULD HAVE TO BORROW TO PAY TUITION AT A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY AND EVERYONE WHO HAS STUDENT DEBT SHOULD BE ABLE TO REFINANCE IT AT LOWER RATES, COSTS NOT A BARRIER, AND THAT WILL NOT HOLD YOU BACK UNDER MY PLAN. I WANTED TO MAKE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE BECAUSE STUDENTS CARRY ONE OF THE HIGHEST DEBT BURDENS, NEARLY $33,000 FOR AVERAGE GRADUATES ALL FOUR-YEAR COLLEGES BUT MUCH -- OF FOUR-YEAR COLLEGES BUT MUCH MORE AS WE HEARD FROM THE LAST YOUNG MAN I CALLED ON. THE COST OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE HERE IS NEARLY TWICE WHAT IS PAID NEXT DOOR IN MAINE. THE HOUSE AND SENATE IS WORKING TO REVERSE THE DRAMATIC DECLINE IN STATE INVESTMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION THAT THEY SHIFTED THE COST OF STUDENTS AT FAMILIES BUT IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TO BE A PARTNER IN MOVING THIS COMPACT FORWARD. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO DISCUSSING THIS FURTHER TOMORROW AND NEXT WEEK IN IOWA. SECOND, I WANT TO ADD MY VOICE TO THOSE WHO'VE EXPRESSED OUTRAGE AND DISAPPOINTMENT ABOUT THE DECISION LAST WEEK BY THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL TO CUT OFF FUNDING FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. IT IS APPALLING THAT THREE MEN SITTING IN THE CHAMBERS OF THE COUNCIL WOULD DENY WOMEN ACROSS THE STATE THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED AND DESERVE. IT SHOWS YET AGAIN WHY WE NEED MORE LEADERS LIKE GOVERNOR HASSAN AND SENATOR SHAHEEN WHO WILL STAND UP FOR WOMEN. AND JUST HOW OUT OF TOUCH AND OUT OF DATE REPUBLICAN LEADERS ARE. THIS IS WHAT WE SAW AT THE DEBATE ON THURSDAY. NONE OF THE CANDIDATES OFFER SOLUTIONS FOR HOW TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE OR RAISE INCOMES FOR HARD-WORKING FAMILIES. THEY DO NOT TALK ABOUT THE REAL PRESSURES FACING AMERICAN FAMILIES. WHILE WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID ABOUT MEGYN KELLY IS OUTRAGEOUS, WHAT THE REST OF THE REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING ABOUT ALL WOMEN IS ALSO OUTRAGEOUS. THEY BRAG ABOUT SLASHING WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE FUNDING AND SAY THEY WOULD FORCE WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN RAPED TO CARRY THEIR RAPISTS' CHILD AND WE DO NOT HEAR ANY OF THEM TALKING ABOUT RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE, ACCESS TO QUALITY CHILD CARE, EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN, OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT WILL HELP TO GIVE WOMEN A CHANCE TO GET AHEAD. MEGYN KELLY IS A STRONG WOMAN AND MORE THAN CAPABLE OF DEFENDING HERSELF AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. I AM WORRIED ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN POLICIES WOULD DO TO THE REST OF AMERICA WOMEN AND I WILL SPEAK OUT ABOUT THAT TODAY AND THROUGH THE REST OF THIS CAMPAIGN AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WITH THAT -- >>     I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO DEBATING FIRST OF MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE AND THEN FINALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO DEBATE THE REPUBLICANS ABOUT WHAT EVER THEIR NOMINEE HAS TO SAY. I WILL SHOW UP FOR THE DEBATES AS THEY ARE SCHEDULED AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A ROBUST, GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO EXCHANGE VIEWS WITH MY FELLOW CANDIDATES.  AND -- I AM NOT GOING TO GET INTO SCHEDULING. I WILL JUST SHOW UP. WHEN I AM TOLD, I WILL SHOW UP AND LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.  I WILL LEAVE MY COMMENTS WHERE THEY ARE. I THOUGHT WHAT HE SAID WAS OFFENSIVE AND I CERTAINLY THINK THAT IT DESERVES THE KIND OF REACTION IT IS GETTING FROM SO MANY OTHERS. IF WE FOCUS ON THAT, WE ARE MAKING A MISTAKE. WHAT A LOT OF THE MEN ON THAT STAGE AND DEBATE SAID WAS OFFENSIVE. I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU JUST FOCUS ON MAYBE THE BIGGEST SHOWMAN ON THE STAGE, YOU LOSE THE THREAD HERE. THE THREAD IS THE REPUBLICANS ARE PUTTING FORTH SOME VERY RADICAL AND OFFENSIVE POSITIONS WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN'S LIVES, WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, WOMEN'S EMPLOYMENT, WOMEN'S OPPORTUNITY. WE WILL LET THE REPUBLICANS GO BACK AND FORTH WITH EACH OTHER. I WANT TO POINT OUT THERE IS NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE POLICIES THEY ARE HAVING FOR AMERICAN WOMEN. >>   I CONSIDER HIM A FRIEND. WE WERE COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE. I HAVE THE HIGHEST REGARD AND AFFECTION FOR HIM. I SPOKE TO HIM AT HIS SON'S FUNERAL. WE SHOULD ALL JUST LET THE VICE PRESIDENT THE WEST HAS FAMILY -- LET THE VICE PRESIDENT BE WITH HIS FAMILY AND MAKE WHATEVER DECISION HE BELIEVES IS RIGHT FOR HIM. AND I WILL RESPECT WHATEVER IT IS.  WELL, THE REPUBLICANS GET TO CHOOSE THEIR NOMINEE AND THEY GET TO MAKE THAT DECISION. WHEN ONE OF THEIR MAJOR CANDIDATES, A MUCH YOUNGER MAN, THE SENATOR FROM FLORIDA SAID THERE SHOULD BE NO EXCEPTION FOR RAPE AND INCEST, THAT IS AS TROUBLING AS YOU CAN HEAR FROM A MAJOR CANDIDATE RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY. THE LANGUAGE MAY BE MORE COLORFUL AND OFFENSIVE BUT THE THINKING AND THE ATTITUDE TOWARD WOMEN IS VERY MUCH THE SAME. IT IS DELIVERED IN A DIFFERENT PACKAGE. I DO NOT WANT PEOPLE TO BE CONFUSED HERE ABOUT OUTRAGEOUS COMMENTS BY ONE AND SAY WE'RE FOCUSED ON THIS AND GOING TO LET RAPE AND INCEST GO ON A MENTIONED. I AM NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN.  I SAID IT WAS OFFENSIVE AND OUTRAGEOUS, AND I STAND BY IT. MORE PEOPLE SHOULD SAY THE SAME. MORE PEOPLE SHOULD GO AFTER HIM. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH HIM. I WANT TO REMIND US THAT WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT WOMEN, NOT A ONE WOMAN WAS PERFECTLY CAPABLE AND INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF, BUT ALL OF THESE WOMEN THAT I HAVE FOUGHT FOR AND WORKED FOR INSTEAD OF FOR AND ADVOCATED FOR AND WANT TO BE A PRESIDENT FOR WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. WHO MAY LOSE THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE A PERSONAL CHOICE. IT IS CERTAIN IF THE REPUBLICANS WERE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. I DO NOT WANT THAT FORGOTTEN. YES, IT MAKES A GREAT TV. THE GUY WENT WAY OVERBOARD. BUT WHAT MARCO RUBIO SAID HAS AS MUCH OF AN IMPACT IN TERMS OF WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS TODAY AS ANYBODY ELSE ON THAT STAGE. IT IS DEEPLY TROUBLING AND SHOULD BE TO THE PRESS AND NOT JUST TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN DOING THE WORK FOR SO LONG.  I DO NOT KNOW HIM THAT WELL. I KNEW HIM. I HAPPEN TO BE PLANNING TO BE IN FLORIDA AT IT WOULD BE FUN TO GO TO HIS WEDDING BECAUSE IT IS ALWAYS ENTERTAINING. NOW THAT HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, IT IS MORE TROUBLING.  NOT AT ALL. I WAS PROUD TO BE ENDORSED BY THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. I HAVE BEEN PROUD TO WORK WITH HER NURSES FOR MANY, MANY YEARS ON HEALTH CARE AND BETTER TREATMENT FOR NURSES. I AM A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR NURSES AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM WHEN I AM PRESIDENT.  NICK IS THE MAN. I HAVE TO LET NICK DOES WHAT HE -- DO WHAT HE DOES. THAT IS HIS JOB. OK, GUYS.  OH, REALLY? WHAT DOES DONALD TRUMP HAVE TO SAY ABOUT COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY?  YES, YES. RIGHT. >>   FIRST OF ALL, THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE A CAMPAIGN. IT WILL BE AT THE CENTER OF MY CAMPAIGN. I HOPE PEOPLE RUNNING FOR CONGRESS WILL LATCH ON TO IT. I WANT TO GET MORE DEMOCRATS ELECTED AND THAT WOULD BE A BIG HELP. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WHAT I AM ADVOCATING AS WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA ADVOCATED GOES BACK TO WHAT PRESIDENT REAGAN. THE STATUS UNDER PRESIDENT REAGAN. I WANTED THEM TO HAVE TO ANSWER TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHY THEY DO NOT WANT TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE. THIS HAS TO BE A CHOICE. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS SETTING UP OUR SIDE OF THE CHOICE AND A PROPOSAL I AM MAKING AND I AM GOING TO BE LOOKING TO SEE WHAT THEIR RESPONSES AND LET'S HAVE AN ELECTION. AN ELECTION ABOUT REAL CHOICES THAT WILL AFFECT PEOPLE'S LIVES. THAT IS WHAT I AM INTERESTED IN. AND ONCE I GET TO THE WHITE HOUSE, I WILL DO WHAT I HAVE ALWAYS DONE AND I WORK ACROSS THE AISLE WITH SENATORS AND REPUBLICANS. I WILL WORK VERY, VERY HARD TO PUT TOGETHER THE VOTES NEEDED TO GET THIS PAST. -- THIS PASSED. I THINK IT WILL BE HUGE CONSTITUENCY FOR IT. WHAT?  WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ELECTION. I DO NOT KNOW IF WE WILL HEAR IT YET. SOME OF WHAT REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO DO IS VERY CONNECTED TO MY PLAN. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT SENATOR ALEXANDER HAS BEEN ADVOCATING, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR IDEAS FOR REPUBLICANS AS WELL AS DEMOCRATS. THAT IS WHAT I GET THOUGHTS -- THAT IS WHERE I GET THOUGHTS ABOUT RISKSHARING. IF YOU PRETEND TO EDUCATE PEOPLE AND THEY'RE NOT EMPLOYABLE, YOU HAVE TO PAY A PRICE FOR IT. SENATOR ALEXANDER, I THINK HE AND I WOULD HAVE A GREAT CONVERSATION ABOUT IT. HE HAS TO DO WHAT HE HAS TO BETWEEN NOW AND THE ELECTION. THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER. THANK YOU ALL.

THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.   THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I THOUGHT DAN DID A GREAT JOB. AND THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING FOR SO MANY OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELVES MORE HARD-WORKING AND DEDICATED AND DESERVE TO GO AS FAR AS THE THAT AMBITION AND EFFORT OF YOURS WILL TAKE YOU. WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR SISTER, AND THE OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. LET ME THANK REPRESENTATIVE ALEXIS SIMPSON FOR HER INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.   I LOVED IT WHEN SHE SAID I AM A STATE REPRESENTATIVE, A MOM WITH 2 BOYS AND I JUST PAID OFF MY STUDENT LOAN. I KNOW THAT IS TRUE FOR SO MANY YOUNG COUPLES AND FAMILIES. AND WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES BUT WE DO NOT WANT IT TO BE SO HARD THAT THE DEBT THEY CARRY INTERFERES WITH THEM ABLE TO START A SMALL BUSINESS OR BUY A HOME OR GET MARRIED WHICH UNFORTUNATELY IS THE CASE TODAY. I WANTED TO RECOGNIZE STATE REP PATTY LOVEJOY. WILL YOU STAND UP? THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.   AND EXECUTIVE COUNSELOR OSTERN. WHERE IS COLLIN? HE WORKS ON BEHALF OF THE ISSUES. GREAT TO BE BACK IN EXETER AND AFTER THIS EXTRAORDINARY HIGH SCHOOL. I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING ALL OVER NEW HAMPSHIRE FROM DOVER TO NASHUA TO WINDOW AND PEOPLE EVERYWHERE ASK A GREAT QUESTIONS. I THINK IT IS PARTLY BECAUSE YOU LIVE AND THE FIRST PRIMARY STATE. AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THEY ASKED ME ALL THE TIME IS ABOUT AFFORDING COLLEGE AND BEING ABLE TO PAY BACK THE LOANS THEY TAKE OUT IN ORDER TO GO TO COLLEGE. NOW, THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THE CHOICES WE MAKE AS A COUNTRY. AND THOSE CHOICES WILL SHAPE OUR FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN. I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN AMERICA, IF YOU WORK HARD AND DO YOUR PART, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. THAT'S THE BASIC BARGAIN THAT IS ALWAYS SET OUR COUNTRY APART. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE STRENGTHEN THAT BARGAIN AND IT HOLDS TRUE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION AND THE NEXT AND THE NEXT. THANKS TO THE HARD WORK OF PEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA, OUR COUNTRY HAS COME BACK FROM THE WORST RECESSION OF OUR LIFETIMES. WE ARE STANDING AGAIN BUT WE ARE NOT RUNNING THE WAY WE SHOULD. CORPORATE POCKETS ARE NEAR DEATH PROFITS ARE NEAR RECORD HIGHS BUT MOST PAYCHECKS HAVE BOUGHT -- BARELY BUDGE. COSTS FOR BASICALLY EVERYTHING HAS ALSO GONE UP. AS THEY ARE RISING FASTER THAN WAGES. NO WONDER THEN MANY AMERICANS FEEL THE DECK IS STACKED IN FAVOR OF THOSE AT THE TOP. WITH GOT TO DO BETTER AND WE HAVE TO GET INCOME RISES AGAIN SO MORE HARD-WORKING FAMILIES CAN AFFORD A MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. THAT IS THE CENTRAL ECONOMIC CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME AND IT WILL BE MY MISSION EVERY DAY THAT I SERVE AS PRESIDENT. WE NEED STRONG GROWTH.   WE NEED STRONG GROWTH, FAIR GROWTH, LONG-TERM GROWTH AND WE WANT A NEW ERA OF PROSPERITY THAT A SHARED BY ALL. WORKS FOR EVERYONE. TODAY, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS WE CAN EASE THE BURDEN ON FAMILIES. AND ONE OF THE SINGLE BIGGEST WAYS WE CAN ACTUALLY RAISE INCOME. BY MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE TO EVERY AMERICAN.   FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, A COLLEGE DEGREE HAS BEEN THE TICKET TO A BETTER LIFE. MY GRANDFATHER WORKED HIS ENTIRE LIFE AND THE LACE MILLS. HE RETIRED AT 65. HE ALWAYS BELIEVED BY WORKING THAT HARD, ALL OF THOSE HOURS THAT LIFE WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIS CHILDREN. AND MY DAD MADE IT TO COLLEGE, MADE IT TO PENN STATE. MADE IT TO THE FOOTBALL TEAM BACK IN THE 1930'S. AND THEN WHEN HE GOT OUT, HE WAS ABLE TO START HIS OWN SMALL BUSINESS. HE WORKED REALLY HARD. HE'S GRANTED HE'S SAVED AND IT MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN OUR LIVES. THEN MY PARENTS SAVED FOR YEARS FOR COLLEGE. THEY KNEW THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE WAYS THEY COULD SET TO ME ON A PATH TO A BETTER FUTURE. COLLEGE STILL HOLDS THAT PROMISE. A LOT HAS CHANGED IN THIS COUNTRY BUT THAT HASN'T. PARENTS WHO NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO GO TO COLLEGE THEMSELVES LIKE MY MOTHER DREAM OF SEEING THEIR CHILDREN GET THAT DEGREE LITERALLY FROM THE MOMENT THEY'RE BORN. THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE HOPING FOR. THEY EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION. HIGH-SCHOOLERS EVEN MIDDLE-SCHOOLERS ARE TAKING COLLEGE PREP COURSE AND SOME ARE STUDYING FOR THE SAT. FULL-TIME WORKERS ARE TAKING COURSES ONLINE, EVEN IF THAT MEANS HEADING STRAIGHT FROM AN EIGHT-HOUR SHIFT TO A PILE OF HOMEWORK. IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO GET A BETTER JOB TO GIVE THEIR KIDS BETTER THAN THEY HAD, THEN THEY'LL DO IT. BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM. STATES ARE SLASHING EDUCATION BUDGETS. AND COLLEGES KEEP RAISING PRICES. IN-STATE TUITION AND FEES FOR PUBLIC COLLEGES INCREASED BY 42% BETWEEN 2004 AND 2014. WHO'S INCOMES WERE RAISED BY 42%? SO FAMILIES ARE LEFT FACING A PAINFUL CHOICE. EITHER THEY SAY, ""WE JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT,"" AND PASS UP ON ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT A DEGREE OFFERS OR THEY DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO PAY FOR IT, EVEN IF THAT MEANS GOING DEEPLY INTO DEBT. NOW, FOR MOST PEOPLE, THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT OF A COLLEGE DEGREE IS STILL WORTH IT. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. ON AVERAGE, PEOPLE WITH FOUR-YEAR DEGREES EARN OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS MORE OVER THEIR CAREERS THAN PEOPLE WITH HIGH SCHOOL DEGREES. BUT STUDENT DEBT IS INCREASINGLY HOLDS PEOPLE BACK. 40 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE STUDENT LOANS. TOGETHER, THEY OWE $1.2 TRILLION. A NEW HAMPSHIRE CARRIES ONE OF THE HIGHEST DEBT TO LOWE'S IN THE COUNTRY. AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE DELINQUENT OR IN DEFAULT. EVEN IF THEY DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN THEY JUST CAN'T KEEP UP. ,I WAS TALKING TO SOME YOUNG PEOPLE BEFORE I CAME OUT AND ONE WAS SAYING, IT IS A REAL STRETCH. I HOPE I NEVER GET SICK. I HOPE I DO NOT GET A LAID OFF. I HOPE THERE IS NOT A FAMILY EMERGENCY. YES, PEOPLE ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO PAY THOSE LOANS BUT SOMETIMES LIFE AND FATE INTERVENED. THE COST OF THIS DEBT IS REAL AND NOT JUST ON BALANCE SHEETS, BUT IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND FUTURES. WHEN I TALK TO YOUNG PEOPLE, THEY SAY THEY PUT OFF BUYING A HOUSE OR CHANGING JOBS, OR STARTING A BUSINESS. A WOMAN CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE IN MASSACHUSETTS SO SHE COMMUTES 2 HOURS AND LIVES WITH HER PARENTS. SHE CANNOT MAKE IT WORK TO HAVE THE JOB, STARTED OFF HER CAREER AND PAYING BACK HER DAD. I'VE MET PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WHO'VE CO-SIGNED LOANS AND END UP DRAINING THEIR SAVINGS OR RUINING THEIR CREDIT BECAUSE THEY TRIED TO HELP THE NEXT GENERATION. THERE ARE STUDENTS WHO TAKE OUT LOANS TO PAY FOR AN EXPENSIVE DEGREE FROM A FOR-PROFIT INSTITUTION, ONLY TO FIND LITTLE SUPPORT ONCE THEY ACTUALLY ENROLL, OR THEY GRADUATE AND WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING THE JOB THEY WERE PROMISED, THEIR DEGREE IS NOT WORTH WHAT THEY THOUGHT. THEN THERE IS STILL TO START COLLEGE BUT NEVER FINISH. THEY'RE LEFT WITH DEBT AND NO DEGREE TO SHOW FOR IT. THE WORST OF BOTH WORLDS. OVER 40% OF COLLEGE STUDENTS STILL HAVEN'T GRADUATED AFTER SIX YEARS AND MANY NEVER DO. IT'S TIME TO SHOW SOME TOUGH LOVE TO COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THAT LET SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF STUDENTS FALL BEHIND AND DROP OUT, YEAR AFTER YEAR. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE -- COLLEGE IS SUPPOSED TO HELP PEOPLE ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS. BUT MORE AND MORE, PAYING FOR COLLEGE ACTUALLY PUSHES THOSE DREAMS FURTHER OUT OF REACH. THAT IS UP A TRAIL OF EVERYTHING COLLEGE IS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT. IT IS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT AMERICA CREATES THE GREATEST WORKFORCE AND THE WORLD IN THIS CENTURY JUST LIKE WE DID IN THE LAST CENTURY. THE REST OF THE WORLD, MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT IS WORKING AS HARD AS THEY CAN TO OUTDO US. CHINA'S OWN A PATH TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ENROLLED IN COLLEGE BY 2030, WHICH MEANS THEY'LL HAVE NEARLY 200 MILLION COLLEGE GRADUATES. MORE THAN OUR ENTIRE WORKFORCE. I BELIEVE AMERICAN WORKERS CAN OUT-WORK AND OUT-INNOVATE ANYONE IN THE WORLD. IS GIVEN THE TRAINING AND EDUCATION THEY DESERVE.   THAT IS WHY I AM PROPOSING IT IS TIME FOR NEW COLLEGE COMPACT WERE EVERYONE DOES THEIR PART. WE NEED TO MAKE A QUALITY EDUCATION AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE WILLING TO WORK FOR IT WITHOUT SADDLING THEM WITH THE DECADES OF DEBT. AS I'VE BEEN TALKING WITH PEOPLE, I HAVE REACHED OUT TO STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AND EDUCATORS AND LEGISLATORS AND EXPERTS INCLUDING YOUNG PROGRESSIVE ACTIVISTS WHO POINT TO THE ISSUE OF DEBT-FREE COLLEGE AND AFFORDABILITY AT THE TOP OF THE AGENDA. TODAY, I'M ANNOUNCING MY PLAN TO PUT COLLEGE WITHIN REACH FOR EVERYONE. WE'RE CALLING IT THE NEW COLLEGE COMPACT. WE ARE POSTING IT ON OUR WEBSITE, FACEBOOK, SNAP CHAT, JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE WE CAN THINK OF. OR YOU CAN TEXT THE WORD ""COLLEGE"" TO THE NUMBER TO LEARN MORE AND I HOPE YOU WILL CHECK IT OUT. FOR NOW, HERE ARE THE BASICS. UNDER THE NEW COLLEGE COMPACT, NO STUDENT SHOULD HAVE TO BORROW TO PAY TUITION AT A PUBLIC COLLEGE.   SCHOOLS WILL HAVE TO CONTROL THEIR COSTS AND SHOW MORE ACCOUNTABILITY TO THEIR STUDENTS. NO MORE 42% INCREASES OVER 10 YEARS, WAY ABOVE THE RATES OF INFLATION OF ANYTHING ELSE. STATES WILL HAVE TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATION TO INVEST IN HIGHER EDUCATION.   THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL INCREASE ITS INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION, AND WILL NOT PROFIT OFF STUDENT LOANS.  HILLARY CLINTON AND EVERYONE WHO ALREADY HAS STUDENT DEBT WILL BE ABLE TO REFINANCE IT AT LOWER RATES.   NOW, THIS IS MY PLAN. I KNOW IT IS A VICIOUS BUT I THINK WE SHOULD BE AMBITIOUS BECAUSE IT IS ACHIEVABLE AND WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. THE NEW COLLEGE COMPACT COMES DOWN TO TWO BIG GOALS. FIRST, WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT COST WON'T BE A BARRIER. UNDER MY PLAN, TUITION WILL BE AFFORDABLE FOR EVERY FAMILY. STUDENT SHOULD NOT HAVE TO TAKE OUT LOAN OR TUITION AT THEIR STATE'S PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. WE'LL MAKE SURE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATES STEP UP TO HELP PAY THE COST, SO THE BURDEN DOESN'T FALL ON FAMILIES ALONE. BUT HERE IS AN IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL POINT I WANT TO UNDERSCORE ABOUT MY COMPACT. TUITION THESE DAYS IS NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM. THE COST OF LIVING AND ATTENDING COLLEGE HAS ALSO BEEN INCREASING. SO UNDER MY PLAN, STUDENTS WHO QUALIFY FOR PELL GRANTS WILL BE FREE TO ALL TO USE THEM FOR LIVING EXPENSES AND MIDDLE-CLASS STUDENTS WILL HAVE AN EASIER TIME PAYING FOR LIVING EXPENSES AS WELL.   WE'RE ALSO GOING TO MAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE. THAT'S PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN WE ARE ADOPTING GET.   IF STUDENTS START AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND TRANSFER TO A FOUR-YEAR SCHOOL, WE WILL MAKE SURE YOUR CREDITS COUNT YOUR TRANSITION IS SEAMLESS.   AND WE WANT MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO OFFER TWO-YEAR DEGREES AND CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS THAT ARE VALUED BY EMPLOYER SO STUDENTS KNOW THAT, IF THEY DO THE WORK, THEY'RE IN GOOD SHAPE TO GET A GOOD JOB. WE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND HISPANIC-SERVING INSTITUTIONS, BECAUSE OF A SURVEY LOT OF VERY BRIGHT AND NEEDY STUDENTS. -- THEY SERVE A LOT OF VERY BRIGHT AND NEEDY STUDENTS. WE WILL OFFER SPECIAL HELP TO COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ARE PARENTS, BECAUSE WHEN YOU HELP PARENTS GET AN EDUCATION, YOU'RE HELPING THEIR CHILDREN.   AND WE'LL MAKE A PROMISE TO STUDENTS WHO PERFORM NATIONAL SERVICE. IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SPEND YEARS TUTORING AMERICA'S KIDS OR CLEANING UP OUR PARKS OR HELPING COMMUNITIES HIT BY DISASTERS, WE'LL GUARANTEE THAT YOU CAN ATTEND YOUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE DEBT-FREE.   SO THAT'S THE FIRST BIG GOAL. HERE'S THE SECOND -- WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT DEBT WON'T HOLD ANYONE BACK. FOR THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS INCLUDING MANY OF YOU LIVE ALREADY HAS STUDENT DEBT MY PLAN , WILL GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO REFINANCE AT LOWER INTEREST RATES. IT JUST MAKES SENSE. IF YOU CAN REFINANCE YOUR MORTGAGE OR YOUR CAR LOAN, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO REFINANCE YOUR STUDENT LOAN.   IT'S JUST WRONG THAT PEOPLE ARE LOCKED INTO COLLEGE LOANS AT 8%, 9%, EVEN 10% INTEREST. IF YOU DO END UP TAKING OUT A LOAN FOR EXAMPLE TO GO TO A PRIVATE COLLEGE, WE WILL CUT YOUR INTEREST RATES, SO THE GOVERNMENT NEVER MAKES A PROFIT OFF YOUR LOAN. WE'LL MAKE IT EASIER TO ENROLL IN INCOME-BASED REPAYMENT PROGRAMS, SO YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN 10% OF WHAT YOU MAKE. AND YOUR DEBT -- YOUR DEBT WILL ONLY LAST FOR A FIXED PERIOD OF TIME. IT WON'T HANG OVER YOUR HEAD FOREVER. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO HELP BORROWERS WHO ARE IN DEFAULT GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. TO ME TO THEIR OBLIGATION. AND WE WILL MAKE SURE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE MORE SKIN IN THE GAME. IF THEY LOAD STUDENTS UP WITH DEBT FOR PROGRAMS THAT DON'T LEAD TO GOOD-PAYING JOBS, IT SHOULDN'T JUST BE THE STUDENTS AND TAXPAYERS SHOULD NOT BE THE ONLY LEFT HOLDING THE BAG. ONES COLLEGES DESERVE SOME OF THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THEY WILL HAVE TO FULFILL IT.  HILLARY CLINTON BANK AND WE'LL CRACK DOWN ON PREDATORY SCHOOLS, LENDERS, AND BILL COLLECTORS. IF YOU DEFRAUD STUDENTS, OVERCHARGE VETERANS, OR MISLEAD BORROWERS, WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING TO HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE AND STOP YOU.   I WANT TO STRENGTHEN THE G.I. BILL SO MORE VETERANS CAN GET THEIR DEGREE --   AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT COLLEGES SPEND FEDERAL DOLLARS ON THINGS THAT BENEFIT STUDENTS, LIKE TEACHING AND RESEARCH AND NOT MARKETING CAMPAIGNS OR BIG SALARIES FOR ADMINISTRATORS.   AND FINALLY I WANT TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATION. PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY REBOOTING THEIR CAREERS THROUGH ONLINE PROGRAMS, YET MANY STUDENTS CAN'T USE FEDERAL STUDENT AID TO PAY FOR THEM. IF EARNING ONLINE BADGES, SPECIALIZATIONS, OR NANO-DEGREES HELPS PEOPLE IMPROVE THEIR JOB PROSPECTS, WE SHOULD BE MAKING THAT OPTION EASIER AND MORE AFFORDABLE. AND UNDER MY PLAN, MORE STUDENTS WILL BE ALLOWED TO USE STUDENT AID TO PAY FOR HIGH-QUALITY PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY ONLINE. AND WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT RULES ABOUT ACCREDITATION DON'T KEEP OUT PROMISING ONLINE EDUCATION COMPANIES. WE WANT TO KEEP QUALITY HIGH WITHOUT STIFLING INNOVATION. NOW, THE REASON I CALL THIS A COLLEGE COMPACT IS BECAUSE IT GOES BOTH WAYS. EVERYONE'S GOING TO HAVE TO STEP UP. WE CAN'T FIX THE PROBLEM OF RISING COSTS AND RISING DEBT JUST BY THROWING MORE MONEY AT THE PROBLEM. WE CAN'T EXPECT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST TO PAY THE BILL FOR FREE. THAT'S NOT HOW AMERICA WORKS. STATES WILL HAVE TO START INVESTING IN EDUCATION AGAIN. COLLEGES WILL HAVE TO DO BETTER BY THEIR STUDENTS. AS STUDENTS WANT TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION OF WORKING 10 HOURS A WEEK, AMERICANS WILL HAVE TO WORK HARD TO PUT THEMSELVES THROUGH SCHOOL TO OUT LEARN AND OUTHUSTLED OUR COMPONENT -- COMPETITORS JUST LIKE WILL ALWAYS HAVE. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THIS IS JUST COMMON SENSE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR PEOPLE IN THIS CAMPAIGN TALK ABOUT IMPROVING THE ECONOMY, HELPING INCOMES RISE, ASK OF THE WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AND BEGIN TO DEAL WITH THE DEBT BURDEN THAT IS HOLDING TOO MANY AMERICANS BACK.   I WANT EVERY YOUNG PERSON IN AMERICA TO KNOW IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU CAN GET AHEAD AND I WANT AMERICA TO HAVE YOUR BACK JUST LIKE IT DID IN THE PAST AND LIKE SO MANY OF US BELIEVE. I HAD A LOAN TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL. IT WAS A GOVERNMENT LOAN. IT WAS AT A VERY LOW INTEREST RATE AND I PAID IT BACK AS A PERCENTAGE OF MY INCOME OVER TIME. SO DID MY HUSBAND. WE WORKED HARD AND ALL OF THE TIME, EXTRA JOBS, EXTRA OPPORTUNITIES TO EARN MONEY IN ORDER TO PAY OUR WAY. THAT HELP FROM OUR GOVERNMENT MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. I AM ASKING PEOPLE, YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR PART. YOU HAVE TO WORK HARD TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO MAKE YOUR CONTRIBUTION BUT WE SHOULD HAVE YOUR BACK. I WANT EVERY PARENT TO KNOW THAT KIDS -- HE IS OR HER CHILD CAN GET A DEGREE OR YOU CAN GET ONE YOURSELF. THAT IS THE COUNTRY I WANT TO HELP BUILD FOR THIS GENERATION AND ALL GENERATIONS TO COME. I LOVE FORWARD TO TALKING WITH YOU ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.   THANK YOU. WELL -- THE ANSWER IS YES AND YES. THE FIRST YES IS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY. WE HAVE GOT TO DO MORE HERE TO GET MORE CHILDREN PREPARED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL. AND I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS. SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT IT BEFORE. BECAUSE WE CAN DO, EVERYTHING I OUTLINED AND GET MORE KIDS INTO AFFORDABLE COLLEGE AND GET AT THE DEBT LOAD DOWN AND WE COULD DO A LOT TO WORK WITH GREAT SCHOOLS LIKE THIS AND OTHERS TO HELP MORE SCHOOL -- STUDENTS SUCCEED. ZERO TO FIVE YEARS SET THE PATTERN INTO MANY KIDS COME TO SCHOOL BEHIND ALREADY. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I AM SAYING JUST BECAUSE I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT IT AND I AM A NEW GRANDMOTHER AND READING THE TALKING AND SINGING TO CHARLOTTE. BRAIN RESEARCH SHOWS THAT. 80% OF YOUR BRAIN IS PHYSICALLY FORMED BY THE AGE OF THREE. AND KIDS STIMULATED, HAVE GOOD EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS, WHOSE FAMILIES HAVE THE TIME AND ENERGY AND UNDERSTANDING TO HELP PREPARE THEIR OWN KIDS, THEY WILL DO WELL. WE ALSO KNOW FROM THE RESEARCH THAT BY THE TIME KIDS GET TO KINDERGARTEN, KIDS LIKE MY GRANDDAUGHTER WILL OF HER 30 MILLION MORE WORDS THAN CHILDREN FROM LESS ADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS. THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WILL LITERALLY START ON THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE TEACHERS AND I HOPE WE HAVE A LOT OF TEACHERS HERE --   YOU UNDERSTAND THIS. YOU WILL DO YOUR VERY BEST AND THE CLASSROOM AND THE SCHOOL AND TRY TO HELP EVERY KID FULFILL HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN ADVANTAGE BUT IT WOULD BE A LOT MORE SUCCESSFUL IF WE HAD UNIVERSAL PRE-K A GOOD EARLY CHILDHOOD IN OUR COUNTRY. THE SECOND YES IS BOLD AS A FIRST LADY AND A SENATOR AS SECRETARY OF DATE, I WORKED ON THE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR COUNTRY WHICH IS SUCH A GENEROUS COUNTRY DID WHAT WE COULD TO HELP THE SMALLEST, MOST VULNERA BLE OF CHILDREN AND WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS. WE HAVE MORE KIDS INTO SCHOOLS AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND CUT THE INFANT MORTALITY RATE AND WITH MADE PROGRESS. WE STILL HAVE TO MANY PLACES IN OUR WORLD WHERE KIDS DIE TOO YOUNG. WHERE THEY ARE STUNTED FROM POOR NUTRITION. AS THEY ARE NOT GIVEN ADEQUATE EDUCATION. I HAVE MADE THIS POINT. I WRITE ABOUT IN MY BOOK, I HAVE MADE IT IN MANY SPEECHES AROUND THE WORLD. I BELIEVE WHAT THE UNITED STATES DOES THROUGH OUR GOVERNMENT AND THROUGH OUR PHILANDERER THE AT FAITH COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUAL CHARITIES IS JUST ASTONISHING. YOU KNOW, WE ARE A GENEROUS, CARING NATION. AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IT REALLY HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE THE WORK THAT AMERICANS HAVE DONE AROUND THE WORLD. AND I STARTED A PROGRAM WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN SEE TO THE FUTURE AND A REPRESENTS MY VIEWS AND BECAME ONE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S BIGGEST INITIATIVES -- FEED THE FUTURE. IT IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT TO HELP PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO FEED THEMSELVES AND CREATE A MARKET ECONOMY AROUND THOSE CROPS THAN TO ALWAYS HAVE TO BE PROVIDING EMERGENCY FOOD AID. WHAT WE DID WITH FEED THE FUTURE WAS TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO GO AFTER MALNUTRITION. WE STILL HAVE EMERGENCY HELP FOR MALNOURISHED CHILDREN. WE ARE DOING MORE TO HELP PEOPLE HAVE THE TOOLS TO HELP THEMSELVES AND THEIR KIDS. A PROBLEM YOU DID NOT MENTION THE BUT ONE I WILL THROW IN IS CLEAN WATER. WE HAVE ONE BILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WITHOUT ACCESS TO CLEAN, SAFE DRINKING WATER. THESE ARE NOT ONLY IMPORTANT CHARITABLE OPPORTUNITIES. ALSO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE WE HAVE A GREAT COMPANIES IN AMERICA ARE REALLY GOOD AT KNOWING HOW TO DO THIS. IF WE CAN CONTINUE TO LINK OF OUR PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS IN DEALING WITH THESE PROBLEMS, I THINK WE WILL GO FAR IN MEETING YOUR GOALS. THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT.  HILLARY CLINTON RAN RIGHT THERE. HERE WE GO.  THANK YOU FOR TEACHING AND CARING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR STUDENTS YEAR ROUND, NOT JUST WHEN YOU HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM. ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO STRESS ABOUT IMPROVING EDUCATION IN OUR COUNTRY IS WE SHALL LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE ABOUT WHAT WORKS. A LOT OF OF PEOPLE HAVE A BIG ARGUMENTS OVER THE RIGHT THINGS TO DO BUT THEY OFTEN DO NOT REFERENCE THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE WE HAVE ABOUT WHAT WORKS. YOU PUT YOUR FINGER ON WHAT SEEMED THAT WORKS. KIDS WHO DO NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AS MANY OF US TRY TO PROVIDE FOR OWN CHILDREN OVER THE SUMMER ACTUALLY LOSE GROUND. YOU CAN WORK REALLY HARD ALL YEAR AS A STUDENT, AS A FAMILY TO SUPPORT THE STUDENT, AND AS THE TEACHER. THEN YOU HAVE THREE MONTHS AND OTHER KIDS LIKE YOUR NIECES AND NEPHEWS ARE GOING TO MUSEUMS AND GOING ON INTERESTING TRIPS. MAYBE WATCHING MOVIES WITH OUR FAMILY THAT THEY TALK ABOUT. A LOT OF STIMULATION. WE KNOW A LONGER SCHOOL YEAR, SUMMER PROGRAMS, A LONGER SCHOOL DAY, ARE ESPECIALLY HELPFUL IN CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP BETWEEN KIDS WHO DO NOT HAVE ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT AND KIDS WHO DO. HONESTLY, A GOOD SUMMER PROGRAM CAN MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THE DISTRICT SHALL LOOK AT PARTICULARLY FOR KIDS WHO MAY NOT HAVE GOOD ALTERNATIVES. THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT. THAT IS GREAT. IS A YOUNG WOMAN BACK OF THEIR. YES, YOU. -- THE YOUNG WOMAN BACK THERE. >> I JUST GOT BACK FROM DOING A YEAR OF SERVICE FROM TEHHE CORPS IN LOS ANGELES. ONE THING I'VE NOTICED THAT REALLY BOTHERED ME WAS THAT THERE WAS NO SCHOOL NURSE AND VERY FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STUDENTS. AND THE OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED WERE PROVIDED BY PHILANTHROPIST AND NOT THE GOVERNMENT OR OTHER FEDERAL AGENCY. I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO DO IN REGARDS TO GAIN REDUCTION -- GANG REDUCTION.  THANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF AMERICORPS AND DOING YOUR SERVICE. WE HAVE 75,000, MOSTLY YOUNG PEOPLE IN AMERICORPS EVERY YEAR. I WANT TO GET IT UP TO 250,000. I REALLY BELIEVE IN SERVICE. I BELIEVE IN SERVICE IN EITHER NATIONAL SERVICE, MILITARY SERVICE, SOME SERVICE A YOUNG PERSON CAN DO TO GET BACK TO OUR COUNTRY AND THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. AGAIN, WE ARE NOT ALWAYS BEING SMART ABOUT HOW TO MAKE A BETTER INVESTMENT THAT WILL SAVE US MONEY. KIDS WHO ARE IN SCHOOL WHO HAVE SOME SORT OF MEDICAL OR HEALTH ISSUE. IF IT IS NOT TAKING CARE OF, IT CAN INTERFERE WITH THEIR LEARNING. I'VE SEEN IT OVER MANY YEARS WITH THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND . KIDS WHO DO NOT KNOW THEY CANNOT HEAR DO NOT KNOW THEY ARE NOT SEEING WELL HAVE ABSENTEES THAT -- JUST PROBLEMS. MOST OF US HAVE NOT THANKFULLY HAD TO EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE A LOT OF KIDS WHO SHOW UP IN SCHOOL WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE STEADILY CUT BACK ON A NURSE OR SOME KIND OF HEALTH CARE PROGRAM. YOU ARE SO RIGHT. I AM SO GRATEFUL TO PHILANDERER PIECE THAT DOES PHILANTHROPIST -- PHILANTHROPISTS THAT PAY TO SEND NURSES TO 10 SCHOOLS BUT WE HAVE 10,000 SCHOOLS. HOW DO WE PAY FOR SERVICES TO MAKE SURE KIDS ARE HEALTHY AND DO AS WELL AS THEY CAN? THE ONLY WAY IS TO HAVE A MUCH MORE SUPPORTIVE PROGRAM FROM THE GOVERNMENT FROM THE LOCAL STATE- FEDERAL LEVEL. I KNOW IT SAVES MONEY IN THE LONG RUN. PEOPLE SAY WELL TO PUT OUR NURSE IN EVERY SCHOOL. YOU GOVERNORS COVERING TWO OR THREE SCHOOLS. YOU CAN DO THAT. THE POINT IS WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE? SICK KIDS WHO DO NOT DO WELL AND WILL OFTEN DROP OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT DOING ALL AND WILL NEVER LIVE UP TO THEIR POTENTIAL IN MY BOOK, BURDEN. A FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THE REST OF US. -- AND BECOME A BURDEN. WE HAVE TO GET SMART ON HOW WE SPEND OUR MONEY TO GET THE BEST RESULTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND RAISING THAT ISSUE. I HEAR ABOUT IT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF HEALTH CARE CONTINUITY. NOW THAT WE HAVE THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT AND MORE CHILDREN ARE AVAILABLE FOR TREATMENT --   WE AT LEAST HAVE A FUNDING STREAM TO TAKE CARE OF PROBLEMS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED. OFTEN TIMES THE ISSUE IS HOW TO GET THEM IDENTIFIED? WHO WILL BE ON THE FRONTLINE? A CHILD SPENT NEVER EIGHT HOURS AND THAT IS A GREAT WAY TO REFER THEM AND TREAT THE WAS THAT CAN BE TREATED AND THE SCHOOL SITE. THANK YOU FOR THAT. OH, MY GOODNESS FOR YOU WE GO. HOW ABOUT YOU?  THANK YOU FOR DOING  THANK YOU FOR   DOING THAT WORK.  YOU KNOW, FOR DEALING WITH A   GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE  PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE, THE EXPLOITED, THE MARGINIZED, THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT SOME GROUPS OF KIDS NEED MORE INTENSIVE HELP. THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT.  I REALLY THINK THAT WE HAVE GOT TO DO MORE TO DEAL WITH THESE VULNERABLE GROUPS OF KIDS AND I  WOULD JUST MAYBE LIST A COUPLE OF THEM. KIDS IN JUVENILE FACILITIES. A LOT OF KIDS, THEY MAKE A MISTAKE AND THEN THEY ARE PUT  INTO A FACILITY WHERE OFTEN  THEY GET WORSE, NOT BETTER. THEY DON'T GET ADEQUATE EDUCATION. THEY OFTEN DON'T EVEN GET  ADEQUATE NUTRITION, EXERCISE, ANYTHING ELSE. THEN WE TURN THEM OUT AND WE   WAIT FOR THEM TO DO SOMETHING  WORSE BECAUSE WHAT DO YOU KNOW?  THEY HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN  GIVEN THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO   DO ANY BETTER AND THEY DON'T   SEE MUCH OF A FUTURE. THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM.  YOU KNOW, IN SO MANY PLACES, YOU'RE IN FOSTER CARE UNTIL YOU  GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL OR   TURN 18, WHICHEVER IS FIRST. I HAVE WORKED ON FOSTER CARE ISSUES FOR A REALLY LONG TIME  GOING BACK TO MY CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND DAYS. I HAVE DEFENDED FOSTER CARE KIDS AND ADVOCATED FOR LEGAL CHANGES AS FIRST LADY AND WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE TO GET CHANGES IN FOSTER CARE. IT REALLY BREAKS MY HEART. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE EVER KNOWN FOSTER KIDS. I'VE KNOWN MANYOR THEM.  SO MANY OF THEM JUST NEED SOME SUPPORT AND PERMANENCE AND PREDICTABILITY.  ALONG COMES THE AGE OF 18 AND  IN SOME CASES OF OUR COUNTRY, THE SOCIAL WORKER SHOWS UP WITH  EVERYTHING THEY OWN IN A BLACK   GARBAGE BAG AND SAYS YOU'RE ON   YOUR OWN.  IF THEY TURNED 18 AND THEY ARE   IN THE MIDDLE OF HIGH SCHOOL, IF THEY ARE LUCKY ENOUGH, THE FOSTER FAMILY SAYS STAY HERE   UNTIL YOU GRADUATE. SOMETIMES THEY ARE NOT. AND THEY ARE LITERALLY SENT OUT  THE DOOR.  I HAD TO HELP AND INTERVENE AS   A SENATOR AND WITH OTHER PEOPLE  TO HELP KIDS WHO ARE SLEEPING  IN THIS BUS STATIONS WHO WANT  TO FINISH SCHOOL AND NOWHERE TO GO.  I HAVE TALKED TO FOSTER KIDS   WHO I HAVE TALKED TO FOSTER KIDS WHO HAVE NOWHERE TO GO AND  THE DORM IS CLOSED.  WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO   THEM?  I MENTION THIS BECAUSE WE COULD NEVER FORGET BECAUSE AS  CHALLENGING AS IT IS FOR MANY  PEOPLE NOW, ECONOMICALLY AND IT IS, THERE ARE GROUP S OF   PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY  WHO ARE REALLY IN TROUBLE. SO I WANT TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO   DO MORE, TO HELP THEM AND I  WILL LOOK FOR WAYS TO DO THAT.  MY GOODNESS. OH!  OK. I WAS GOING TO GO THIS WAY AND   THEN COME BACK.  IS THAT OK?  I'LL BE BACK. I PROMISE. I PROMISE. I'LL BE BACK. OK. THE GENTLEMAN IN UNIFORM BACK  THERE.   YOU WILL HAVE   IT.  YOU WILL HAVE MY HELP. YOU WILL HAVE IT.   YOU KNOW --   THANK YOU FOR NOT ONLY EXPLAINING WHAT IS HAPPENING, BUT FOR BEING COMMITTED TOING US.  AND TO CLEAN UP THE V.A. SO  THAT IT OPERATES AS IT SHOULD FOR YOU AND FOR EVERY VETERAN  INCLUDING YOUR SON, WHEN HE EVENTUALLY IS NO LONGER ACTIVE DUTY. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE A PATRIOT. THAT'S WHY I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.  I WILL BE YOUR PARTNER IN THIS BECAUSE I BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT  --    THERE IS NO EXCUSE.  ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE. NO EXCUSE FOR CORRUPTION. NO EXCUSE FOR NEGLIGENCE.  NO EXCUSE FOR ANY KIND OF  MISTAKE OR OVERSIGHT THAT IN   ANY WAY HARMS ONE OF OUR VETERANS.  SO WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. [NO  LET ME HAVE SOMEONE TALK WITH YOU AFTER THIS.  TO GET MORE INFORMATION. I CAN'T COMMENT -- THE LAWS MAY  NEED TO BE CHANGED. I CAN'T COMMENT ON LEGAL   MATTERS WITHOUT KNOWING. YOU GIVE US INFORMATION. YOU GOT IT.  YOU ARE WELL PREPARED. I CAN TELL . YOU ARE AN EXCELLENT MEMBER OF   THE UNITED STATES NAVY. THANK YOU. WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU.   WE WILL FOLLOW UP AND I WILL   MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE GOOD  INFORMATION WITH -- FROM YOU   AND TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.  YOU KNOW -- I JUST KNEW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING I SAW IN YOU WHEN YOU  STOOD UP. WE'LL GET IT DONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY GOODNESS. WOW. THAT WAS GREAT.  THANK YOU. YES, MA'AM, RIGHT HERE.  YES, THIS IS A  PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE GOT AROUND  THE COUNTRY. SOME STATES ARE BEGINNING TO   DEAL WITH IT. THEY ARE BEGINNING TO OFFER INSTATE TUITION TO UNDOCUMENTED  HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES WHO WANT   TO GO ON TO COLLEGE. SOME STATES ARE ALSO WORKING TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL AID. I WANT TO ENCOURAGE MORE OF  THAT.  I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT. BECAUSE I WANT COMPREHENSIVE   IMMIGRATION REFORM WHICH WILL GIVE US A VERY --   I WANT TO MAKE A SLIGHTLY  DIFFERENT ARGUMENT. IT GOES BACK TO MY POINT ABOUT CHINA. ONE OF OUR ADVANTAGES, AND   PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS RECK FIES THIS, IS THAT IMMIGRANTS START   MORE BUSINESSES. BY A VERY BIG PROPORTION.  I WANT MORE AMERICANS TO START   MORE BUSINESSES BUT IMMIGRANTS START MORE BUSINESSES NOW. WE HAVE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE IMMIGRANTS, BOTH LEGAL AND UNDOCUMENTED.  THAT IS ONE OF OUR ECONOMIC  ADVANTAGES. IT IS ALSO AN ADVANTAGE FOR  OLDER PEOPLE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO KEEP REPLENISHING OUR REVENUES   FOR SOCIAL SECURITY AND  MEDICARE SO THE MORE PEOPLE WE GET LEGALLY INTO THE WORKPLACE, THE BETTER IT WILL BE FOR OUR  ECONOMY, FOR OUR PROGRAMS LIKE   MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY AND IT WILL GIVE US AN ADVANTAGE IN COMPETING AGAINST   COUNTRIES THAT ARE ACTUALLY NOW STARTING TO AGE FASTER. I THINK WE HAVE GOT SOME REAL OPPORTUNITIES HERE.  SO THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT.  YES, THIS YOUNG WOMAN RIGHT  THERE. YES. HERE IT COMES.  WELL, I WILL BE FIGHTING WITH YOU RIGHT BY  YOUR SIDE TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO TRY TO PREVENT THESE TERRIBLE KILLINGS AND YOU JUST MENTIONED A FEW OF THEM, AS YOU SAY 88   PEOPLE KILLED BY GUNS EVERY DAY  IN AMERICA. NOW FROM EVERYTHING I HAVE EVER  SEEN, A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS  AND A MAJORITY OF GUN OWNERS SUPPORT UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND   CHECKS. AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS TO  OVERCOME A VERY ENTRENCHED   SPECIAL INTEREST THAT DOES NOT   REPRESENT, AS I SAY THE  MAJORITY OF AMERICANS OR THE   MAJORITY OF GUN OWNERS TO GET,   NUMBER ONE, A BACKGROUND CHECK THAT ACTUALLY WORKED AND WE  HAVE TOO MANY GLITCHES IN IT   RIGHT NOW THAT'S HOW THE YOUNG   MAN WHO MASSACRED THE NINE   PEOPLE IN CHARLESTON AT THEIR BIBLE STUDY, HE SHOULD NEVER   HAVE GOTTEN A GUN. THEY DIDN'T GET ALL THE  INFORMATION IN AND THERE IS A  THREE-DAY LIMIT AND HE GOT THE   AND WE KNOW HOW HE USED IT. I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT   THIS.  YOU KNOW. I JUST DON'T THINK THERE IS THE  KIND OF CONTRADICTION THAT SOME ON THE OTHER SIDE TRY TO ARGUE ON BEHALF OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT WITH SENSIBLE GUN  VIOLENCE PREVENTION MEASURES   AND PROTECTING PEOPLE'S RIGHTS   TO BEAR ARMS.  I WILL TAKE THAT ON. I KNOW THAT IT IS POLITICALLY CHALLENGING.  BUT AT SOME POINT, THIS -- YOU   KNOW, WE HAVE TO REGAIN OUR  SENSES. OUR COUNTRY LASTED FOR A REALLY  LONG TIME AND IN FACT, IT WAS ONLY RELATIVELY RECENTLY THAT  YOU KNOW, THE SUPREME COURT DECISION BEGAN TO REINTERPRET THE SECOND AMENDMENT.  WHAT ABOUT THE REST? WHAT ABOUT THE YOUNG MOM WITH  HER TWO KIDS WHO WAS IN A SUPERMARKET AND SOME GUY GETS  TO COME IN WITH AN AK-47 OVER  HIS BACK BECAUSE HE GOT A NEW PERMIT THAT PERMITS HIM TO WALK  AROUND AND THREATEN AND INTIMIDATE AND SCARE THE HECK OUT OF THAT YOUNG MOTHER AND HER CHILDREN! I DON'T GET IT!    SO WE HAVE WORK TO DO. WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO   DO. IT IS GOOD WORK. IT IS IMPORTANT WORK. OH, MY GOODNESS. THERE ARE JUST SO MANY HANDS.  OK.  YES, SIR.  WELL, CAN I   SAY THAT I HOPE WITH MY COMPACT, THE IDEA BEHIND THE   COMPACT IS THAT WE WILL PROVIDE  INCENTIVES FOR STATES TO DO  MORE TO BE ABLE TO CUT THE COST  SO THAT YOUNG PEOPLE CAN AFFORD  A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY,  AND AMONG THE LISTSOR THINGS I   WOULD LIKE TO SEE DONE IS  DE-EMPHASIZING LAYERS UPON   LAYERS OF ADMINISTRATION AND REEMPHASIZING TEACHING.  AND PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE -- I -- I HAVE BEEN MEETING A   NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE. T.H.D. IN AREAS OF SCARCITY, WHO'LL NOT -- THEY ARE NOT BEING HIRED. THEY ARE NOT BEING PUT ON A  TENURE TRACK BECAUSE THE   UNIVERSITY SAYS WELL, WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPACE FOR YOU. AND THEY ARE MAKING $22,000,   $24,000 A YEAR. BARELY ENOUGH. WELL, THEY CERTAINLY CAN'T PAY   OFF THEIR DEBTS AND THEY ARE   HAVING A VERY HARD TIME SUPPORTING THEIR FAMILIES. SO I JUST THINK SOMEHOW OUR  VALUES AND PRIORITIES GOT OUT  OF WHACK. YOU KNOW, I CAN'T SPEAK TO ANY PARTICULAR COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY, BUT I HAVE HEARD ENOUGH STORIES TO BELIEVE THAT   WE COULD DO A BETTER JOB STREAMLINING THE TOP, SAVING MONEY AND PUTTING MONEY INTO FACULTY, PARTICULARLY YOUNG FACULTY BECAUSE IT IS THE YOUNG FACULTY THAT ARE BEING MOST DISADVANTAGED BY EITHER NOT  BEING HIRED OR NOT BEING PAID  ADEQUATELY SO THAT THEY CAN'T  REALLY DO THE JOB THAT THEY  HAVE DREELED OF DOING. I'M WITH YOU ON THAT.  WE HAVE TO SEE HOW WE CAN MAKE THAT WORK.   OK. ANY MAN WITH THREE STICKERS  INCLUDING ONE ON HIS FOREHEAD!  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE A STAKE IN TRYING TO  IMPROVE EDUCATION AROUND THE WORLD TO TRY TO CREATE CONDITIONS FOR PEOPLE, PEOPLE'S ECONOMIC FORTUNES TO IMPROVE.  TO CREATE MIDDLE CLASSES AROUND  THE WORLD, WHICH IS TIED TO EDUCATION. THAT IS GOOD FOR US. THAT IS GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY.  THAT IS GOOD FOR OUR DEMOCRACY.  SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO WHAT WE CAN AND IT WILL HAVE TO BE A PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE IT IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN  GOVERNMENTS, THE PRIVATE   SECTOR, ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS, CHARITIES, FAITH-BASED GROUPS  AND A LOT OF OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT PARTNERS. I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY THAT YOUR QUESTION KIND OF   PROMPTED IN ME.  YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN -- WHEN I  WAS SECRETARY OF STATE, I WENT TO 112 COUNTRIES FOR YOU. AND THERE WERE A LOT OF PLACES THAT --    YOU KNOW, THAT WERE STILL DEVELOPING, THAT  WERE VERY POOR. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I WORKED HARD TO CREATE AN OPENING TO BURMA NOW CALLED MYANMAR IS  BECAUSE IT IS VERY STRATEGICICALLY LOCATED BUT ALSO HAD BEEN SO ISOLATED FOR SO LONG. IT WAS APPARENT UNDER MILITARY DICTATORSHIP, THE VERY TOP HAD   DONE VERY WELL.  THERE WAS NO MIDDLE CLASS. AND THEN THERE WAS JUST  DIFFERENT DEGREES OF POVERTY. AND WHEN YOU SEE THAT, AND YOU REALIZE HOW VULNERABLE PEOPLE ARE TO DISEASE AND TO OTHER,   YOU KNOW, BOTH HEALTH AND  EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS, YOU KNOW,  IT REALLY DOES GIVE YOU A GREAT PERSPECTIVE ON HOW BLESSED AND   FORTUNATE WE ARE AND WE HAVE TO  KEEP INVESTING IN THE OUR OWN  PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TO KEEP DOING BETTER BECAUSE WE HAVE SO  MUCH TO BE GRATEFUL FOR AND WE   HAVE TO OFFER IT TO OUR NEXT   GENERATION. AND I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD FROM THAT  PERSPECTIVE, I DIDN'T GO   ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD THAT   PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT  WAS HAPPENING IN AMERICA.  AND EVEN THOSE WHO WOULD   PUBLICLY CRITICIZE US WERE REALLY INTERESTED IN HOW WE  WERE SOLVING PROBLEMS AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA  BECAME PRESIDENT AND HE ASKED  ME TO BECOME SECRETARY OF STATE  IN THE MIDST OF THE TERRIBLE ECONOMIC CRISIS, THERE WAS A LOVET ANXIETY ABOUT THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY BECAUSE IT STILL  IS THE BASIC DRIVER OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WORLD. AND I COULD JUST SEE PEOPLE  SAYING IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR  THE UNITED STATES TO GET IT  RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO KEEP HOLDING UP THE BANNER OF FREEDOM AND  OPPORTUNITY AND EQUALITY FOR   EVERYBODY BECAUSE WITHOUT YOU, WE'RE REALLY GOING TO BE LOST. I THINK THAT IS TRUE.  I JUST HAVE TO TELL YOU. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO SAY  UpTHOSE   FOR AMERICAN LEADERSHIP ARE  BEHIND US, I THINK THEY ARE WRONG. IT IS NOT SOMEBODY ELSE'S LEADERSHIP.  IT IS NOBODY'S LEADERSHIP. THAT WOULD BE A VERY DANGEROUS   DEVELOPMENT IN THE WORLD WHERE   YOU DON'T HAVE THE VALUES, THE   INTEREST, THE ABILITY TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE BASICALLY LED FOR THE LAST CENTURY AND   NEED TO DO AGAIN. SO YOUR QUESTION, WHAT CAN WE  DO ABOUT KIDS LIVING FAR AWAY IS CONNECTED TO HOW WELL WE TAKE CARE OF OUR KIDS RIGHT HERE TODAY, BECAUSE WE CAN ONLY  BE AS STRONG AS OUR ECONOMY IS, OUR PEOPLE'S DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS ARE AND THAT'S WHY   IN THIS CAMPAIGN, WHAT I'M TRYING TO ARGUE FOR IS TO BUILD ON WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT AND  MAKE IT EVEN GREATER SO THAT OUR BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US,   NOT BEHIND US. BUT THAT CAUSES US TO HAVE TO  ASK OURSELVES HARD QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO   AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.  I THINK WE'RE UP TO IT.  I WOULD BPT RUNNING FOR  PRESIDENT IF I DIDN'T THINK WE   WERE UP TO IT.   THANKS FOR THE  HAIR COMPLIMENT BEFORE.  I DIDN'T STOP AND THANK YOU. I DIDN'T THINK YOU FOR THE HAIR COMPLIMENT.  YOU KNOW, SINCE WHO KNOWS WHAT   MY HAIR WILL LOOK LIKE FROM  DAY-TO-DAY.  ANY DAY THAT IT IS GOOD, I   APPRECIATE YOU NOTICING IT,  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU FOR   THE UPDATE.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  OH, BLESS YOU!  BLESS YOU!   I'M THRILLED TO HEAR HOW SHE IS DOING AND PLEASE GIVE HER A BIG HUG. GIVE HER ANOTHER BIG HUG FROM  ME, PLEASE.  THE LAST MONTH, MANY MONTHS  NOW, WE JUST HAD THE   ANNIVERSARY AT FERGUSON AND  ANOTHER INCIDENT OCCURRED, SOMEONE ELSE BEING SHOT. WE DON'T KNOW THE  CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT THE FACTS ARE ACROSS THE BOARD CONCERNING WE HAVE DEEP UNADDRESSED   SYSTEMIC RACE AND JUSTICE  ISSUES AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT  --     THAT WE   HONESTLY TALK ABOUT THEM AND TRY TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AROUND DEALING WITH THIS.  IT IS NOT ENOUGH JUST TO, YOU KNOW, SAY WE'RE CONCERNED. WE HAVE TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP AND SAY WE'RE SO CONCERNED. HERE IS WHAT WE ARE WILLING TO   DO. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THERE ARE   A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT I   HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FROM   THE VERY BEGINNINGOR MY CAMPAIGN.  ONE IS WE HAVE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT MASS INCARCERATION BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN --     IT HAS UNFORTUNATELY BEEN ONE OF THE  ROOT REASONS WHY SO MANY FAMILIES, PARTICULARLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE TORN APART, UNDERMINED, NEVER  FORMED AND THERE IS NO DOUBT -- THERE IS JUST NO DOUBT. NOBODY WANTS TO RETURN TO LACK   OF SAFETY OR RISING CRIME. SO LET'S JUST POCKET THAT. NOBODY WANTS THAT. BUT THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR THAT   IF YOU'RE AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN  MAN OF WHATEVER AGE, TEENAGER  AND UP, YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO   BE ARRESTED, TO BE CONVICTED,  TO BE IMPRISONED FOR DOING   EXACTLY THE SAME THING AS A  WHITE MAN WHO'LL NOT BE.   AND THAT IS NOT -- YOU KNOW THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT ANYBODY WROTE   DOWN IN A LAW. THAT IS JUST SOMETHING THAT HAS GROWN UP OVER TIME WHERE PEOPLE  MAKE THOSE DECISIONS.  AND WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB   WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT,  WORKING WITH THE ENTIRE  CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO THAT THE SYSTEM AND INDIVIDUAL  POLICE OFFICERS RESPECT THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE RESPECT THEM. AND THERE IS A LOT OF WORK   WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO. SOME OF THE WHAT I PROPOSED, BODY CAMERAS, THAT IS A WAY OF   AT LEAST HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE, BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE TRAINING, MORE   AWARENESS OF PEOPLE'S OWN  INDIVIDUAL FEELINGS OR MAYBE BIASES.  WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. I THINK THAT THESE TERRIBLE  INCIDENTSES OF A THE PAST YEAR, THEY GO WAY BACK, BUT CERTAINLY  IN THE HEADLINES OF THE PAST   YEAR REALLY CALL ON EVERYBODY  IN EVERY COMMUNITY JUST TO SAY HEY, WE NEED TO DO A VERY CLEAR ASSESSMENT ABOUT WHERE WE STAND. NOW LET'S RID OURSELVES OF BIAS AND PREDGES AND DISCRIMINATION AND MAKE SURE OUR POLICE OFFICERS ARE WELL PREPARED FOR THE DIFFICULT JOBS WE ASK THEM TO DO. LET'S TRY TO WORK WITH   COMMUNITIES SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT AND   OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY YOUNG MEN.  WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT WORK IF WE DON'T ADMIT WE HAVE A PROBLEM. AND I THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO  IT AND YES, OF COURSE BLACK  LIVES MATTER. THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.    THANK YOU.  I HAVE GOT TIME FOR ONE MORE   QUESTION. ANYBODY ON COLLEGE? I'LL TALK ABOUT ANYTHING BUT I   WANT TO MAKE SURE SINCE PEOPLE   CAME TO TALK ABOUT COLLEGE, I  WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET A COLLEGE QUESTION. OK.  WHY DON'T YOU ASK?  FIRST OF ALL,   I'M REALLY SORRY THAT THAT   HAPPENED TO YOU. THAT IS JUST WRONG.  I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS BUT I   WILL SAY WITHOUT FEAR OF CONTINUE DICTION, THAT IS WRONG. -- CONTRADICTION, THAT IS WRONG. WITH THE VARIABLE RATE INTEREST THAT THEY KICKED UP ON YOU.  WELL, YOU GOING TO BE HELPED BY  MY PLAN. I CAN TELL YOU THAT. BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE  TO --   TO REFINANCE ALL OF YOUR DEBT  TO BRING IT DOWN TO WHERE THE  INTEREST RATE IS RIGHT NOW.  WHO DID YOU BORROW FROM? WERE THOSE GOVERNMENT LOANS OR PRIVATE LOANS? SO YOU HAVE GOVERNMENT LOANS   PLUS THREE PRIVATE ONES. WELL, AUFL O THEM CAN BE REFINANCED.  WE HAVE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, WHEN WE DID THE NUMBERS ON   THIS, THE WAY WE WILL PAY FOR IT IS BY CLOSING THE LOOPHOLES AND THE DEDUCTIONS FOR PEOPLE  AT THE TOP AND WE WILL GO AND  IN ONE INSTANCE, WE WILL GO  BACK TO WHERE IT WAS WHEN  PRESIDENT REAGAN WAS IN OFFICE. YOU KNOW, I THINK THE REPUBLICANS SHOULD LOVE AND EMBRACE. AND WE WILL TAKE THE MONEY THAT WE SAVE FROM CLOSING THOSE AND   THEN WE WILL USE IT TO DO EXACTLY WHAT I SAID. TO REFINANCE LOANS. 40 MILLION PEOPLE. YOU'RE ONE OF THEM. WHO HAVE THOSE LOANS THAT DESPERATELY NEED REFINANCING. YOU'RE A GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MAN. YOU OUGHT TO BE OUT IN THE   WORLD MAKING YOUR WAY AND I  HOPE YOU CAN BE. I KNOW HOW CHALLENGING IT IS   FOR YOU TO HAVE THOSE KINDS OF   DEBTS AND BE BACK AT HOME AFTER  YOU HAVE FINISHED YOUR   EDUCATION. SO WE WANT TO",Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton Remarks on College Affordability

THANK YOU. HI. HI. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.  THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. I -- I WANT TO TELL YOU IT IS WONDERFUL BEING BACK HERE AT NYU AND I THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING ME TODAY, AND ESPECIALLY MY GOOD FRIEND AND FORMER COLLEAGUE CONGRESSWOMAN CAROLYN MALONEY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME OF MY FURTHER. ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND THE WORK THAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS TO DO IN THE YEARS AHEAD. FIRST, I WANT TO SAY A WORD ABOUT WHAT IS IN THE NEWS TODAY. AND IT IS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF INACCURACIES, AS CONGRESSMAN CUMMINGS MADE CLEAR THIS MORNING. MAYBE THE HEAT IS GETTING TO EVERYBODY. WE ALL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO GET THIS RIGHT. I HAVE RELEASED 55,000 PAGES OF E-MAILS. I HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY THAT I WILL ANSWER QUESTIONS BEFORE THE HOUSE COMMITTEE. WE ARE ALL ACCOUNTABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO GET THE FACTS RIGHT, AND I WILL DO MY PART. BUT I AM ALSO GOING TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE ISSUES, PARTICULARLY THE BIG ISSUES THAT REALLY MATTER TO AMERICAN FAMILIES. YOU KNOW, OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING YOUNG PEOPLE ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. MANY CAME OF AGE IN THE WAKE OF THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE DEEP RECESSION A CAUSE. THE FALLOUT FROM THAT CRASH HAS TEMPERED THEIR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE FUTURE AND LEFT THEM CLEAR EYED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES AHEAD. THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE AND THAT AMERICA FACES. YET LIKE GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS BEFORE THEM, THERE IS ALSO UNDIMMED OPTIMISM. TODAY'S YOUNG PEOPLE ARE PREPARING TO ENTER AN ECONOMY THEY KNOW WILL BE COMPETITIVE. NOT JUST AT HOME, BUT GLOBALLY. THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO FIND A GOOD JOB AFTER GRADUATION THAT CAN HELP THEM GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. THE RISK OF A SETBACK, OR POTENTIALLY ANOTHER CRISIS, IS NEVER FAR FROM THEIR MINDS. BUT WHAT INSPIRES ME IS THEY ARE UNDAUNTED BY THESE CHALLENGES. THEY ARE SEEKING REAL OPPORTUNITIES AND REAL REWARDS FOR THE WORK THEY PUT IN AND THEY ARE HOPEFUL THAT TOMORROW WILL INDEED BE BETTER THAN TODAY. SO, I HEAR THE STORIES EVERYWHERE I GO. THE HARD WORK AND GRIT AND SACRIFICE OF PEOPLE ACROSS OUR COUNTRY THAT HAVE BROUGHT US THAT AND DRIVEN OUR RECOVERY. SO, YES, NOW WE ARE STANDING AGAIN, BUT WE ARE NOT YET RUNNING THE WAY AMERICA SHOULD. NO COUNTRY IS BETTER POSITIONED TO THRIVE IN TODAY'S GLOBAL ECONOMY THAT WE ARE. WE HAVE THE MOST INNOVATIVE, ENTERPRISING PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE MOST TALENTED WORKERS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. CORPORATE PROFITS ARE AT NEAR RECORD HIGHS, BUT PAYCHECKS FOR NORMAL PEOPLE HAVE BARELY BUDGED. AND OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR EVERYTHING, FROM HEALTH CARE TO CHILDCARE TO COLLEGE TO CARING FOR AGING PARENTS, ARE RISING A LOT FASTER THAN WAGES. THAT IS PUTTING A LOT OF PRESSURE, AND NORMAN US PRESSURE ON FAMILIES AND THEIR BUDGETS. MY MISSION, FROM MY FIRST DAY AS PRESIDENT TO THE LAST WILL BE TO RAISE THE INCOMES OF HARD-WORKING AMERICANS SO THEY CAN ONCE AGAIN AFFORD A MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. WE NEED TO --   WE NEED TO END THE WAGE STAGNATION THAT IS HOLDING BACK OUR FAMILIES AND HOLDING BACK OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS THE DEFINING ECONOMIC CHALLENGE NOT ONLY OF THIS ELECTION, BUT OUR TIME. IT GETS TO THE CORE OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. THE BASIC BARGAIN OF AMERICA. IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. AND WHEN YOU GET AHEAD, OUR COUNTRY GETS AHEAD, TOO. I LAID OUT A BROAD ECONOMIC AGENDA TO RAISE INCOMES AND BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE ALREADY AT THE TOP. IT IS AN AGENDA FOR FAIR GROWTH AND LONG-TERM GROWTH AND I WILL CONTINUE OUTLINING PLANS AND ALL OF THESE AREAS, FROM SETTING AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENTS, TO REINING IN EXCESSIVE RISK ON WALL STREET. TODAY, I WANT TO FOCUS IN PARTICULAR ON LONG-TERM GROWTH. CONSIDER THIS FACT. A SURVEY OF CORPORATE EXECUTIVES FOUND THAT MORE THAN HALF WOULD HOLD OFF MAKING A SUCCESSFUL LONG-TERM INVESTMENT IF IT MEANT MISSING A TARGET IN THE NEXT QUARTERLY EARNINGS REPORT. IN ANOTHER RECENT SURVEY, MORE THAN 60% SAID THE PRESSURE TO PROVIDE SHORT-TERM RETURNS HAD INCREASED OVER THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS. WE ALSO KNOW PUBLICLY HELD COMPANIES FACING PRESSURE FROM SHAREHOLDERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO INVEST IN GROWTH THE CON -- GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES THAN THEIR PRIVATELY HELD COUNTERPARTS. LARGE PUBLIC COMPANIES NOW RETURN EIGHT OR NINE OUT OF EVERY $10 THEY EARN DIRECTLY BACK TO SHAREHOLDERS. EITHER IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OR SCOTT -- STOCK BUYBACKS THAT CAN TEMPORARILY BOOST SHARE PRICES. LAST YEAR, THE TOTAL REACHED A RECORD 900 BILLION DOLLARS. THAT DOES NOT LEAVE MUCH MONEY TO BUILD A NEW FACTORY OR BUILD A RESEARCH LAB OR TRAIN WORKERS OR GIVE THEM A RAISE. IN FACT, ACCORDING TO ""THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"" WHILE TYPICAL COMPANIES IN THE S&P 500 DOUBLED THE SHARE OF CASH FLOW, THEY SPENT ON DIVIDENDS AND STOCK BUYBACKS, THEY ACTUALLY CUT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ON THINGS LIKE NEW PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT. AS A FOUNDER OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY VANGUARD PUT IT, A CULTURE OF SHORT-TERM SPECULATION HAS RUN RAMPANT. ONE OTHER CONCERNED BUSINESS LEADER CALLS IT QUARTERLY CAPITALISM. I UNDERSTAND THAT MOST CEO'S ARE SIMPLY RESPONDING TO VERY REAL PRESSURES FROM SHAREHOLDERS AND THE MARKETS TO TURN IN GOOD QUARTERLY NUMBERS. AND INVESTORS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A STRONG, RELIABLE RETURNS. BUT IT IS CLEAR THE SYSTEM IS OUT OF BALANCE. THE DECK IS STACKED INTO MANY WAYS, AND POWERFUL PRESSURES AND INCENTIVES ARE PUSHING IT EVEN FURTHER OUT OF BALANCE. QUARTERLY CAPITALISM IS NEITHER LEGALLY REQUIRED NOR ECONOMICALLY SOUND. IT IS BAD FOR BUSINESS, BAD FOR WAGES, AND BAD FOR OUR ECONOMY. AND FIXING IT WILL BE GOOD FOR EVERYONE. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF BUSINESS LEADERS, INVESTORS, AND ACADEMICS ARE MOBILIZING TO CHANGE THE CULTURE OF BOARDROOMS, CLASSROOMS, AND TRADING FLOORS AND TO BETTER ALIGN INCENTIVES FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH. FOR THE SAKE OF OUR ECONOMY AND OUR COUNTRY, WE NEED TO STAND WITH THEM. INNOVATORS LIKE GOOGLE AND SPACEX ARE INVESTING IN RESEARCH THAT DOES LITTLE FOR TODAY'S BOTTOM LINE, BUT MAY YIELD TRANSFORMATIONAL BENEFITS DOWN THE LINE. VENTURE CAPITALISTS ARE PATIENTLY NURTURING THE NEXT DISRUPTIVE INNOVATORS. THE BIG THREE AUTOMAKERS -- GM, FORD, AND CHRYSLER -- A PUTTING THE MEMORY OF THE CRISIS BEHIND THEM AND PUTTING NEW INVESTMENTS IN FACTORIES AND TECHNOLOGIES OF THE FUTURE, INCLUDING ADVANCED BATTERIES. COMPANIES LIKE TRADER JOE'S AND QUICK TRIP THAT INVEST IN WORKERS",Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton Remarks on the Economy

A SOURCE OF AMERICAN STRENGTH AROUND THE WORLD. THROUGHOUT HER LIFE, SHE HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND EQUALITY, WORKING TO MAKE OUR WORLD A MORE PEACEFUL AND INCLUSIVE PLACE FOR ALL. SHE HAS LED THE FIGHT ON SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES OF OUR TIME, FROM EDUCATION TO HEALTH CARE, AND GOTTEN RESULTS TO BRING US CLOSER TO AN AMERICA WHERE ALL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED. PLEASE JOIN ME AND WELCOMING HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.  CLINTON: THANK YOU SO MUCH, IOWA.  THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU SO MUCH.  CLINTON: IT IS A GREAT DELIGHT TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU AND WITH MY FELLOW CANDIDATES. I WANT TO CONGRATULATE ALL THE INDUCTEES. ANDY, THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO BRING BACK THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN IOWA.  CLINTON: JUST LOOK AROUND THIS ROOM AND YOU CAN SEE THAT DEMOCRATS ARE UNITED, ENERGIZED, AND WE ARE READY TO WIN THIS ELECTION.  CLINTON: I KNOW, AND YOU DO AS WELL, THAT ELECTIONS ARE ALWAYS ABOUT THE FUTURE. THIS TIME I FEEL THAT EVEN MORE POWERFULLY. MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY HAS WORKED SO HARD TO COME BACK FROM THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LEADERSHIP AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE ARE STANDING AGAIN.  CLINTON: BUT WE ARE NOT YET RUNNING THE WAY AMERICA SHOULD. AND NOW WE HAVE TO CHOOSE WHETHER WE ARE GOING TO RETURN TO THE FAILED TOP-DOWN POLICIES THAT WRECKED OUR ECONOMY BEFORE OR MOVE FORWARD TO CHART A STRONGER, FAIRER, AND MORE PROSPEROUS FUTURE. MAYBE IT IS THE GRANDMOTHER IN ME, BUT THIS IS DEEPLY PERSONAL. THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT BECOMING A GRANDPARENT. IT IS TRULY TRANSFORMATIONAL. SOME OF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. IT ANCHORS YOU IN THE PRESENT, AND YOU SUDDENLY HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE, AMAZING LITTLE PERSON WHO COMMANDS A LOT OF ATTENTION. IT ALSO FORCES YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE IN A NEW WAY. WHAT KIND OF WORLD WILL BE WAITING FOR HER? WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WILL WE HAVE WHEN SHE BECOMES AN ADULT? AND WHAT ARE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO SHAPE IT? I'M THINKING A LOT THESE DAYS ABOUT MY OWN MOTHER AND WHAT SHE DID FOR ME. ABANDONED, MISTREATED BY HER OWN FAMILY, SHE WAS OUT ON HER OWN BY 14, WORKING AS A HOUSEMAID, BUT SHE DID NOT GET INTO BITTERNESS OR DESPAIR, AND I REMEMBER ASKING HER, HOW DID YOU KEEP YOUR RESILIENCE? HOW DID YOU KEEP YOUR FAITH IN THE GOODNESS OF PEOPLE AND A FUTURE THAT WOULD BE BETTER THAN THE PAST? HERE IS WHAT SHE SAID. SOMEONE ALONG THE WAY BELIEVED SHE MATTERED. THE FIRST GRADE TEACHER WHO SOUGHT SHE HAD NOTHING TO EAT AT LUNCH, AND WITHOUT EMBARRASSING HER BROUGHT EXTRA FOOD TO SHARE. THE WOMAN WHOSE HOUSE SHE CLEANED SUGGESTING SHE GO TO HIGH SCHOOL SO LONG AS HER WORK WAS DONE. AND BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE BELIEVED IN HER, SHE WAS ABLE TO BELIEVE IN ME. SHE WAS ABLE TO GIVE ME THE GREAT GIFT OF BELIEVING IN OTHERS AND IN OUR COUNTRY. SO MY MOM WAS NOT SURPRISED THAT MY FIRST JOB OUT OF LAW SCHOOL WAS AT THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. SHE WASN'T SURPRISED THAT I SPENT MY LIFE FIGHTING FOR WOMEN, CHILDREN, FAMILIES, AND OUR COUNTRY.  AFTER ALL, THAT IS WHAT SHE TAUGHT ME TO DO. SHE NEVER STOP PUSHING ME TO FIGHT HARDER FOR OTHERS, TO HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES SHE NEVER HAD. I CAN STILL HEAR HER SAYING, LIFE IS NOT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU, IT'S ABOUT WHAT YOU DO WITH WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU, SO GET ACT OUT THERE. THAT IS WHY I AM HERE WITH YOU TODAY. -- SO GET BACK OUT THERE. THAT IS WHY I AM HERE WITH YOU TODAY.  THAT IS WHY I AM SO DETERMINED TO BUILD A BETTER FUTURE, NOT JUST FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER, BUT FOR ALL OF OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. THAT IS WHY I'M NEVER GOING TO LET A REPUBLICAN REP AWAY THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE.  CLINTON: YOU KNOW, WE DEMOCRATS ARE IN THE FUTURE BUSINESS. BUT FROM THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT, WE SEE THE OPPOSITE. THEY MAY HAVE SOME FRESH FACES, BUT THEY ARE THE PARTY OF THE PAST. WE DEMOCRATS, WE LOOK AT AMERICA AND WE SEE LIMITLESS POTENTIAL. WE BELIEVE IN A A SICK BARGAIN. IF YOU WORK HARD AND DO YOUR PART, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. WE BELIEVE THAT THE MEASURE OF OUR SUCCESS SHOULD BE HOW MUCH INCOMES RISE FOR HARD-WORKING FAMILIES, NOT JUST FOR CEOS AND MONEY MANAGERS.  WELL, REPUBLICANS BELIEVE SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT. THEIR ANSWER IS ALWAYS THE SAME, CUT TAXES FOR THE SUPER WEALTHY LET BIG CORPORATIONS WRITE THEIR OWN RULES, THAT'S IT. TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE WORST IDEAS OF THE 1980'S.  IT IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH NEW COKE, SHOULDER PADS, AND BIG HAIR.   CLINTON: I LIVED THROUGH IT. THERE ARE PHOTOGRAPHS, AND WE ARE NOT GOING BACK TO THAT.  CLINTON: THIS PAST MONDAY, I LAID OUT AN AGENDA FOR RAISING INCOMES SO HARD-WORKING AMERICANS CAN AFFORD A MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. IT IS AN AGENDA FOR STRONG GROWTH, FAIR GROWTH, AND LONG-TERM GROWTH. THAT WILL BE MY MISSION FROM THE FIRST DAY I AM PRESIDENT TO THE LAST. THIS CAMPAIGN HAS TO BE ABOUT HOW WE UNLOCK THE POTENTIAL OF EVERY AMERICAN. BECAUSE THAT IS HOW WE UNLOCK THE POTENTIAL OF AMERICA ITSELF. I AM HAVING --  CLINTON: I'M HAVING A GREAT DEBATE ALREADY WITH REPUBLICANS ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS FOR OUR COUNTRY. GOVERNOR BUSH SCRAMBLED TO EXPLAIN HIS STATEMENT THAT AMERICANS NEED TO WORK LONGER HOURS. HE NOW SAYS HE JUST WANTS PART-TIME WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO FIND FULL-TIME JOBS. WELL, SO DO I. THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM. HIS POLICIES AND THE POLICIES OF ALL THESE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WOULD MAKE THAT HARDER. GIVING MORE TAX CUTS TO THOSE AT THE TOP WON'T DO ANYTHING FOR PART-TIME WORKERS. ROLLING BACK RULES FOR WALL STREET WILL NOT HELP FAMILIES GET AHEAD. GETTING RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT CERTAINLY WON'T HELP ENTREPRENEURS. JUST ASK THE FOLKS IN THE SHARING ECONOMY. AMERICANS DON'T NEED LECTURES. THEY NEED RAISES.   SO IF REPUBLICANS REALLY WANT TO HELP US, WHY DON'T THEY JOIN US IN BREAKING DOWN THE BARRIERS SO MORE AMERICANS CAN ENTER AND SUCCEED IN THE WORK FORCE, ESPECIALLY WOMEN?  NOW, I KNOW THAT WHEN I TALK ABOUT THIS, SOME PEOPLE THINK, I CAN SEE IT IN THEIR EYES, THERE SHE GOES AGAIN WITH THE WOMEN'S ISSUES. WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO STOP, SO GET READY FOR A LONG CAMPAIGN.  YOU SEE, I HAVE THIS OLD FASHIONED IDEA WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LEAVE ANYONE ON THE SIDELINES. AND WOMEN WHO WANT TO WORK SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO WITHOUT WORRYING EVERY DAY ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILD OR WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF A FAMILY MEMBER GETS SICK. THAT'S NOT A LUXURY. IT'S A GROWTH STRATEGY. PAID LEAVE. EARNED SICK DAYS. CHILD CARE. MIN WAGE. THESE ARE NOT WOMEN'S ISSUES. THEY'RE FAMILY ISSUES. THEY'RE ECONOMIC ISSUES.  SO I WILL KEEP FIGHTING FOR THEM AND ASK YOU TO JOIN, AND I'M GOING TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR EQUAL PAY BECAUSE WHEN WOMEN GET SHORT CHANGED, FAMILIES GET SHORT CHANGED. WHEN FAMILIES GET SHORT CHANGED, OUR ECONOMY AND OUR COUNTRY GETS SHORT CHANGED. UNLOCKING POTENTIAL, THOUGH, GOES BEYOND DOLLARS AND CENTS. IT REALLY IS ABOUT OUR VALUES. HOW WE TREAT EACH OTHER. THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE WANT TO BUILD. ON THAT HISTORIC DAY, LAST MONTH, WHEN MARRIAGE EQUALITY BECAME THE LAW OF THE LAND, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WERE COMPLAINING, NOT CHEERING. WE EVEN HEARD A CALL FOR ABOLISHING THE SUPREME COURT, ITSELF. INSTEAD OF TRYING TO TURN THE CLOCK BACK, REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE JOINING US IN SAYING LOUDLY AND CLEARLY, NO TO DISCRIMINATION ONCE AND FOR ALL.  LGBT AMERICANS SHOULD BE FREE, NOT JUST TO MARRY, BUT TO LIVE, LEARN, AND WORK JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.   AND THEN THERE'S IMMIGRATION. WE'VE HEARD A LOT RECENTLY FROM THE NEW REPUBLICAN FRONT-RUNNER. DONALD TRUMP. FINALLY, A CANDIDATE WHOSE HAIR GETS MORE ATTENTION THAN MINE.  BUT THERE IS NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT THE HATE HE IS SPEWING TOWARD IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IT REALLY IS SHAMEFUL. AND SO IS THE FACT THAT IT TOOK WEEKS FOR MOST OF HIS FELLOW REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES TO STAND UP TO HIM. THE SAD TRUTH IS, IF YOU LOOK AT MANY OF THEIR POLICIES, IT IS HARD TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE. JUST LOOK ACROSS THE BORDER IN WISCONSIN. GOVERNOR WALKER KICKED OFF HIS CAMPAIGN BY ROLLING BACK REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS FOR WOMEN AND STRIPPING UNION WORKERS OF THEIR RIGHTS. WE DON'T KNEAD ANY MORE POLITICIANS WHO SHAME AND BLAME WOMEN FOR MAKING OUR OWN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH DECISIONS OR ATTACKING UNIONS FOR FIGHTING FOR MIDDLE CLASS JOBS.   AND I KNOW THERE ARE CHALLENGES RIGHT HERE IN IOWA BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO ME ABOUT THEM. JUST LISTEN TO THIS. IOWA HAS FEWER THAN 750 BEDS FOR MORE THAN 128,000 PEOPLE IN YOUR STATE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESSES. FAMILIES WORRY ABOUT RELATIVES WHO NEED HELP APP CAN'T GET IT. THE IOWANS I'VE TALKED TO DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOUR GOVERNOR WOULD VETO A BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE WITHOUT FUNDING A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE. AND THAT'S NOT ALL. THE GOVERNMENT ALSO SAID NO TO INVESTING IN IOWA STUDENTS, TEACHERS, AND SCHOOLS. SO TONIGHT I'M ADDING MY VOICE TO YOURS. GOVERNOR BRAN STEAD, PUT DOWN YOUR VETO PEN.  IOWA FAMILIES DON'T NEED A STAND OFF. THEY NEED SOLUTIONS. THAT'S WHY WE CAN'T LET REPUBLICANS TAKE US BACK LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO DO. WE ARE NOT GOING BACK TO TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS OR THE WILD WEST ON WALL STREET. WE'RE NOT GOING BACK TO INSURANCE COMPANIES CHARGING WOMEN MORE FOR THE SAME COVERAGE. WE'RE NOT GOING BACK TO DENYING CLIMATE CHANGE. IF YOU ASK MOST OF THESE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES ABOUT THAT, THEY'LL SAY, SORRY. I'M NOT A SCIENTIST. WELL, THEN WHY DON'T THEY START LISTENING TO THOSE WHO ARE SCIENTISTS? LOOK, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST EITHER. I'M JUST A GRANDMOTHER WITH TWO EYES AND A BRAIN AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET THEM TAKE US BACKWARDS. SO, PLEASE. IOWA DEMOCRATS JOIN ME. LET'S BUILD UP OUR PARTY IN EVERY CORNER OF THIS STATE AND COUNTRY. ELECT DEMOCRATS AT EVERY LEVEL. TAKE BACK SCHOOL BOARDS AND STATE HOUSES ALL THE WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE. I'M RUNNING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY WORK FOR YOU AND FOR EVERY AMERICAN FOR THE STRUGGLING, THE STRIVING, AND THE SUCCESSFUL, FOR THE FACTORY WORKERS AND THE FOOD SERVERS WHO TOOK CARE OF US TONIGHT. FOR THE FARMERS WHO FEED US AND THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO TAKE A RISK. FOR THE NURSES WHO WORK THE NIGHT SHIFT AND THE TRUCKERS WHO DRIVE FOR HOURS. I AM RUNNING FOR EVERYONE WHO'S EVER BEEN KNOCKED DOWN BUT REFUSED TO BE KNOCKED OUT. I'M RUNNING FOR YOU. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD AN AMERICA WHERE WE DON'T LEAVE ANYONE OUT OR ANYONE BEHIND. WHERE IF YOU WORK HARD YOU WILL DO YOUR PART AND GET AHEAD AND WHERE A FATHER CAN TELL HIS DAUGHTER, YES. YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO BE, EVEN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.   HILLARY! HILLARY! HILLARY! >> I AM NOW EXCITED TO WELCOME TO THE STAGE OUR NEXT KEYNOTE SPEAKER MARTIN O'MALLEY.

FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR TEACHING. II AM CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING YOUR TEACHERS AND THERE STUDENTS IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM BECAUSE I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE ARE RECOGNIZING THE CHALLENGES THAT KIDS BRING THE SCHOOL THESE DAYS THAT HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED BY A TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM OR THE TEACHER IN THE SPECIALTY PROGRAM LIKE SPECIAL ED. I BELIEVEI BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT WE HAVE GOT TO DO MORE TO SUPPORT WHAT WORKS IN SCHOOL. ANDSCHOOL. AND WHAT WORKS IS RECOGNIZING WHAT OUR JOB THIS IS FOR SO MANY TEACHERS WITH SO MANY KIDS. YOU KNOW, I HAVE A GREAT FRIEND, ONE OF MY FRIENDS FROM SIX. UTAH FOR 35 OR 40 YEARS AND RETIRED A MASTER ALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BEGINNING OF YOUR TEACHING CAREER IN THE END OF YOUR TEACHING CAREER? AND SHE TAUGHT IN A SUBURB OF CHICAGO. SHE SAID, A LOT MORE KIDS WITH PROBLEMS CAN BE SCHOOL THAT DID NOT REALLY HAVE ANY SUPPORT AND I HAD A DIFFICULT TIME TRYING TO HELP THEM. NUMBER TWO,. NUMBER TWO, I FELT LIKE EVERY KID THAT I TAUGHT HAD A LITTLE REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE AND MEMBRANE AND THEY WERE TURNING THE OFF ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY WERE SO USED TO QUICKNESS AND FAST RESPONSES. THE SLOW, HARD, SOMETIMES BORING WORK OF LEARNING SOMETHING WAS JUST HARD FOR THEM TO CONCENTRATE ON AND GRASP. HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO SAY. I WANT TO SUPPORT THOSE TRIED-AND-TRUE RESEARCH PROVEN APPROACHES THAT HELPED YOU AS A TEACHER DO THE BEST JOB YOU CAN. HELP YOUR STUDENTS TO SUCCEED TO THE BEST OF THERE ABILITY TO HELP THE SCHOOL YOUR IN TO BE A SUCCESS. AND I HERE THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN SO FOCUSED ON TEST TAKING TO THE EXCLUSION OF NEARLY EVERYTHING ELSE AND REALLY BELIEVE --  I BELIEVE IN TESTS. THEY SHOULD BE DIAGNOSTIC. A GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES. GATHER EVIDENCE ABOUT HOW MANY CHILDREN IN OUR COUNTRY WERE NOT IN SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF DISABILITY. WE FORGET THOSE DAYS. I KNOCKED ON DOORS SAYING DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT IN SCHOOL? AND I BLIND CHILDREN DEAF CHILDREN. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROMISED IT WOULD PAY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PAID ABOUT 17%. BUT WE HAVE HAVE DONE IS TO SAY WE WANT YOU TO EDUCATE ALL THE CHILDREN THE OTHER THING WE DIDN'T DO IS TO RECOGNIZE IT IS IMPORTANT THIS IS SOMETHING I WORKED ON EVER SINCE I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL. ITIT STRUCK WE AS YOU ARE LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS, FACTORY WORKERS HAVE TO MAKE SURE KIDS GO TO SCHOOL. GOOD HABITS FOR THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF DISCIPLINE AND LOVE WITH THE GUIDANCE THEY NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. 80 PERCENT OF YOUR BRAIN IS PHYSICALLY FORMED BY THE ADVISORY. HAVE BEEN SINCE SHE WAS A WEEK OLD. SO BILL THE OTHER DAY, ENOUGH WITH THE READING, TALKING, ANSWERING WE DO THIS I CRAZY AND THEN WE HAVE OTHER LITTLE KIDS WHO HAVE A LOT HARDER TIME. THEY MAY NOT HAVE TWO PARENTS IN THE HOME AND MAYBE WORKING LIKE CRAZY. THEY MAY HAVE DIFFICULTIES WITH DRUGS OR ALCOHOL OR OTHER PROBLEMS. BY THE TIME MY LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTER IS TO KINDERGARTEN,JUST TO KINDERGARTEN, THE RESEARCH SHOWS SHE WE WILL HAVE HEARD 30 MILLION MORE WORDS THAN A CHILDLESS ADVENTIST BACKGROUND. I WANT YOU TO BE THE TEACHER. PUT YOURSELF IN THE TEACHERS POSITION. HERE IS LITTLE CHARLOTTE AND SINCE SHE DOES HAVE SOME CLINTON JAMES A PROBLEM IS SHE'S TALKING TOO MUCH. THINK ABOUTTHINK ABOUT LITTLE CHARLIE HAD JUST AS MUCH POTENTIAL LOST A LINE JUST AS MUCH, BUT AS VOCABULARY IS NOWHERE NEAR WHAT IT COULD BE. WHICH UNDER THE TEACHER AND SAY FROM THE 1st DAY OF KINDERGARTEN YET THIS ACHIEVEMENT GAP. YOU GO FIX IT. WE WILL.FINGERS AT YOU IF YOU DON'T. THAT IS NOT RIGHT. THAT IS JUST NOT RIGHT.

THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THANKS TO EVERYONE AT THE NEW SCHOOL FOR WELCOMING US TODAY. I I AM DELIGHTED TO BE BACK. I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LISTEN TO AMERICANS CONCERNED ABOUT AN THE ECONOMY THAT STILL IS NOT DELIVERING FOR THEM, NOT THE WAY IT SHOULD. IT STILL SEEMS TO MOST AMERICANS THAT IT IS STACKED FOR THOSE AT THE TOP. I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE HOPES THAT PEOPLE HAVE FOR THEIR FUTURES, STARTING SMALL BUSINESS THEY HAVE ALWAYS DREAMED ABOUT, GETTING A JOB THAT PAYS WELL ENOUGH TO SIT OR A FAMILY AND PROVIDE FOR A SECURE RETIREMENT. PREVIOUS GENERATIONS BUILT THE GREATEST ECONOMY AND STRONGEST MIDDLE-CLASS THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN ON THE PROMISE OF A BASIC BARGAIN -- IF YOU WORK HARD AND DO YOUR PART, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET AHEAD. WHEN YOU GET AHEAD, AMERICA GETS AHEAD. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES, THAT BARGAIN HAS ERODED. OUR JOB IS TO ME IT STRONG AGAIN. FOR 35 YEARS, REPUBLICANS HAVE ARGUED THAT IF WE GIVE MORE WEALTH TO THOSE AT THE TOP, BY CUTTING THEIR TAXES, IT WILL TRICKLE DOWN TO EVERYONE ELSE. EVERY TIME THEY HAD A CHANCE TO TRY THAT APPROACH, IT EXPLODES THE NATIONAL DEBT, CONCENTRATES WEALTH EVEN MORE, AND IS PRACTICALLY NOTHING TO HELP HARD-WORKING AMERICANS. TWICE NOW IN THE PAST 20 YEARS A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT HAS HAD TO COM EINE IN AND CLEAN UP THE MESS LEFT BEHIND.   I THINK THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA -- CLINTON -- I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT --AMERICA SAW THE LARGEST PEACETIME EXPANSION IN OUR HISTORY.   NEARLY 23 MILLION JOBS, A BALANCED BUDGET, AND A SURPLUS FOR THE FUTURE. INCOMES ROSE ACROSS THE BOARD NOT JUST FOR THOSE ALREADY AT THE TOP. EIGT YEARS LATER PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE' HARD WORDK HOLD US BACK FROM THE BRINK OF DEPRESSION. PRESIDENT OBAMA SEE THE AUTO INDUSTRY AND PROVIDED HEALTH CARE TO TEEN MILLION AMERICANS -- TO 16 MILLION AMERICANS.   NOW, TODAY IS THE SHADOW OF-- AS THE SHADOW OF CRISES RECEDE, I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO BUILD A GROWTH AND FAIRNESS ECONOMY. YOU CANNOT HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER. WE CANNOT CREATE ENOUGH JOBS WITHOUT MORE GROWTH. AND WE CANNOT WILL STRONG FAMILIES AND SUPPORT OUR CONSUMER ECONOMY WITHOUT MORE FAIRNESS. WE NEED BOTH. AMERICA STANDING AGAIN, WE ARE NOT YET RUNNING THE WAY WE SHOULD. CORPORATE PROFITS ARE NEAR RECORD HIGHS. AMERICANS ARE WORKING AS HARD AS EVER. BUT PAYCHECKS HAD NEARLY BUDGED IN REAL TERMS. FAMILIES TODAY ARE STRETCHED IN SO MANY DIRECTIONS, AND SO ARE THERE BUDGETS. HEALTH CARE, CHILDCARE, HEARING FOR AGING PARENTS ARE RISING A LOT FASTER THAN WAGES. I HERE THIS EVERYWHERE I GO. A SINGLE MOM TALKED ABOUT JUGGLING A JOB IN CLASS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHILE RAISING THREE KIDS. SHE DOESN'T EXPECT ANYTHING TO COME EASY. IF SHE GOT A RAISE, EVERYTHING WOULD NOT BE QUITE SO HARD. THE GRANDMOTHER WHO WORKS AROUND THE CLOCK PROVIDING CHILDCARE TO OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS. THE PAY IS FAIRLY ENOUGH TO LIVE ON, ESPECIALLY WITH THE SOARING PRICE OF HER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THE YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR OF DREAM OF BUYING THE LOCAL BOWLING ALLEY WAS NEARLY DERAILED BY STUDENT DEBT. IF HE CAN GROW HIS BUSINESS, HE CAN PAY OFF HIS DEBT AND HIS EMPLOYEES MORE, TOO. WAGES NEED TO RISE TO KEEP UP WITH COST. PAYCHECKS NEED TO GROW. FAMILIES WHO WORK HARD AND DO THEIR PART DESERVE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. OF THE DEFINING ECONOMIC CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME CLEAR. WE MUST RAISE INCOMES FOR HARD-WORKING AMERICANS SO THEY CAN AFFORD A MIDDLE-CLASS L IFEIFE. WE MUST DRIVE STEADY INCOME GROWTH THAT LIFTS UP FAMILIES, AND THAT --   AND THAT WILL BE MY MISSION, FROM THE FIRST DAY I AM PRESIDENT TO THE LAST. I --   I WILL GET UP EVERY DAY THINKING ABOUT THE FAMILIES OF AMERICA, LIKE THE FAMILY I CAME FROM, A HARD-WORKING DAD STARTED A SMALL BUSINESS AND GAVE US A GOOD MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. I WILL BE THINKING ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT IN NEW YORK AND THE STORIES THEY TOLD ME AND THAT I WORKED WITH THEN IMPROVE. I WILL TAKE ON THIS CHALLENGE AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF MAJOR CHANGES IN OUR ECONOMY THAT DID NOT START WITH THE RECESSION AND WILL NOT END WITH THE RECOVERY. ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY HAS CREATED NEW AREAS OF COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY AND OPENED NEW MARKETS FOR EXPORTS. TOO OFTEN THEY ARE POLARIZING OUR ECONOMY, BENEFITING HIGH SKILLED WORKERS BUT DOWNGRADING BLUE-COLLAR JOBS AND OTHER MID-LEVEL JOBS THAT USED TO PROVIDE SOLID INCOME FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. TODAY'S MARKETPLACE FOCUSES TOO MUCH ON THE SHORT-TERM, LIKE SECOND TO SECOND FINANCIAL TRADING, AND TOO LITTLE ON LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS. MANY AMERICANS ARE MAKING EXTRA MONEY RENTING OUT A SMALL ROOM, SELLING PRODUCTS THEY DESIGN THEMSELVES AT HOME OR DRIVING THEIR OWN CAR. THIS SO-CALLED GIG ECONOMY IS CREATING EXCITING ECONOMIES AND UNLEASHING INNOVATION. IT IS ALSO RAISING HARD QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT A GOOD JOB WILL LOOK LIKE TEACHER. ALL OF THESE TRENDS ARE REAL AND NONE IS GOING AWAY. BUT THEY DO NOT DETERMINE OUR DESTINY. THE CHOICES WE MAKE AS A NATION MATTER. AND THE CHOICES WE MAKE WILL SET THE STAGE FOR WHAT AMERICAN LIFE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS IN OUR ECONOMY WILL BE LIKE IN THIS CENTURY. AS PRESIDENT I WILL WORK WITH EVERY POSSIBLE PARTNER TO TURN THE TIDE TO MAKE THESE CURRENTS OF CHANGE WORKING FOR US, TO STRENGTHEN THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS. I THINK AT OUR BEST THAT IS WHAT AMERICANS DO. WE ARE PROBLEM SOLVERS. WE DO NOT HIDE FROM CHANGE. THE MEASURE OF OUR SUCCESS MUST BE HOW MUCH INCOMES RISE FOR HARD-WORKING FAMILIES, NOT JUST FOR SUCCESSFUL CEO'S AND MONEY MANAGERS AND NOT SOME ARBITRARY GROWTH TARGETS UNCOVERED TWO PEOPLE -- UNTETHERED TO PEOPLE'S LIVES LIVELIHOODS.   I WANT TO SEE OUR ECONOMY WORK FOR THE STRUGGLING, THE STRIVING, AND THE SUCCESSFUL. WE ARE NOT GOING TO FIND ALL THE ANSWERS WE NEED TODAY IN THE PLAYBOOKS OF THE PAST. WE CANNOT GO BACK TO THE OLD POLICIES THAT FAILED US BEFORE, NOR CAN WE JUST REPLAY THE SUCCESSES. TODAY IS NOT 1993 OR 2009. SO WE NEED SOLUTIONS FOR THE BIG CHALLENGES WE FACE NOW. I AM PROPOSING AN AGENDA TO RAISE INCOMES, FOR STRONG GROWTH, THEIR GROWTH, AND LONG-TERM GROWTH. MORE GROWTH MEANS MORE JOBS AND MORE NEW BUSINESSES. MORE JOBS GET PEOPLE CHOICES ABOUT WHERE TO WORK. EMPLOYERS HAVE TO OFFER BETTER THAN IF IT'S TO COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER TO HIGHER NEW WORKERS -- TO HIRE NEW WORKERS. GETTING CLOSER TO FULL EMPLOYMENT IS CRUCIAL FOR RAISING INCOMES. SMALL BUSINESSES CREATE MORE THAN 60% OF NEW AMERICAN JOBS. AND A HALF TO BE A TOP PRIORITY. I WANT TO BE THE SMALL BUSINESS PRESIDENT, AND I MEAN IT. I I'M GOING TO BE TALKING HOW WE EMPOWER ENTREPRENEURS EASIER ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND SIMPLIFICATION. I WILL PUSH OR BROADER BUSINESS TAX REFORM TO SPUR INVESTMENT IN AMERICA, CLOSING THE LOOPHOLES THAT REWARD COMPANIES TOTHAT SEND JOBS AND PROFITS OVERSEAS.   AND I KNOW IT IS NOT ALWAYS HOW WE THINK ABOUT THIS. ANOTHER ENGINE OF STRONG GROWTH SHOULD BE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM.    I WANT YOU TO HEAR THIS. BRINGING MILLIONS OF HARD-WORKING PEOPLE INTO THE FORMAL ECONOMY WOULD INCREASE OUR GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT BY AN ESTIMATED 700 EARLY IN DOLLARS OVER -- $700 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS. THEN THERE ARE THE -- WHEN WE GET AMERICANS MOVING WE GET OUR COUNTRY MOVING. LET'S ESTABLISHED AN INFRASTRUCTURE BANK THAT CAN CHANNEL MORE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FUNDS.   CHANNEL THOSE FUNDS TO FINANCE WORLD-CLASS AIRPORTS, RAILWAYS, ROADS, AND BRIDGES, AND PORTS.   AND LET'S BUILT THOSE FASTER BROADBAND NETWORKS AND MAKE SURE THERE IS A GREATER DIVERSITY OF PROVIDERS SO CONSUMERS HAVE MORE CHOICE.   AND THERE IS NO EXCUSE NOT TO ME GREATER INVESTMENTS IN CLEANER RENEWABLE ENERGY RIGHT NOW.   OUR ECONOMY RUNS ON ENERGY AND THE TIME HAS COME TO MAKE AMERICA THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER. THESE INVESTMENTS WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS, SAVE US MONEY IN THE LONG RUN, AND HELP US MEET THE THREATS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. LET'S FUND THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT SPAWNED INNOVATIVE COMPANIES AND CREATES ENTIRE NEW INDUSTRIES, JUST AS THE PROJECT TO SEQUENCE THE HUMAN GENOME DID IN THE 1990'S AND PRESIDENT OBAMA'S INITIATIVES ON PRECISION MEDICINE WILL DO IN THE COMING YEARS. I WILL SET AMBITIOUS GOALS IN ALL OF THESE AREAS IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. LET ME EMPHASIZE ANOTHER KEY INGREDIENT OF STRONG GROWTH THAT OFTEN GOES OVERLOOKED. BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS SO MORE AMERICANS PARTICIPATE MORE FULLY IN THE WORKFORCE, ESPECIALLY WOMEN.     WE ARE IN A GLOBAL COMPETITION, AS I AM SURE YOU HAVE NOTICED. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LEAVE TALENT ON THE SIDELINE. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING TODAY. WHEN WE LEAVE PEOPLE OUT, WE SHORTCHANGE THEN AND WE SHORTCHANGE OUR COUNTRY AND OUR FUTURE. THE MOVEMENT OF WOMEN INTO THE AMERICAN WORKFORCE OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN $3.5 TRILLION IN ECONOMIC GROWTH. BUT THAT PROGRESS HAS STALLED. THE UNITED STATES USED TO RANK SEVEN OUT OF 24 ADVANCED COUNTRIES IN WOMEN'S LABOR FORCE OR DISSIPATION. BY 2013, WE HAD DROPPED TO 19. THAT REPRESENTS A LOT OF UNUSED POTENTIAL FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES. STUDIES SHOW NEARLY ONE THIRD OF THIS DECLINE RELATIVE TO OTHER COUNTRIES IS BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPANDING FAMILY-FRIENDLY POLICIES LIKE A LEAVE, AND WE ARE NOT. WE SHOULD BE MAKING IT EASIER FOR AMERICANS TO BE GOOD WORKERS AND CAREGIVERS. WOMEN WHO WANT TO WORK SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HOW THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN ARE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF A FAMILY MEMBER GETS SICK. LAST YEAR --   LAST YEAR WHILE I WAS AT THE HOSPITAL IN MANHATTAN WAITING FOR CHARLOTTE TO MAKE A GRAND, ENTRANCE ONE OF THE NURSES SAID THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING FOR PAID LEAVE. SHE SEES FIRSTHAND WHAT IT MEANS FOR HERSELF AND HER COLLEAGUES AS WELL AS FOR THE WORKING PARENTS THAT SHE HELPS TAKE CARE OF. IT IS TIME TO RECOGNIZE THAT QUALITY CHILDCARE IS NOT A LUXURY. IT IS A GROWTH STRATEGY. IT IS PAST TIME TO END THE OUTRAGE OF SO MANY WOMEN EARNING LESS THAN MEN ON THE JOB, AND WOMEN OF COLOR MAKING EVEN LESS.    ALL THIS LOST MONEY AND IT'S UP -- ADDS UP, FOR SOME WOMEN IT IS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. FOR FAR TOO LONG, THESE CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN DISMISSED BY SOME AS WOMEN'S ISSUES. WELL, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.  >>  FAIR PAY AND FAIR SCHEDULING AND EARNED SICK DAYS, CHILDCARE ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR COMPETITIVENESS AND OUR GROWTH. AND WE CAN DO THIS IN WAY THAT DOES NOT IMPOSE UNFAIR BURDENS ON BUSINESSES. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL FIND TO PUT FAMILIES FIRST, JUST LIKE I HAVE MY ENTIRE CAREER.   BEYOND STRONG GROWTH, WE NEED FAIR GROWTH, AND THAT WILL BE THE SECOND KEY DRIVER OF RAISING INCOMES. THE EVIDENCE IS IN. INEQUALITY IS A DRAG ON OUR ENTIRE ECONOMY. SO THIS IS THE PROBLEM WE NEED TO TACKLE. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD GOVERNOR BUSH SAY AMERICANS JUST NEED TO WORK LONGER HOURS. WELL, HE MUST NOT HAVE MET VERY MANY AMERICAN WORKERS.    LET HIM TELL THAT TO THE NURSE WHO STANDS ON HER FEET ALL DAY WITH THE TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM OR THE TRUCKER WHO DRIVES ALL NIGHT, TO THE FAST WORKER MARCHING INDUSTRY FOR BETTER PAY. THEY DO NOT NEED A LECTURE. THEY NEED A RAISE.     THE TRUTH IS THE CURRENT RULES FOR OUR ECONOMY DO REWARD SOME WORK, LIKE FINANCIAL TRADING, MUCH MORE THAN OTHER WORK, LIKE ACTUALLY BUILDING AND SELLING THINGS, THE WORK THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY. TO GET ALL INCOMES RISING WE NEED TO STRIKE A BETTER BALANCE. IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU SHOULD BE A FAIRLY. WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW RULES ON OVERTIME AND THEN GO FURTHER.   I WILL CRACK DOWN ON BOSSES WHO EXPLOIT EMPLOYEES BY MS. CLASSIFYING THEM AS CONTRACTORS OR EVEN STEEL THEIR WAGES -- STEAL THEI WAGESR. WE NEED TO TAKE ON THE MAJOR STRAIN ON FAMILY BUDGETS. I WILL PROTECT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND BUILD ON IT TO LOWER OUT-OF-POCKET HEALTH CARE COSTS.   AND TO THEY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS -- AND TO MAY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS MORE AFFORDABLE WILL HELP FAMILIES FORWARD TO RETIREMENT BY DEFENDING AND ENHANCING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MAKING IT EASIER TO SAVE FOR THE FUTURE. MANY OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE TIME-TESTED AND MORE THAN A LITTLE BATTLE SCARRED. WE NEED NEW IDEAS, AS WELL, AND ONE I WILL FIGHT FOR HIS PROFIT-SHARING. HARD-WORKING AMERICANS DESERVE TO BENEFIT FROM THE RECORD CORPORATE EARNINGS THEY HELP PRODUCE. I WILL PRODUCE WAYS TO ENCOURAGE COMPANIES TO SHARE PROFITS WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES. THAT IS GOOD FOR WORKERS AND BUSINESSES. PROFIT SHARING GIVES EVERYONE A STAKE IN THE COMPANY'S SUCCESS CAN BOOST PRODUCTIVITY AND PUT MONEY DIRECTLY INTO EMPLOYEES' POICKETS. I WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT HOW WE DO THIS. ANOTHER PRIORITY MUST BE REFORMING OUR TAX CODE. WE HEAR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES TALK ABOUT TAX REFORM. BUT TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THEIR PLANS. SENATOR RUBIO'S WOULD CUT TAXES FOR HOUSEHOLD MAKING AROUND $3 MILLION A YEAR BY ALMOST $240,000, WHICH IS MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE EARNINGS OF A TYPICAL FAMILY. THAT IS A SURE BUDGET BUSTING GIVEAWAY TO THE SUPER WEALTHY AND THE KIND OF BAD ECONOMICS YOU ARE LIKELY TO HEAR FROM ANY OF THE CANDIDATES ON THE OTHER SIDE. I HAVE A DIFFERENT TAKE.   GUIDED LICENSE PRINCIPLES. HARD-WORKING FAMILIES NEED AND DESERVE TAX RELIEF AND SIMPLIFICATION. THOSE AT THE TOP HAVE TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. I SUPPORT THE BUFFET RULE, WHICH MAKE SURE MILLIONAIRES DO NOT PAY LOWER RATES THAN THEIR SECRETARIES. I HAVE CALLED FOR CLOSING THE LOOPHOLE THAT LETS WEALTHY FINANCIERS PAY AN ARTIFICIALLY LOW RATE. HUGELY SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES THAT BENEFIT SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GAME THE SYSTEM AND AVOID PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE, ESPECIALLY WHILE COMPANIES CANNOT AFFORD HIGH-PRICED LAWYERS END UP PAYING MORE. ALONGSIDE TAX REFORM IT IS TIME TO STAND UP TO EFFORTS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY TO UNDERMINE WORKER BARGAINING POWER. THIS HAS BEEN PROVEN AGAIN AND AGAIN TO DRIVE UP WAGES. REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS LIKE SCOTT WALKER HAVE MADE THEIR NAMES STOMPING ON WORKERS RIGHTS AND PRACTICALLY ALL REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WOULD DO THE SAME AS PRESIDENT. I WILL FIGHT BACK AGAINST THESE MEAN-SPIRITED MISGUIDED ATTACKS.   EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE DECLINE OF UNIONS MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A THIRD OF THE INCREASE OF ANY QUALITY AMONG MEN -- INEQUALITY AMONG MEN. WE HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT SUPPORTING UNION WORKERS.   LET ME JUST SAY A WORD ABOUT TRADE. THE GREEK CRISIS AS WELL AS THE CHINESE STOCK MARKET HAVE REMINDED US THAT GROWTH HERE AT HOME AND GROWTH AND OCEAN AWAY ARE LINKED IN A COMMON GLOBAL ECONOMY. TRADE HAS BEEN A MAJOR DRIVER OF THE ECONOMY OVER RECENT DECADES, BUT IT HAS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO HOLLOWING OUT OUR MANUFACTURING BASE AND MANY HARD-WORKING COMMUNITIES. WE NEED TO SET A HIGH BAR FOR TRADE AGREEMENTS. WE SHOULD SUPPORT THEM IF THEY CREATE JOBS, RAISE WAGES, AND INCREASE OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. WE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO WALK AWAY IF THEY DON'T. TO CREATE FAIR GROWTH, WE NEED TO CREATE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE AMERICANS. I LOVE THE SAYING BY ABRAHAM LINCOLN, WHO IN MANY WAYS WAS NOT ONLY THE PRESIDENT WHO SAVED OUR UNION, BUT THE PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTOOD PROFOUNDLY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF GOVERNMENT PLAYING ITS ROLE IN PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY. HE TALKED ABOUT GIVING AMERICANS A FAIR CHANCE IN THE RACE OF LIFE. I BELIEVE THAT WITH ALL MY HEART, BUT I ALSO BELIEVE IT HAS TO START REALLY EARLY, AT BIRTH. HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS, CAN SET CHILDREN ON THE COURSE FOR FUTURE SUCCESS AND RAISE LIFETIME INCOMES BY 25%. I AM COMMITTED TO SEEING EVERY FOUR-YEAR-OLD IN AMERICA HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY PRESCHOOL IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS. I WANT TO DO MORE. I WANT TO CALL FOR A GREAT OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT FROM OUR FAITH, BUSINESS, ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS, CIVIC GROUPS, AND CONCERNED CITIZENS, TO REALLY HELP PARENTS, PARTICULARLY PARENTS FACING A LOT OF OBSTACLES. TO REALLY HELP THEM PREPARE THEIR OWN CHILDREN IN THE ZERO TO FOUR AGE GROUP. 80% OF YOUR BRAIN IS PHYSICALLY FORMED BY THE AGE OF THREE. THAT IS WHY FAMILIES LIKE MINE READ, TALK, AND SAYING ENDLESSLY TO OUR GRANDDAUGHTER. WE HOPE HER FIRST WORDS WILL BE ENOUGH WITH IT TALKING AND SINGING. BUT WE DO IT NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE LOVE DOING IT EVEN KNOW I WILL ADMIT IT IS EMBARRASSING READING A BOOK TO A TWO OR SIX-WEEK-OLD, BUT WE DO IT BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND IT IS BUILDING HER CAPACITY FOR LEARNING. RESEARCH SHOWS BY THE TIME SHE ENTERS KINDERGARTEN, SHE WILL HAVE HEARD 30 MILLION MORE WORDS THAN A MILE -- A CHILD FROM A LESS ADVANTAGED BACKGROUND. THINK OF WHAT WE ARE LOSING BECAUSE WE ARE NOT DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO REACH OUT TO THOSE FAMILIES AND WE KNOW AGAIN FROM SO MUCH RESEARCH YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD THAT MENTORING AND INTERVENTION WILL HELP THOSE OFTEN STRESSED OUT YOUNG MOMS UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN DO AND TO AVOID THE DIFFICULTIES THAT STAND IN THE WAY OF THEIR BEING ABLE TO GET THEIR CHILD OFF TO THE BEST POSSIBLE START. WE ALSO HAVE TO INVEST IN OUR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS AT EVERY LEVEL. IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS, I WILL LAY OUT SPECIFIC CAP WILL COME UP A COVERAGE TRULY AFFORDABLE, AND HELP AMERICANS REFINANCE. HELLO LET'S EMBRACE THE IDEA OF LIFELONG LEARNING IN ILLOGICAL CHANGE, WE NEED TO PROVIDE PATHWAYS TO GET SKILLS AND CREDENTIALS FOR NEW OCCUPATIONS AND CREATE ONLINE PLATFORMS TO CONNECT WORKERS TO JOBS. THERE ARE EXCITING EFFORTS UNDERWAY AND I WANT TO SUPPORT AND SCALE THE ONES THAT SHOW RESULTS. AS WE PURSUE ALL OF THESE POLICIES, WE CANNOT FORGET OUR FELLOW AMERICANS HIT SO HARD AND LEFT BEHIND BY THIS CHANGING WORLD FROM THE INNER CITIES TO THE COUNTRY. TALENT IS UNIVERSAL, YOU FIND IT EVERYWHERE. OPPORTUNITY IS NOT. THERE ARE NEARLY 6 MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE AGED 16 TO 24 IN AMERICA TODAY WHO ARE NOT IN SCHOOL OR AT WORK. THE NUMBERS OF YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE PARTICULARLY STAGGERING. A QUARTER OF YOUNG BLACK MEN AND NEARLY 15% OF ALL LATINO YOUTH CANNOT FIND A JOB. WE HAVE TO HAVE A BETTER WAY OF COMING UP TO MATCH THE GROWING MIDDLE CLASS INCOME IF WE WANT TO GENERATE MORE PATHWAYS INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THE BEST ANTI-POVERTY PROGRAM IS A JOB BUT THAT'S HARD TO SAY IF THERE AREN'T ENOUGH JOBS FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO HELP LIFT THEMSELVES OUT OF POVERTY. THAT'S WHY I CALLED FOR REVIVING THE NEW MARKET TAX CREDIT AND EMPOWERMENT TO CREATE GREATER INCENTIVES TO INVEST IN POOR AND REMOTE AREAS.   WHEN ALL AMERICANS HAVE A CHANCE TO STUDY HARD, WORK HARD, AND SHARE IN OUR COUNTRY'S PROSPERITY, THAT IS FAIR GROWTH. IT'S WHAT I VOICE BELIEVED IN AND IT'S WHAT I WILL FIGHT FOR AS PRESIDENT. THE THIRD KEY DRIVER OF INCOME ALONGSIDE STRONG GROWTH AND FAIR GROWTH MUST BE LONG-TERM GROWTH. TOO MANY PRESSURES IN OUR ECONOMY PUSH US TOWARD SHORT-TERM ISM. THEY TALK TO ME ABOUT IT. ONE IS EVERYTHING FOCUSED ON THE NEXT EARNINGS REPORT OR THE SHORT-TERM SHARE PRICE AND THE RESULT IS TOO LITTLE ATTENTION ON THE SOURCES OF LONG-TERM GROWTH. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND TALENT. NET BUSINESS INVESTMENT WHICH INCLUDES THINGS LIKE FACTORIES, MACHINES, AND RESEARCH LABS, HAVE DECLINED AS A SHARE OF THE ECONOMY. IN RECENT YEARS SOME OF OUR BIGGEST COMPANIES HAVE SPENT MORE THAN HALF THEIR EARNINGS TO BUY BACK THEIR OWN STOCK AND ANOTHER THIRD OR MORE TO PAY DIVIDENDS. THAT DOESN'T LEAVE A LOT LEFD. -- LEFT. TO INVEST IN THE WORKERS THAT MADE THOSE PROFIT POSSIBLE OR TO MAKE NEW INVESTMENT NECESSARY TO ENSURE A COMPANY'S FUTURE SUCCESS. THESE TRENDS NEED TO CHANGE. I BELIEVE MANY BUSINESS LEADERS ARE EAGER TO EMBRACE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES, NOT JUST AT TODAY'S SHARE PRICE BUT ALSO TO WORKERS, COMMUNITIES, AND ULTIMATELY TO OUR COUNTRY AND OUR PLANET. I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT CHARITY, I AM TALKING ABOUT CLEAR CAPITALISM. MANY COMPANIES HAVE PROSPERED BY IMPROVING WAGES AND TRAINING THEIR WORKERS THAT THEN YIELD HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY, BETTER SERVICE, AND LARGER PROFITS. IT IS EASY TO TRY AND CUT COSTS BY HOLDING DOWN OR EVEN DECREASING PAY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS TO INFLATE QUARTERLY STOCK PRICES BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT IS BAD FOR BUSINESS IN THE LONG RUN AND IT IS REALLY BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY. WORKERS ARE ASSETS. INVESTING IN THEM PAYS OFF, HIGHER WAGES PAY OFF. TRAINING PAYS OFF. TO HELP MORE COMPANIES DO THAT I PROPOSE A $1500 TAX CREDIT FOR EVERY WORKER THEY TRAIN AND HIGHER. I WILL SOON BE PROPOSING A NEW PLAN TO REFORM CAPITAL GAINS TAXES TO REWARD LONGER-TERM INVESTMENTS THAT CREATE JOBS, MORE THAN JUST QUICK TRADES.   I WILL ALSO PROPOSE REFORMS TO HELP CEOS AND SHAREHOLDERS ALIKE TO FOCUS ON THE NEXT DECADE RATHER THAN JUST THE NEXT DAY.   MAKING SURE STOCK BUYBACKS ARE NOT BEING USED ONLY FOR AN IMMEDIATE BOOST IN SHARE PRICES. EMPOWERING OUTSIDE INVESTORS THAT WANT TO BUILD COMPANIES, BUT DISCOURAGING CUT AND RUN SHAREHOLDERS WHO ACT MORE LIKE OLD-SCHOOL CORPORATE RAIDERS, AND NOWHERE WILL THE SHIFT FROM SHORT-TERM TO LONG-TERM BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ON WALL STREET. AS A FORMER SENATOR FROM NEW YORK, I KNOW FIRSTHAND THE ROLE THAT WALL STREET CAN AND SHOULD PLAY IN OUR ECONOMY. HELPING MAIN STREET GROW AND PROSPER. AND BOOSTING NEW COMPANIES THAT MAKE AMERICA MORE COMPETITIVE GLOBALLY. BUT AS WE ALL KNOW IN THE YEARS BEFORE THE CRASH, FINANCIAL FIRMS PILED AT RISK UPON RISK. AND REGULATORS AND WASHINGTON EITHER COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT KEEP UP. I WAS ALARMED BY THIS GATHERING STORM AND CALLED FOR ADDRESSING THE RISKS OF DERIVATIVES, CRACKING DOWN ON SUBPRIME MORTGAGES AND IMPROVING FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT. UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LEADERSHIP WE HAVE IMPOSED TOUGH NEW RULES THAT DEAL WITH SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ON WALL STREET. THOSE RULES HAVE BEEN UNDER ASSAULT BY REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS AND THOSE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I WILL FIGHT BACK AGAINST THESE ATTACKS AND PROTECT THE REFORMS WE HAVE MADE. WE CAN DO THAT AND STILL EASE BURDENS ON COMMUNITY BANKS TO ENCOURAGE RESPONSIBLE LOANS TO LOCAL PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES THEY KNOW AND TRUST. WE ALSO HAVE TO GO BEYOND. FRANK -- DODD-FRANK. SOME INSTITUTIONS ARE STILL TOO COMPLEX AND RISKY. THE PROBLEMS ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE BIG BANKS THAT GET ALL THE HEADLINES. SERIOUS RISKS ARE EMERGING FROM INSTITUTIONS IN THE SO-CALLED SHADOW BANKING SYSTEM, INCLUDING HEDGE FUNDS, HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADERS, NON-BANK FINANCE COMPANIES. SO MANY NEW KINDS OF ENTITIES WHICH RECEIVE LITTLE OVERSIGHT AT ALL. STORIES OF MISCONDUCT BY INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY ARE SHOCKING. HSBC ALLOWING DRUG CARTELS TO LAUNDER MONEY, FIVE MAJOR BANKS PLEADING GUILTY TO FELONY CHARGES FOR CONSPIRING TO MANIPULATE CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES. THERE CAN BE NO JUSTIFICATION OR TOLERANCE FOR THIS KIND OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR.   WHILE INSTITUTIONS HAVE PAID LARGE FINES AND IN SOME CASES ADMITTED GUILT, TOO OFTEN IT HAS SEEMED THAT THE HUMAN BEINGS RESPONSIBLE GET OFF WITH LIMITED CONSEQUENCES OR NONE AT ALL, EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE ALREADY POCKETED THE GAMES. THIS IS WRONG. ON MY WATCH IT WILL CHANGE. OVER THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN, I WILL OFFER PLANS TO REIN IN EXCESSIVE RISKS ON WALL STREET AND ENSURE THAT STOCK MARKETS WORK FOR EVERYDAY INVESTORS, NOT JUST HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADERS AND THOSE WITH THE BEST OR FASTEST CONNECTIONS. I WILL APPOINT AND EMPOWER REGULATORS WHO UNDERSTAND THAT TOO BIG TO FAIL IS STILL TOO BIG A PROBLEM. WE WILL ENSURE --   WE WILL ENSURE THAT NO FIRM IS TOO COMPLEX TO MANN --OVERSEE. WE WILL ALSO PROCESS INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS FIRMS WHEN THEY COMMIT FRAUD FOR WRONGDOING.   WHEN THE GOVERNMENT RECOVERS MONEY FROM CORPORATIONS OR INDIVIDUALS FOR HARMING THE PUBLIC, IT SHOULD GO INTO A SEPARATE TRUST FUND TO BENEFIT THE PUBLIC. IT COULD, FOR EXAMPLE, HELP WATER KNIVES INFRASTRUCTURE OR EVEN BE RETURNED -- MODERNIZE INFRASTRUCTURE OR BE RETURNED TO HELP TAXPAYERS. WE HAVE DONE IT BEFORE IN OUR COUNTRY, AND WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME. YES, WE NEED LEADERSHIP FROM THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY AND ACROSS THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO JOIN WITH US. TWO YEARS AGO, TERRY DUFFY PUBLISHED AN OP-ED IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THAT REALLY CAUGHT MY ATTENTION. HE WROTE HE WAS CONCERNED THAT THOSE OF US IN FINANCIAL SERVICES IN HAVE FORGOTTEN WHO THEY SERVE IN THE PUBLIC KNOWS IT. SOME CAN SLIP INTO REGARDING THEIR WORK AS A KIND OF MONEYMAKING GAME, DIVORCED FROM CONCERNS OF THE MAIN STREET. I THINK WE SHOULD LISTEN TO TERRY DUFFY. OF COURSE, LONG-TERM GROWTH IS ONLY POSSIBLE IF THE PUBLIC-SECTOR STEPS UP AS WELL. IT IS TIME TO END THE ERA OF BUDGET BRINKMANSHIP AND STOP CAREENING FROM ONE SELF-INFLICTED CRISIS TO ANOTHER. IT IS TIME TO STOP HAVING DEBATES OVER THE SMALL STUFF AND FOCUS HOW WE ARE GOING TO TACKLE THE BIG STUFF TOGETHER. HOW DO WE RESPOND TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND A WAY THAT CREATES MORE GOOD JOBS THAN IT DISPLACES OR DESTROYS? CAN WE SUSTAIN ADVANCED MANUFACTURING? WHAT ARE THE BEST WAYS TO NURTURE STARTUPS OUTSIDE OF THE SUCCESSFUL CORRIDORS OF SILICON VALLEY? QUESTIONS LIKE THESE DEMAND THOUGHTFUL AND MATURE DEBATE. SOME POLICYMAKERS AND GOVERNMENT FROM OUR LEADERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, OUR ECONOMISTS, ACADEMICS, OTHERS WHO CAN COME TOGETHER AND ON BEHALF OF AMERICA PERFORM THEIR PATRIOTIC DUTY TO MAKE SURE OUR ECONOMY KEEPS WORKING AND OUR MIDDLE CLASS KEEPS GROWING.   THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO BE SMARTER, SIMPLER, MORE FOCUSED ON LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS THAN SHORT-TERM POLITICS. AND BE A BETTER PARTNER TO THE CITY, STATE, AND PRIVATE SECTOR. WASHINGTON HAS TO BE A BETTER STEWARD OF AMERICA'S TAX DOLLARS AND AMERICA'S TRUST. AND PLEASE, LET'S GET BACK TO MAKING DECISIONS THAT RELY ON EVIDENCE MORE THAN IDEOLOGY.   THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT, I WILL SEEK OUT AND WELCOME ANY GOOD IDEA THAT IS ACTUALLY BASED ON REALITY.   I WOULD HAVE PRINCIPLES AND PRAGMATIC AND REGRESSIVE POLICIES THAT REALLY MOVE US FORWARD TOGETHER, AND I WILL PROPOSE WAYS TO ENSURE THAT OUR FISCAL OUTLOOK IS SUSTAINABLE, INCLUDING BY CONTINUING TO RESTRAIN HEALTH CARE COSTS, WHICH REMAINED ONE OF THE KEY DRIVERS OF LONG-TERM DEFICIT. I WILL MAKE SURE WASHINGTON LEARNS FROM HOW WELL LOCAL GOVERNMENT, BUSINESSES, AND NONPROFITS ARE WORKING TOGETHER IN THE SUCCESSFUL CITIES AND TOWNS ACROSS AMERICA. PASSING LEGISLATION IS NOT THE ONLY WAY TO DRIVE PROGRESS. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL USE THE POWER TO CONVENE, CONNECT, AND COLLABORATE. TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS THAT ACTUALLY GET THINGS DONE. ABOVE ALL, WE HAVE TO BREAK OUT OF THE POISONOUS PARTISAN GRIDLOCK AND FOCUS ON THE LONG-TERM NEEDS OF OUR COUNTRY.   I CONFESS, MAYBE IT'S THE GRANDMOTHER IN ME BUT I BELIEVE THAT PART OF PUBLIC SERVICE IS PLANTING TREES UNDER WHOSE SHADE YOU WILL NEVER SET. THE VISION I HAVE LAID OUT FOR STRONG GROWTH, FAIR GROWTH, AND LONG-TERM GROWTH, ALL WORKING TOGETHER WILL GET INCOMES RISING AGAIN. IT WILL HELP WORKING FAMILIES GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. THAT IS THE TEST OF OUR TIME. I AM INVITING EVERYONE TO PLEASE JOIN ME TO DO YOUR PART. THAT IS WHAT GREAT COUNTRIES DO, THAT IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY ALWAYS HAS DONE. WE RISE TO CHALLENGES. IT'S NOT ABOUT LEFT, RIGHT, OR CENTER. IT IS ABOUT THE FUTURE. VERSUS THE PAST. I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO BUILD AN AMERICA FOR TOMORROW, NOT YESTERDAY. AN AMERICA BUILT ON GROWTH AND FAIRNESS, AN AMERICA WHERE IF YOU DO YOUR PART, YOU WILL REAP THE REWARD. WHERE WE DON'T LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND.  >>  THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH ONE MORE THOUGHT. I WANT EVERY CHILD, NOT JUST THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A FORMER PRESIDENT OR FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, BUT EVERY CHILD TO BE ABLE TO REACH FOR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. LET'S DO IT TOGETHER, THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.                 >>",Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton Economic Policy Address

THANK   WOW.  THANK  YOU SO  VERY MUCH.  I CANNOT  TELL YOU  HOW PERSONALLY HONORED I  AM  TO  BE  HERE  WITH ALL OF  YOU,  TO BE AT THIS  HISTORIC   INSTITUTION. LET  ME START  BY THANKING PRESIDENT  RUDLEY AND  EVERYONE  AT TEXAS SOUTHERN  UNIVERSITY. IT'S A  GREAT  TREAT  TO BE  HERE,   TO HAVE  HEARD JUST  BRIEFLY  FROM DR.  RUDLEY  AND OTHERS ABOUT  THE INCREDIBLE  PROGRAMS AND  PROGRESS AND  THE  FACT  THAT YOU GRADUATED  MORE THAN  1,000  YOUNG PEOPLE   INTO  THE WORLD  NOT  SO MANY  DAYS AGO. THIS INSTITUTION  IS THE  LIVING LEGACY, THE ABSOLUTE  EMBODYMENT OF  THE LONG  STRUGGLE FOR  CIVIL RIGHTS.  AND FOR  ME,  TO  BE SURROUNDED BY SO  MANY  HERE IN  HOUSTON, TEXAS,  AND  INDEED FROM  ACROSS OUR   COUNTRY,  WHO WERE  PART  OF THAT MOVEMENT  IS ESPECIALLY  TOUCHING. I  AM DELIGHTED TO  BE  HERE WITH MY  FRIEND, SHEILA JACKSON  LEE,   SHE  HAS   SHE'S  BEEN A  TIRELESS CHAMPION  FOR  THE  PEOPLE OF THE  18TH DISTRICT  AND  THE STATE  AND  THE COUNTRY. I  HAVE  TO  SAY, THOUGH,  I EXPECTED  HER  TO TELL YOU THE   MOST IMPORTANT  NEWS COMING  OUT   OF THE  CONGRESS,  AND THAT  IS,  SHE  IS FINALLY A  MEMBER  OF THE   GRANDMOTHERS' CLUB.    AND  A  MEMBER  OF NOW  A  LITTLE OVER  EIGHT  MONTHS,  IT IS  THE   BEST  CLUB  YOU'LL EVER  BE  A MEMBER  OF, SHEILA. I  ALSO  HAVE TO  CONFESS,  I  WAS EXCITED  ABOUT COMING  HERE  AND  TO TALK  ABOUT  AN  ISSUE  THAT WAS IMPORTANT  TO  BARBARA  JORDAN AND  SHOULD  BE  IMPORTANT TO  ALL OF  US,  BUT  TO DO  SO IN  FRONT  OF DR. FRIEDMAN IS  A  LITTLE DAUNTING. I  MEAN, ANYONE  WHO KNOWS  WHAT  THIS  MAN HAS  MEANT,  NOT JUST  TO BARBARA  JORDAN BUT  TO  SO MANY  WHO  HAVE STUDIED  HERE,  WHO HAVE  BEEN IN ANY WAY  AFFECTED  BY HIS BRILLIANT  TEACHING OF ELOCUTION  AND  DELIVERY WOULD  BE  A  LITTLE DAUNTED TOO. I  NOTICE THAT  BOTH DR.  RUDLEY AND SHEILA  GOT  OFF BEFORE  DR. FREEDMAN  CAME UP.  I  ALSO  WANT TO  SAY  MY  THOUGHTS AND  PRAYERS  ARE  WITH THE   FAMILIES IN  HOUSTON  AND  ACROSS TEXAS  WHO  HAVE BEEN  AFFECTED BY THE  RECENT  TERRIBLE FLOODING.  AND I  AM CONFIDENT  THAT THIS COMMUNITY  WILL  EMBRACE THEM. I  REMEMBER VERY  WELL COMING HERE AFTER KATRINA  WITH MY  HUSBAND AND  IN  FACT  WE  INVITED TO  COME ALONG  A  YOUNG SENATOR  FROM ILLINOIS  BY  THE  NAME  OF BARACK OBAMA. AND  WITH SHEILA  AND  OTHER LEADERS  IN  THE  COMMUNITY, WE TOURED THE FACILITIES  THAT HOUSTON HAD  PROVIDED TO  THOSE WHO  WERE  FLEING  THAT HORRIFIC  STORM. I  SAW  HOW  PEOPLE  OPENED THEIR  HEARTS  AND  THEIR HOMES. THIS  IS  A  CITY  THAT KNOWS  HOW  TO PULL TOGETHER  AND  I'M CONFIDENT  YOU WILL  DO  SO  AGAIN  ON BEHALF   OF  THOSE WHO  ARE  SUFFERING FROM  THIS  LATEST TERRIBLE DISASTER. AND  IT  IS ALSO A  SPECIAL  MOMENT TO BE HERE,  KNOWING THAT  BARBARA JORDAN WAS  SUCCEEDED BY  NIKI   LELAND  AND THE  18TH DISTRICT  WAS SO WELL  REPRESENTED  FOR SO  LONG  AND I'M  DELIGHTED  TO  BE HERE   WITH  ALLISON AND  TO  REMEMBER THE PIONEERING  WORK  HE  DID ON  BEHALF OF  CHILDREN AND  THE  POOR  AND HUNGER SO MANY  ISSUES  THAT  HE WAS  CHAMPION OF. I WANT  TO  THANK -- I  WANT TO THANK  ROSEMARY MCGOWAN  AND  ALL   THE FRIENDS  AND LOVED ONES  OF BARBARA  JORDAN  HERE TODAY.   THIS  IS SUCH  A PARTICULAR  HONOR  FOR ME  BECAUSE  THE AWARD  IS IN   MEMORY OF  ONE  OF MY  TRUE PERSONAL  HEROES. A  WOMAN  WHO  TAUGHT ME  AND  SO MANY  OTHERS THE  MEANING OF   COURAGE AND  DETERMINATION  IN THE PURSUIT  OF JUSTICE. I  FIRST MET  BARBARA  JORDAN WHEN  I  WAS  A YOUNG  ATTORNEY  AND  HAD BEEN  GIVEN A POSITION  WORKING  FOR THE  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,   INVESTIGATING RICHARD NIXON. AND  IT WAS  SUCH A  PROFOUND   MOMENT IN  AMERICAN HISTORY,  AND  THERE WASN'T  ANYONE WHO  WAS A MORE EFFECTIVE, ELOQUENT,  INQUISITOR THAN  BARBARA JORDAN.  AS A  26-YEAR-OLD FRESH  OUT  OF  LAW SCHOOL, AS  SOME  OF YOU  ARE   PERHAPS  NOW, HAVING GRADUATED  FROM THE  THURGOOD MARSHALL   SCHOOL HERE AT T.S.U.,  I  WAS RIVETED  AND  NOT A  LITTLE INTIMIDATED, TO  TELL  YOU  THE TRUTH,  BY THIS UNSTOPPABLE CONGRESSWOMAN  FROM TEXAS. I  GOT  TO  TALK  WITH  HER, WHICH WAS THRILLING. I  GOT  TO  HAND HER PAPERS, WHICH  WAS  EQUALLY EXCITING. BUT  MOSTLY  I GOT  TO  WATCH AND LISTEN  TO HER. AT  A  TIME OF SHAKEN CONFIDENCE,  SHE STIRRED THE  ENTIRE NATION WITH  HER WORDS. REMEMBER  WHAT SHE  SAID. MY FAITH  IN THE CONSTITUTION  IS WHOLE, IT  IS COMPLETE, IT  IS  THE TOTAL. IT  WAS  THAT PASSION  AND  MORAL CLARITY  THAT TOOK BARBARA  JORDAN FROM T.S.U.  AND  THE HALLS  OF THE TEXAS LEGISLATURE ALL  THE  WAY TO CONGRESS. THE FIRST  WOMAN,  THE  FIRST   AFRICAN-AMERICAN EVER  ELECTED TO REPRESENT  TEXAS  IN  THE  HOUSE  OF REPRESENTATIVES. AND SHE DEFENDED  AND  CONTINUED THE  CIVIL RIGHTS  LEGACY OF DR.   MARTIN  LUTHER KING  JR.  AND HER   FRIEND AND  MENTOR,  PRESIDENT   LYNDON JOHNSON. AND IN  PARTICULAR, SHE  WAS A   STAUNCH  ADVOCATE FOR  THE VOTING RIGHTS  ACT,  WHICH HAD  HELPED   MAKE IT  POSSIBLE  FOR  HER  TO BE ELECTED. IN 1975,  IN  THE  FACE OF FIERCE   OPPOSITION, BARBARA  JORDAN LED   THE  FIGHT TO  EXTEND THE  SPECIAL PROTECTION  OF  THE VOTING  RIGHTS  ACT  TO MANY MORE AMERICANS,  INCLUDING HISPANIC  AMERICANS, NATIVE  AMERICANS, AND  ASIAN AMERICANS  AS WELL. AND  LIKE EVERY  WOMAN  WHO HAS  RUN FOR  NATIONAL  OFFICE IN  THIS  COUNTRY IN  THE LAST FOUR DECADES,  I  STAND  HERE ON THE   SHOULDERS OF  BARBARA  JORDAN AND  SO  DOES OUR  ENTIRE COUNTRY. AND  BOY,  DO  WE  MISS HER. WE  MISS HER  COURAGE,  WE ALSO   MISS HER  HUMOR.  SHE WAS  FUNNY. I REMEMBER  TALKING TO  HER  AND ANN  RICHARDS ONE  TIME  AND  BETWEEN THE  TWO  OF THEM, FORGET TRYING  TO  GET  A  WORD  IN  AT ALL. AND  THEY  WERE  TELLING ME  ABOUT   HOW THEY  LOVED TO GO  TO  THE UNIVERSITY  OF  TEXAS WOMEN'S  BASKETBALL GAMES. AND  BARBARA WOULD  BE  THERE, BY   THAT TIME,  IN HER WHEELCHAIR  ON  THE SIDELINES,  ANN  WOULD  BE HOLDING  COURT  RIGHT  NEXT TO  HER AND  BARBARA  WOULD  BE  YELLING DIRECTIONS  LIKE SHE  WAS,  YOU   KNOW,  THE  COACH. WHY  ARE YOU  DOING THAT?  JUMP HIGHER! THAT'S NOT  A PASS! ALL  OF  THOSE KINDS  OF  SIDELINE COMMENTS. AND  SO  ANN WAS  TELLING ME THIS,  WITH  BARBARA RIGHT  THERE  AND  ANN SAID, I  FINALLY  TURNED  TO HER  AND  I  SAID, BARBARA,  ENCOURAGE THESE YOUNG  WOMEN. DON'T  JUST CRITICIZE THEM. AND  BAR RAH --  BARBARA  TURNED  AROUND AND  SAID, WHEN  THEY   DESERVE  IT,  I WILL.  WE  SURE  COULD USE  HER IRRESISTIBLE  VOICE.  I WISH  WE  COULD  HEAR THAT  VOICE  ONE MORE TIME, HEAR  HER  EXPRESS THE  OUTRAGE  WE  FEEL  ABOUT THE  FACT THAT  40 YEARS AFTER  BARBARA JORDAN  FOUGHT  TO  EXTEND THE VOTING  RIGHTS ACT,  ITS  HEART  HAS BEEN  RIPPED OUT. AND  I WISH  WE  COULD HEAR  HER SPEAK  UP  FOR  THE STUDENT  WHO  HAS TO  WAIT HOURS FOR HIS  OR  HER   RIGHT  TO VOTE. FOR  THE GRANDMOTHER  WHOSE  TURN    -- WHO  IS  TURNED  AWAY  FROM THE POLLS  BECAUSE HER  DRIVER'S   LICENSE EXPIRED. FOR THE  FATHER  WHO  HAS  DONE  HIS  TIME AND PAID  HIS  DEBT TO  SOCIETY BUT  STILL  HASN'T GOTTEN  HIS  RIGHT BACK.  NOW WE KNOW,  UNFORTUNATELY, BARBARA  ISN'T  HERE  TO SPEAK  UP   FOR  THEM AND  SO MANY  OTHERS. BUT WE ARE.  AND  WE HAVE A  RESPONSIBILITY TO  SAY CLEARLY  AND DIRECTLY  WHAT'S  REALLY GOING  ON  IN  OUR COUNTRY.  BECAUSE WHAT IS  HAPPENING  IS A   SWEEPING EFFORT TO DISEMPOWER AND  DISENFRANCHISE PEOPLE  OF COLOR, POOR PEOPLE,  AND  YOUNG PEOPLE  FROM  ONE  END  OF OUR   COUNTRY TO  THE OTHER. BECAUSE SINCE  THE  SUPREME COURT  EVISCERATED A KEY  PROVISION OF   THE VOTING  RIGHTS ACT IN  2013,   MANY OF  THE STATES THAT PREVIOUSLY  FACED SPECIAL   SCRUTINY  BECAUSE OF  A  HISTORY OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION HAVE   PROPOSED AND  PASSED NEW  LAWS   THAT  MAKE  IT HARDER  THAN EVER  TO VOTE. NORTH  CAROLINA  PASSED  A BILL   THAT WENT  AFTER PRETTY  MUCH  ANYTHING  THAT MAKES  VOTING  MORE CONVENIENT  OR  MORE ACCESSIBLE. EARLY VOTING. SAME-TAI REGISTRATION.  -- SAME-DAY REGISTRATION.  THE  ABILITY  OF COUNTY ELECTION   OFFICIALS  TO  EVEN EXTEND  VOTING HOURS  TO ACCOMMODATE  LONG LINES. WHAT POSSIBLE REASON COULD  THERE BE  TO END PREREGISTRATION  FOR 16 AND 17-YEAR-OLDS  AND ELIMINATE VOTER OUTREACH IN  HIGH SCHOOL? WE  SHOULD  BE  DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN  TO  GET OUR YOUNG  PEOPLE MORE ENGAGED IN DEMOCRACY,  NOT LESS. IN  FACT,  I SAY  IT  IS A CRUEL   IRONY  BUT NO COINCIDENCE THAT MILLENIALS,  THE MOST DIVERSE,  TOLERANT,  AND INCLUSIVE  GENERATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY,  ARE NOW FACING  SO  MUCH EXCLUSION. AND  WE NEED  LOOK  NO FURTHER  THAN RIGHT HERE  IN TEXAS. YOU  ALL KNOW  THIS  FAR  BETTER THAN  I,  BUT  IF  YOU  WANT TO  VOTE  IN THIS  STATE,  YOU  CAN USE  A CONCEALED  WEAPONS PERMIT  AS  A VALID FORM  OF IDENTIFICATION  BUT A  VALID STUDENT  I.D.  ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH. CRYSTAL  WATSON FOUND  OUT  THE HARD  WAY.  SHE  GREW  UP  IN LOUISIANA  BUT CAME  TO  MARSHALL, TEXAS,  ATTEND WILIE COLLEGE. AND -- WILIE COLLEGE. AND  CRYSTAL  TAKES  HER RESPONSIBILITIES  AS  A  CITIZEN TO SERIOUSLY  THAT  NOT  ONLY DID  SHE REGISTER  TO  VOTE  IN  TEXAS WHERE SHE  WAS  LIVING  AND  WOULD  BE  FOR A  NUMBER  OF  YEARS, SHE  EVEN BECAME  A  DEPUTY  REGISTRAR TO HELP  OTHER  PEOPLE  VOTE  AS WELL. BUT,  THIS PAST YEAR,  WHEN SHE  SHOWED  UP  AT  HER LOCAL POLLING   PLACE WITH A  WYLIE COLLEGE I.D., SHE  WAS  TURNED AWAY. EXPERTS ESTIMATE THAT  HUNDREDS   OF THOUSANDS  OF REGISTERED VOTERS  IN TEXAS MAY WELL FACE  SIMILAR SITUATIONS. AND  WHILE HIGH  PROFILE STATE   LAWS  LIKE THOSE  IN TEXAS AND   NORTH  CAROLINA  GET  MOST OF  THE ATTENTION, MANY  OF THE  WORST   OFFENSES AGAINST THE  RIGHT  TO  VOTE ACTUALLY HAPPEN  BELOW THE RADAR. LIKE WHEN  AUTHORITIES  SHIFT POLL LOCATIONS AND ELECTION  DATES,  OR SCRAP LANGUAGE  ASSISTANCE FOR NONENGLISH SPEAKING  CITIZENS. SOMETHING  BARBARA  JORDAN FOUGHT  SO  HARD  TO PROVIDE. WITHOUT THE  PRECLEARANCE   PROVISION OF  THE VOTING RIGHTS   ACT,  NO ONE OUTSIDE  THE LOCAL  COMMUNITY IS LIKELY  EVER  TO  HEAR ABOUT THESE ABUSES. LET  ALONE HAVE  A CHANCE  TO   CHALLENGE THEM  AND  END THEM. NOW,  IT'S NOT  A  SURPRISE FOR  YOU TO HEAR THAT  STUDIES AND EVERYDAY  EXPERIENCES  CONFIRM THAT MINORITY  VOTERS ARE  MORE  LIKELY  THAN WHITE  VOTERS  TO  WAIT IN  LONG LINES  AT  POLLING PLACES. THEY ARE  ALSO  FAR  MORE LIKELY  TO VOTE IN  POLLING PLACES  WITH  INSUFFICIENT NUMBERS  OF VOTING   MACHINES. IN  SOUTH CAROLINA,  FOR EXAMPLE, THERE'S  SUPPOSED  TO ONE --  TO BE ONE  MACHINE  FOR  EVER 150  VOTERS  BUT IN  MINORITY AREAS,  THAT RULE IS  JUST OFTEN  OVERLOOKED. IN  RICHLAND COUNTY,  NEARLY 90  NOVEGET PRECINCTS  FAILED TO  MEET THE STANDARD  REQUIRED BY LAW  IN 2012.  INSTEAD OF  250 VOTERS  PER MACHINE  IN  WIN PRECINCT,  IT WAS  MORE THAN  430 VOTERS  PER MACHINE. NOT SURPRISINGLY,  PEOPLE TRYING  TO  CAST  A  BALLOT THERE  FACE  MASSIVE DELAYS. THERE  ARE MANY  FAIR-MINDED, WELL-INTENTIONED ELECTION  OFFICIALS  ALL  OVER OUR  COUNTRY   BUT THIS  KIND OF  DISPARITY I   JUST  MENTIONED DOES  NOT  HAPPEN   BY ACCIDENT. NOW  SOME  OF  YOU MAY  HAVE  HEARD ME OR  MY  HUSBAND SAY  ONE  OF  OUR FAVORITE SAYINGS  FROM  ARKANSAS.  OF  COURSE I  LEARNED  IT  FROM HIM. IF  YOU  FIND  A TURTLE  ON  A FENCE POST,  IT  DID  NOT GET  THERE  ON  ITS OWN.   WELL, ALL  OF  THESE  PROBLEMS WITH VOTING  JUST DIDN'T  HAPPEN  BY ACCIDENT. AND  IT IS  JUST WRONG.  IT'S  WRONG TO  TRY TO PREVENT,  UNDERMINE, INHIBIT  AMERICANS'  RIGHT  TO VOTE. IT'S  COUNTER  TO THE  VALUES  WE  SHARE  AND  IN A  TIME  WHEN  SO MANY AMERICANS  HAVE  LOST TRUST IN  OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM,  IT'S THE   OPPOSITE  OF WHAT  WE  SHOULD  BE  DOING IN  OUR COUNTRY.  THIS  IS  THE GREATEST,  LONGEST LASTING  DEMOCRACY  IN THE  HISTORY OF  THE WORLD.  WE  SHOULD BE  CLEARING  THE  WAY FOR  MORE  PEOPLE TO  VOTE, NOT   PUTTING  UP EVERY  ROADBLOCK   ANYONE  CAN IMAGINE. YET,  UNFORTUNATELY, TODAY  THERE  ARE PEOPLE WHO  OFFER THEMSELVES  TO  BE LEADERS,  WHOSE  ACTIONS HAVE  UNDERCUT THIS  FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN PRINCIPLE.  HERE  IN TEXAS,  FORMER GOVERNOR   RICK  PERRY SIGNED  A  LAW  THAT A FEDERAL  COURT SAID WAS  ACTUALLY WRITTEN  WITH  THE PURPOSE OF  DISCRIMINATING AGAINST  MINORITY VOTERS. HE  APPLAUDED  WHEN THE  VOTING   RIGHTS ACT  WAS GUTTED. AND  SAID THE  LOSS -- THE LAW'S PROTECTIONS  WERE  OUTDATED AND  UNNECESSARY. BUT GOVERNOR  PERRY  IS HARDLY   ALONE IN  HIS  CRUSADE AGAINST   VOTING  RIGHTS. IN WISCONSIN, GOVERNOR  SCOTT WALKER  CUT  BACK  EARLY  VOTING AND SIGNED  LEGISLATION THAT  WOULD  MAKE  IT  HARDER FOR COLLEGE   STUDENTS TO  VOTE. IN  NEW JERSEY,  GOVERNOR CHRIS  ISAAK  TEE VETOED LEGISLATION -- CHRIS CHRISTIE  VETOED LEGISLATION  TO EXTEND VOTING.  AND IN  ANOTHER  STATE THEY  PURGED ROLLS  OF  VOTERS  BEFORE THE   PRESIDENTIAL  ELECTION IN 2000. THANKFULLY  IN  2004,  A  PLAN TO  PURGE  EVEN MORE  VOTERS WAS HEADED  OFF. SO TODAY  REPUBLICANS ARE SYSTEMATICALLY  AND DELIBERATELY TRYING  TO STOP  MILLIONS OF AMERICAN  CITIZENS  FROM VOTING. WHAT PART OF  DEMOCRACY  ARE THEY AFRAID  OF? I  BELIEVE EVERY  CITIZEN  HAS THE  RIGHT  TO  VOTE AND  I  BELIEVE WE   SHOULD  DO EVERYTHING  WE  CAN TO   MAKE IT  EASIER FOR  EVERY CITIZEN TO VOTE.   I  CALL ON  REPUBLICANS  AT ALL   LEVELS  OF  GOVERNMENT, WITH  ALL   MANNER OF  AMBITION, TO  STOP  FEAR MONGERING  ABOUT A PHANTOM  EPIDEMIC OF  ELECTION  FRAUD AND START EXPLAINING  WHY  THEY'RE SO  SCARED  OF LETTING  CITIZENS HAVE  THEIR SAY. NOW,  YES,  THIS IS ABOUT  DEMOCRACY,  BUT IT'S  ALSO ABOUT   DIGNITY. ABOUT  THE  ABILITY  TO  STAND  UP AND  SAY, YES,  I AM  A CITIZEN.  I  AM AN  AMERICAN.  MY VOICE COUNTS. AND NO  MATTER  WHERE  YOU COME   FROM  OR  WHAT YOU  LOOK  LIKE OR  HOW  MUCH  MONEY  YOU HAVE,  THAT MEANS  SOMETHING. IN  FACT, IT  MEANS  A LOT. I  LEARNED THOSE  LESSONS  RIGHT HERE IN TEXAS. REGISTERING VOTERS  IN SOUTH  TEXAS, DOWN  IN THE VALLEY,  IN 1972.  SOME  OF  THE PEOPLE  I MET  WERE UNDERSTANDABLY A  LITTLE WARY  OF  A  GIRL FROM  CHICAGO  WHO DIDN'T   SPEAK  A WORD  OF SPANISH. BUT THEY  WANTED  TO VOTE. THEY WERE  CITIZENS. THEY  KNEW  THEY  HAD A  RIGHT  TO  BE HEARD. THEY  WANTED  TO  EXERCISE ALL  THE  RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES THAT CITIZENSHIP CONVEYS. THAT'S WHAT  SHOULD  MATTER. BECAUSE  WHEN THOSE  RIGHTS ARE  DENIES TO  ANYONE,  WE'RE ALL  THE  WORSE  FOR IT. IT  DOESN'T  JUST HOLD  BACK THE ASPIRATIONS  OF  INDIVIDUAL  CITIZEN, IT  HOLDS  BACK  OUR ENTIRE  COUNTRY. THAT'S  WHY  AS  A SENATOR  I CHAMPIONED  A  BILL  CALLED THE   COUNT EVERY  VOTE ACT.  IF IT  HAD  BECOME  LAW, IT  WOULD HAVE  MADE  ELECTION  DAY A  FEDERAL HOLIDAY  AND  MANDATED EARLY VOTING OPPORTUNITIES.    DECEIVING VOTERS,  INCLUDING BY SENDING FLYERS  INTO  MINORITY NEIGHBORHOODS  WITH  FALSE VOTING  TIMES  AND  PLACES WOULD  HAVE BECOME  A  FEDERAL CRIME.  AND  MANY AMERICANS WITH  CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS  WHO  HAD  PAID THEIR DEBTS  TO  SOCIETY  WOULD  HAVE FINALLY  GOTTEN THEIR  VOTING  RIGHTS BACK. WELL,  TODAY,  WITH  THE DAMAGE  THE VOTING RIGHTS  ACT  SO SEVERE,  THE NEED  FOR ACTION  IS  EVEN MORE URGENT. FIRST, CONGRESS  SHOULD  MOVE QUICKLY  TO  PASS LEGISLATION  TO REPAIR  THAT  DAMAGE AND  RESTORE THE  FULL PROTECTIONS  THAT AMERICAN  VOTERS NEED  AND DE SERVE. I  WAS SERVING  IN  THE  SENATE IN 2006.  WE VOTED 98-0 TO  RE-AUTHORIZE  THE VOTING  RIGHTS ACT. AFTER AN EXHAUSTIVE REVIEW   PROCESS. THERE  HAD  BEEN  MORE THAN 20  HEARINGS  IN  BOTH THE  HOUSE AND   SENATE  JUDICIARY COMMITTEES. THERE  HAD  BEEN  TESTIMONY FROM  SO MANY EXPERT WITNESSES, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS  DOCUMENTING CONTINUING   DISCRIMINATION IN  COVERED JURISDICTIONS. THERE WAS  MORE THAN  15,000 PAGES OF  LEGISLATIVE RECORD. NOW  THAT  IS HOW  THE  SYSTEM  IS  SUPPOSED TO  WORK. YOU  GATHER THE  EVIDENCE. YOU  WEIGH  IT. AND  YOU  DECIDE  AND  WE DID. 98-0.  WE PUT  PRINCIPLE  AHEAD OF POLITICS.  THAT'S WHAT  CONGRESS  NEEDS TO  DO AGAIN. SECOND, WE  SHOULD  IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF  THE   BIPARTISAN PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION  TO IMPROVE  VOTING. THAT  COMMISSION  WAS CHAIRED  BY PRESIDENT OBAMA'S  CAMPAIGN LAWYER  AND  BY GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY'S  CAMPAIGN LAWYER  AND THEY  ACTUALLY  AGREED. AND  THEY  SET FORTH COMMONSENSE REFORM INCLUDING EXPANDING EARLY,  ABSENTEE, AND  MAIL  VOTING PRORKVIDING ONLINE  VOTER REGISTRATION. ESTABLISHING  THE  PRINCIPLE THAT  NO ONE  SHOULD  EVER  HAVE  TO  WAIT MORE  THAN 30  MINUTES TO  CAST   YOUR VOTE. THIRD,  WE  SHOULD SET  A  STANDARD ACROSS  OUR  COUNTRY OF  AT  LEAST 20  DAYS OF EARLY, IN-PERSON  VOTING, EVERYWHERE, INCLUDING OPPORTUNITIES  FOR  WEEKEND AND EVENING VOTING.  WITH FAMILIES  COMING  OUT OF  CHURCH  ON  SUNDAY ARE INSPIRED  TO  --  IF FAMILIES  COMING  OUT OF   CHURCH  ON  SUNDAY ARE INSPIRED  TO GO  VOTE, THEY SHOULD  BE  FREE  TO  DO  JUST THAT.  AND  WE KNOW THAT  EARLY, IN-PERSON  VOTING WILL  REDUCE   THOSE  LONG LINES  AND GIVE  MORE   CITIZENS  THE  CHANCE TO   PARTICIPATE,  ESPECIALLY THOSE  WHO  HAVE  WORK  OR FAMILY  OBLIGATIONS  THAT  MAKE IT   DIFFICULT  TO  GET  TO THE  POLLS  ON ELECTION DAY.  IT'S  NOT  JUST CONVENIENT,  IT'S   ALSO MORE  SECURE, MORE  RELIABLE, AND MORE AFFORDABLE  THAN ABSENTEE  VOTING. SO LET'S  GET THIS  DONE.  AND  I BELIEVE  WE  SHOULD  GO EVEN  FURTHER  TO STRENGTHEN  VOTING   RIGHTS IN AMERICA. TODAY I'M CALLING FOR  UNIVERSAL, AUTOMATIC  VOTER REGISTRATION,  EVERY CITIZEN  IN EVERY  STATE  IN  THE UNION.   EVERYONE.  EVERY  YOUNG MAN  OR  YOUNG WOMAN   SHOULD  BE AUTOMATICALLY  REGISTERED TO  VOTE  WHEN  THEY   TURN 18. UNLESS  THEY ACTIVELY  HOOZE  TO OPT  OUT. I  THINK  THIS WOULD  HAVE  A  PROFOUND IMPACT  ON OUR  ELECTIONS AND  OUR DEMOCRACY. BETWEEN  A  QUARTER  AND  A  THIRD OF ALL ELIGIBLE  AMERICANS REMAIN UNREGISTERED  AND  THEREFORE UNABLE  TO  VOTE. AND  WE SHOULD  MODERNIZE OUR  ENTIRE  APPROACH TO REGISTRATION. THE  SYSTEM  WE  HAVE IS  A  RELIC FROM  AN  EARLIER AGE THAT  RELIES ON  A  BLIZZARD OF  PAPER  RECORDS. IT'S  FULL  OF ERRORS. IN  FACT,  WE CAN  DO  BETTER BY MAKING  SURE REGISTRATION  ROLLS ARE  SECURE,  UP  TO DATE,  AND COMPLETE,  SO  WHEN  YOU  MOVE, YOUR REGISTRATION  SHOULD  MOVE WITH YOU. IF YOU'RE AN ELIGIBLE VOTER AND  WANT  TO  BE REGISTERED,  YOU   SHOULD  BE REGISTERED.  OREGON  IS  LEADING THE WAY,   MODERNIZING  ITS SYSTEM  AND  THE   REST  OF  THE COUNTRY  SHOULD   FOLLOW. THE  TECHNOLOGY  IS HERE.  STATES  HAVE  ALREADY A LOT  OF  THE DATA THAT'S  NEEDED.  IT'S  JUST A  MATTER OF  SYNCING AND  STREAMLINING.  ALL  THESE REFORMS  FROM EXPANDED  EARLY  VOTING  TO MODERNIZED   REGISTRATION  ARE COMMONSENSE   WAYS  TO  STRENGTHEN OUR DEMOCRACY. BUT  I'LL  BE CANDID HERE. NONE  OF  THEM  WILL COME EASILY. IT'S  GOING TO TAKE  LEADERSHIP AT MANY  LEVELS. NOW  MORE THAN  EVER,  WE  NEED OUR  CITIZENS  TO ACTUALLY  GET  OUT AND VOTE  FOR  PEOPLE WHO  WANT  TO HEAR WHAT'S  ON THEIR MINDS. WE NEED  MORE ACTIVISTS  WORKING   TO EXPOSE  ABUSES,  EDUCATE AMERICANS  ABOUT THEIR  RIGHTS,  AND HOLD  AUTHORITIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR  PROTECTING THEM. SOME  OF THE WORST  PROVISIONS  IN RECENT  LAWS  HAVE  BEEN  BLOCKED OR DELAYED BY TIRELESS  ADVOCATES  RAISING THE  ALARM  AND FILING   LEGAL  CHALLENGES BUT  THEY  CAN'T  DO  IT ALONE. WE NEED MORE  GRASSROOTS MOBILIZATION  EFFORTS LIKE  THE  MORAL MONDAY  MOVEMENT IN  NORTH   CAROLINA.  TO BUILD  MOMENTUM  FOR REFORM.  WE  NEED MORE JUSTICES  ON  THE SUPREME  COURT  WHO WILL  PROTECT EVERY  CITIZEN'S RIGHT  TO VOTE.   I  MEAN,  THE PRINCIPLE  UNDERLYING OUR  CONSTITUTION,  WHICH WE  HAD   TO FIGHT  FOR  A  LONG TIME  TO MAKE APPLY TO  EVERYBODY, ONE  AMERICAN, ONE  VOTE. AND  WE NEED  A  SUPREME COURT  THAT CARES MORE  ABOUT  PROTECTING THE  RIGHT  TO  VOTE OF  A  PERSON  THAN   THE RIGHT  TO  BUY  AN ELECTION  OF  A CORPORATION.   BUT  OF  COURSE, YOU  KNOW  WHAT WE  REALLY  NEED? WE  NEED  MORE  ELECTED LEADERS, FROM  HOUSTON  TO AUSTIN TO  WASHINGTON,  WHO  WILL FOLLOW  IN   THE  FOOTSTEPS OF  BARBARA JORDAN  AND  WHO  WILL FIGHT  EVERY DAY  FOR THE  RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES  OF  EVERYDAY AMERICANS,  NOT  JUST THOSE  AT  THE  TOP  OF THE LADDER,  AND  WE  NEED  TO REMEMBER THAT   PROGRESS IS  BUILT  ON  COMMON GROUND,  NOT SCORCHED  EARTH. WHEN I  TRAVELED  AROUND  AS YOUR   SECRETARY OF  STATE,  ONE OF  THE   MOST FREQUENT  QUESTIONS I  WAS ASKED WAS  HOW  COULD  YOU  AND PRESIDENT OBAMA  WORK  TOGETHER AFTER  YOU  FOUGHT  SO HARD  IN THAT CAMPAIGN? PEOPLE WERE GENUINELY AMAZED.  WHICH  I  SUPPOSE IS UNDERSTANDABLE CONSIDERING  THAT  IN  MANY  PLACES, WHEN  YOU  LOSE  AN ELECTION  OR  YOU OPPOSE  SOMEBODY  WHO  WINS  YOU COULD  GET   IMPRISONED,  EXILED OR  EVEN   KILLED,  NOT  ASKED  TO  BE SECRETARY  OF  STATE. AND IT'S  TRUE,  I WAS  SURPRISED   WHEN  THE  PRESIDENT ASKED  ME  TO SERVE. BUT  HE  MADE  THAT OFFER  AND I   ACCEPTED  IT FOR THE  SAME  REASON WE  BOTH --  FOR  THE SAME  REASON,  WE  BOTH  LOVE OUR COUNTRY!  SO, MY  FRIENDS,  HERE AT  THIS HISTORIC  INSTITUTION,  JUST LET   US  REMEMBER, AMERICA WAS  BUILT   BY  PEOPLE WHO KNEW  THAT  OUR  COMMON INTEREST  WAS MORE   IMPORTANT  THAN OUR SELF-INTEREST. THEY WERE  FEARLESS IN  PURSUIT OF A STRONGER, FREER,  FAIRER NATION.  AS  BARBARA JORDAN FAMOUSLY   REMINDED US,  WHEN  THE CONSTITUTION  WAS FIRST  WRITTEN,  IT  LEFT MOST  OF  US  HERE OUT. BUT GENERATIONS  OF AMERICANS   FOUGHT AND  MARCHED AND  ORGANIZED AND PRAYED  TO EXPAND  THE   CIRCUMSTANCELE OF  FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY. THEY  NEVER  GAVE  UP AND  THEY  NEVER  BACKED  DOWN. AND  NEARLY  A CENTURY AGO  ON  THIS VERY  DAY, AFTER  YEARS  OF STRUGGLE,  CONGRESS FINALLY   PASSED  THE 19TH  AMENDMENT  TO GIVE  WOMEN  THE RIGHT  TO VOTE  IN  THE UNITED STATES. SO THAT  IS  THE STORY  OF PROGRESS,  COURAGEOUS  MEN AND   WOMEN, EXPANDING  RIGHTS, NOT RESTRICTING THEM,  AND TODAY WE REFUSE,  WE REFUSE  TO ALLOW  OUR COUNTRY  AND  THIS GENERATION  OF LEADERS  TO SLOW  OR REVERSE AMERICA'S  LONG  MARCH  TOWARD A  MORE PERFECT  UNION.  WE  OWE IT  TO  OUR  CHILDREN  AND OUR  GRANDCHILDREN TO  FIGHT  JUST AS  HARD  AS THOSE  WHO  CAME BEFORE US,  TO  MARCH JUST  AS FAR, ORGANIZE  JUST  AS  WELL, TO  SPEAK  OUT  JUST AS  LOUDLY, AND  TO  VOTE EVERY CHANCE  WE  GET  FOR  THE  KIND OF FUTURE  WE  WANT. THAT'S  WHAT  BARBARA JORDAN  WOULD DO. THAT'S  WHAT  WE  SHOULD DO  IN  HONOR  OF HER. THANK  YOU  AND  MAY  GOD BLESS YOU.  ",Hillary Clinton on Voting Rights

AND YOU'RE ALSO NOT GOING TO SEE ME SHRINK FROM A FIGHT. I THINK BY NOW PEOPLE KNOW I DON'T QUIT. SO I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN ME. I HOPE YOU WILL HELP ME BUILD THIS CAMPAIGN, MAKE IT YOUR OWN, TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM. SIGN UP TO VOLUNTEER. THIS ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT ME. IT IS ABOUT US, AND IT HAS TO BE ABOUT WHAT WE DO TOGETHER TO RESTORETH A AND CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM IN THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY WE LOVE. I WANT TO END WITH A STORY. SOME OF YOU MIGHT REMEMBER WE HAD A PRETTY VIGOROUS CAMPAIGN IN 2008. AND BOTH PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WORKED REALLY HARD, AND HE WON, AND I LOST, AND THEN I WENT TO WORK TO MAKE SURE HE WOULD WIN, AND I WAS SO RELIEVED, I WAS JUST SO RELIEVED WHEN, FINALLY, NOVEMBER 2008 CAME AROUND, AND HE DID. AND THAT A FEW DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION, MY HUSBAND OR -- AND I WERE TAKING A WALK NEAR WHERE WE LIVE, AND HIS PHONE WENT OFF, AND HE ANSWERED IT, IT WAS THE PRESIDENT-ELECT, AND HE SAID, BILL, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU, AND I WANT TO TALK TO HILLARY, AND HE SAID, WELL, WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST, BUT AS SOON AS WE GET HOME, AND HE DID. HE TALKED ABOUT POSITIONS IN THE CABINET AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS HE WAS ALL OF A SUDDEN BEING CONFRONTED WITH THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN TOLD ABOUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY WERE, SO BILL TALKED TO HIM, AND HE THEN HANDED ME THE PHONE, AND HE SAID, I WHAT YOU DO COME TO CHICAGO TO MEET WITH ME, AND I SAID, CERTAINLY, WHEN? HE SAID AS SOON AS YOU CAN, AND I THOUGHT HE WOULD WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT I COULD DO IN THE SENATE TO SUPPORT WHAT HE WOULD BE CHAMPIONING AS PRESIDENT, SO I WENT A FEW DAYS LATER, GO INTO THIS BIG OFFICE BUILDING, AND I SIT DOWN WITH THE PRESIDENT-ELECT, AND HE SAYS TO ME, I WANT YOU TO BE MY SECRETARY OF STATE. I SAID, WELL, MR. PRESIDENT-ELECT, I AM FLATTERED. I AM HONORED, AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE, AND I GAVE HIM NAMES OF PEOPLE I THOUGHT WOULD BE GREAT SECRETARIES OF STATE, AND HE SAID, NO. I HAVE SPENT ALL OF MY TIME DEALING WITH THE ECONOMY. IT IS WORSE THAT WE WERE EVER TOLD, AND YET WE HAVE ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS AROUND THE WORLD, AND I NEED SOMEBODY I CAN SEND OUT THERE TO GO OUT THERE AND TALK TO ANYBODY, AND I WANT IT TO BE YOU. I SAID, WELL, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MOVED I AM, BUT I NEED TO GO BACK TO THE SENATE. HE SAID, I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU UNTIL YOU SAY YES.  AS IS CLINTON: SO I GO BACK TO THE AIRPORT, GET ON THE PLANE, GO BACK TO NEW YORK, AND I AM THINKING, THE RIGHT THING FOR ME IS TO STAY IN THE SENATE. THE PEOPLE IN NEW YORK AT A ROUGH TIME. I BECAME A SENATOR, AND EIGHT MONTHS LATER, WE HAD NINE/11, AND I SPENT PEOPLE TRYING TO REBUILD OUR CITY AND PROTECTED, AND I THOUGHT, I NEED TO GO BACK, SO I CALLED THE PRESIDENT-ELECT, AND I SAID, AGAIN, I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW HONORED I AM. I WILL SUPPORT YOU IN ANY WAY I CAN, BUT I NEED TO GO BACK TO THE SENATE, SO I MUST SAY NO, MR. PRESIDENT, AND HE SAID, I TOLD YOU, I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO SAY YES, AND I SAID TO MY HUSBAND, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? THE PRESIDENT-ELECT HAS ASKED ME TO BE PRESIDENT -- TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE, AND I TOLD HIM NO TWICE, AND HE SAID HE IS NOT GOING TO GIVE UP UNTIL I SAY YES, AND HE SAID, WELL, IF I REMEMBER, I ASKED YOU TO MARRY ME TWICE BEFORE YOU SAID YES.   YOU MIGHT STOP AND THINK. THERE IS A PATTERN HERE. SO I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT, AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, SUPPOSE IT HAD BEEN THE REVERSE, AND I HAD BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WIN, AND I WANTED SOME BUT HE TO BE ON MY CABINET THAT I KNEW I COULD RELY ON, AND I HAD ASKED THE PRESIDENT-ELECT. I WOULD HAVE WANTED HIM TO SAY YES, BECAUSE THE COUNTRY WAS FACING SOME VERY SERIOUS DECISIONS, SO I CALLED HIM BACK THE NEXT DAY, AND I SAID, OK, MR. PRESIDENT, I AM HONORED. I WILL BE YOUR SECRETARY OF STATE. AND FROM THAT MOMENT ON, WE BEGAN TO TALK AND TO WORK TOGETHER. FAST FORWARD, MY FIRST TRIP, I GO TO ASIA IN FEBRUARY 2009, AND I GO BECAUSE I STARTED CALLING PRESIDENTS, PRIME MINISTERS, FOREIGN MINISTERS, THEY ALL SAID, WE DID NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT, BECAUSE NOBODY HAS BEEN PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO US, AND I SAID, WELL, THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE. THE PRESIDENT AND I SEE ASIANA A VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITY, AND I AM GOING TO COME, SO I WAS ON MY WAY, AND ONE OF THE COUNTRIES I WAS GOING TO GO TO WAS INDONESIA, AND I AGREED TO DO BOTH THE PRIVATE MEETINGS WITH THE LEADERS AND THE PRESS CONFERENCES, THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU SEE ON TV, AND TO DO A LOT OF WHAT IS CALLED PUBLIC DIPLOMACY, WHERE WE WOULD REACH OUT TO PEOPLE, AND WE WOULD BASICALLY SAY, WE CARE ABOUT YOU. WE ARE BACK. WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU. LET'S TRY TO FIND WAYS WHERE WE CAN BE PARTNERS, AND SEND A DIFFERENT MESSAGE, SO I AGREED TO GO ON A SHOW IN JAKARTA CALLED ""THE AWESOME SHOW,"" AND IT WAS AN EARLY MORNING SHOW, AND IT WAS UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU SEE ON OUR TV, AND YOU SEE EVERYTHING ON OUR TV THESE DAYS, AND PEOPLE ARE JUMPING UP AND DOWN AND SINGING, AND I AM THINKING, HOPEFULLY THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ASK ME TO SING AND DANCE, BUT LUCKILY THEY DID NOT. THEY DIDN'T INTERVIEW, AND THEN THEY SAID TO THE AUDIENCE, DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, AND THEY CALLED ON THIS PERSON WHO SAID, I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. WE FOLLOWED YOUR ELECTION. I FOUND THAT THE PEOPLE OVERSEAS FOLLOWED OUR ELECTIONS IN MANY WAYS CLOSER THAN SOME OF US, AND SHE SAID, WE FOLLOWED YOUR ELECTION. IT WAS REALLY A HARD-FOUGHT, LONG ELECTION, BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, OUR ELECTIONS LAST FOREVER, COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE ELECTIONS, AND YOU WERE SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT HIM, AND HE WAS SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT YOU, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU END UP AS HIS SECRETARY OF STATE, AND HOW DOES THIS WORK, AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A REALLY SERIOUS QUESTION, BECAUSE IN A LOT OF PLACES, YOU WANT AGAINST SOMEBODY AND YOU LOSE, YOUR EXILED OR KILLED, NOT APPOINTED SECRETARY OF STATE, SO I THOUGHT THERE WAS A MOMENT WHERE IF I COULD READ MY BRAIN UP, I COULD THEY SOMETHING THAT COULD REALLY REACHING YOUNG PEOPLE, BECAUSE IT IS A NATION OF A PARTICULAR YOUNG DEMOCRACY, SO I SAID, YOU ARE RIGHT. WE RAN A VERY HARD CAMPAIGN AGAINST EACH OTHER. HE WON, I LOST, AND THEN I WENT TO WORK OR HIM BECAUSE HE AND I SHARED MANY OF THE SAME POSITIONS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IN THE NEXT PRESIDENCY, AND THEN HE WON, AND HE ASKED ME TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE, AND I SAID YES FOR THE SAME REASON, WE BOTH LOVE OUR COUNTRY, AND --    NO MATTER HOW HARD THIS ELECTION OR ANY ELECTION BECOMES, WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT AT THE CORE, WE CAN HAVE DISAGREEMENTS, AND WE WILL. WE HAVE DIFFERENT GOVERNING PHILOSOPHIES. WE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ABOUT WHAT WORKS AND WHAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS ABOUT WHAT WORKS FOR THE POLICIES. THAT IS ALL FAIR GAME, BUT WE SHOULD SHOW MORE RESPECT TOWARDS EACH OTHER, AND WE SHOULD REMEMBER WHY WE ARE DOING THIS, BECAUSE WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY, AND WE WANT IT TO BE THE COUNTRY OF HOPE AND POTENTIAL FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN, THAT MANY OF US SAW COME INTO BEING OVER THE LAST DECADES, SO AS I RUN FOR PRESIDENT, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME VERY DIFFICULT CHALLENGES. WE WILL HAVE DISAGREEMENTS. WE WILL HAVE DEBATES, BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL BE REMEMBERING WHAT I THINK SHOULD BE AT THE CORE OF EVERY POLITICAL CAMPAIGN, HOW WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER, AND HOW WE CARE FOR THIS IF WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. ","Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton in Columbia, South Carolina"

MRS. CLINTON: HI,  HOW  ARE  YOU? WONDERFUL TO  BE  BACK IN  NEVADA AND  HERE AT RANCHO. I'M  DELIGHTED  TO  BE  JOINED BY  A NUMBER  OF  YOUNG PEOPLE WHO  ARE GOING  TO  TALK  WITH  ME  AND  YOU ABOUT  THEIR  LIVES  AND STORIES AND  IN  PARTICULAR, IMMIGRATION. I  WANT  TO OF  KNOWLEDGE MIGHT -- ACKNOWLEDGE MY  FRIEND  AND CONGRESSWOMAN FOR  BEING  HERE.   IT IS  CINCO DE MAYO,  AN ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATE  DAY  TO HAVE  THIS CONVERSATION. I  WANT  TO  THANK EVERYONE  FOR HOSTING US TODAY  AT  THE  HIGH SCHOOL. I'M  LOOKING  FORWARD TO  HEARING FROM  EACH  OF OUR PANEL PARTICIPANTS. I  HAVE  A  LOT OF  MEMORIES  FROM  MY TIME  HERE IN  NEVADA. I'VE GONE DOOR-TO-DOOR  MEETING WITH  FAMILIES  NOT  FAR FROM  THIS SCHOOL. I'VE  MET  WITH A  LOT  OF CULINARY WORKERS WHO  KEEP  THE  ECONOMY GOING  STRONG. I  ACCOMPANIED A REGISTERED NURSE ON  HER  12 HOUR  SHIFT. I  WAS  VERY PLEASED TO  GO  BACK  TO HER  HOME  AND HAVE  DINNER  WITH HER  AND  HER  KIDS. AND  I  KNOW  HOW HARD HIT NEVADANS WERE  BY  THE RECESSION. THIS  STATE  IN  PARTICULAR SUFFERED SOME  VERY  TOUGH  BLOWS. THERE WERE  A  MUCH  HIGHER  THAN AVERAGE HOME FORECLOSURE RATES, FOR  EXAMPLE. A  LOT  OF PEOPLE LOST  TO  THEIR HOURS WERE CUT,  WHICH  MADE  IT DIFFICULT  FOR  THEM  TO  CONTINUE TO MAKE  A  GOOD  LIVING. WE NOW SEE THAT  THE  STATE  IS COMING  BACK FROM THOSE  TOUGH ECONOMIC  TIMES. FAMILIES  HAVE  FOUND  WAYS TO  MAKE IT  WORK  FOR  THEM. WE  ALSO  SAW  PEOPLE ONCE AGAIN STARTING BUSINESSES,  THINKING ABOUT  SENDING THEIR  KIDS  TO COLLEGE. MAYBE  DOING  SOME  HOME  REPAIRS. PUTTING  A  LITTLE  BIT ASIDE  FOR RETIREMENT. WE ARE  NOT  YET BACK  ON  OUR  FEET. WE  HAVE CLIMBED  OUT  OF THE  HOLE, BUT  WE'VE GOT  TO  DO  MORE  THAN JUST  GET  BY. WE  HAVE TO  GET  AHEAD  AND  STAY AHEAD. THERE  ARE  A  LOT OF  WAYS  TO  THINK ABOUT HOW  WE  DO  THAT  TOGETHER. I  THINK  IT IS  IMPORTANT  TO RECOGNIZE  EVEN  WITH ALL  OF  THE HARD  WORK AND SACRIFICE SO  MANY FAMILIES  MADE,  IN MANY  WAYS, THE DECK  IS  STACKED  IN  FAVOR OF THOSE  AT  THE  TOP. I'M WELL AWARE IN  LAS  VEGAS THERE  IS  NOTHING  WORSE THAN  A STACKED  DECK.   I  WANT  TO  RESHUFFLE THE  DECK. I  WANT  TO  BE A CHAMPION FOR HARD-WORKING  AMERICANS. I  WANT TO  WORK ACROSS  PARTY LINES. I  WANT TO  WORK  WITH  THE  PUBLIC AND  THE PRIVATE SECTOR. I  WANT PEOPLE  TO GET  BACK  TO  THE GOOD  OLD-FASHIONED AMERICAN STYLE  OF  PROBLEM SOLVING AND SETTING  US  ON  THE  RIGHT COURSE. TO  HELP RESHUFFLE THE  DECK, PEOPLE  HAVE  TO DO  THEIR  PART. THEY  HAVE  TO STEP UP  AND TAKE EDUCATION  SERIOUSLY. THEY HAVE TO  BE  WILLING  TO  WORK HARD BECAUSE  NOTHING  IS  GIVEN  TO YOU. MY DAD WAS  A  SMALL  BUSINESSMAN. HE  WAS  A  REALLY  SMALL BUSINESSMAN. JUST A  FEW  DAY  WORKERS  FROM TIME TO  TIME. MY  MOM,  MY  BROTHERS. HE UNDERSTOOD  HARD WORK  WAS  THE PATH  FORWARD IN  THE  UNITED STATES. HE  MADE  A GOOD LIVING  FOR  OUR FAMILY. I  WILL FOREVER BE  GRATEFUL  FOR THAT. WHEN  FAMILIES  ARE  STRONG, AMERICA  IS  STRONG. I AM  CONVINCED  HAVING  FOX  FOR FAMILIES  GOING  ALL THE  WAY  BACK TO  MY  YEARS IN  LAW  SCHOOL  AND EVER  SINCE,  THERE  IS  NOTHING MORE  IMPORTANT. IN THIS  CAMPAIGN,  WE HAVE TO WAGE  AND  WIN  FOUR BIG  FIGHTS. ONE IS  TO BUILD  THE  ECONOMY  OF TOMORROW,  NOT  YESTERDAY. WE'VE GOT  TO  BE  REALLY  FOCUSED ON WHAT  IS  GOING  TO  PREPARE YOUNG  PEOPLE  AND  WE  HAVE  TO START  EARLY. EDUCATION  IS  THE  KEY. EDUCATION  IN  THE FIRST  YEARS  OF LIFE  IS  ESSENTIAL. NOW  WE  KNOW  THAT  BRAIN DEVELOPMENT  REALLY HAS  FORMED  BY THE TIME  A  CHILD IS  THREE  OR FOUR. WE'VE  GOT  TO DO  MORE  TO  MAKE SURE  EVERY  CHILD HAS  THE  BEST CHANCE  TO  DO WELL  IN  SCHOOL, TO GET  AHEAD. TO  CHARGE  HIS OR  HER OWN  FUTURE. IT  IS ALSO ESSENTIAL  THAT WE STRENGTHEN  FAMILIES  AND COMMUNITIES. THAT'S MEANS  WE  HAVE  TO  ONCE  AND FOR  ALL FIX  THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. THIS  IS A  FAMILY  ISSUE. IT  IS  AN ECONOMIC ISSUE,  TOO. BUT  IT  IS A  FAMILY ISSUE  AT HEART. IF  WE CLAIM  WE  ARE  FOR  FAMILIES, WE  HAVE TO PULL TOGETHER  AND RESOLVE  THE  OUTSTANDING  ISSUES AROUND  OUR  BROKEN  IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  SUPPORT COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM  . NOTCHES BECAUSE IT  IS  THE  RIGHT THING  TO  DO,  AND IT  IS,  BUT BECAUSE  THEY KNOW IT  STRENGTHENS FAMILIES,  STRENGTHENS  OUR ECONOMY, AND  OUR  COUNTRY. THAT IS  WHY  WE  CAN'T  WAIT ANY LONGER. WE  CAN'T WAIT FOR  A  PATH  TO EQUAL CITIZENSHIP. THIS  IS  WHERE  I  DIFFER WITH EVERYBODY  ON  THE REPUBLICAN SIDE  . MAKE NO  MISTAKE,  NOT  A SINGLE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE  ANNOUNCED OR POTENTIAL  IS  CLEARLY SUPPORTING  A  PATH TO CITIZENSHIP. NOT  ONE. WHEN  THEY  TALK  ABOUT LEGAL STATUS, THAT  IS  CODE  FOR SECOND-CLASS  STATUS. WE  SHOULD NEVER  FORGET  WHO  THIS DEBATE  IS  ABOUT. YOU  ARE  GOING TO  MEET  SOME OF THEM  IN  A  MINUTE. PEOPLE  WHO WORK HARD,  WHO  LOVE THIS  COUNTRY,  WHO PAY  TAXES TO IT  AND  WANTS  NOTHING  MORE  THAN TO BUILD  A GOOD  FUTURE  FOR THEMSELVES  AND THEIR  CHILDREN. WE  ARE  TALKING ABOUT  THE  YOUNG PEOPLE  AT THIS  TABLE. THEY  ARE  DREAMERS IN MUCH MORE THAN  NAME. I  DON'T UNDERSTAND  HOW  ANYONE CAN  LOOK AT  THESE  YOUNG  PEOPLE AND  THINK WE  SHOULD BREAK UP MORE  FAMILIES, OR  TURN  AWAY  MORE HARD  WORKERS WITH TALENT  TO  HELP US  BUILD  THE  KIND OF COUNTRY  WE WANT  TO  SEE. SO  I WILL FIGHT FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION  REFORM AND  A  PATH TO  CITIZENSHIP  FOR YOU  AND  FOR YOUR FAMILY  ACROSS OUR  COUNTRY. I  WILL  FIGHT  TO  STOP  PARTISAN ATTACKS  ON  THE  EXECUTIVE ACTION THAT  WOULD  PUT  DREAMERS, INCLUDING  THOSE  WITH US  TODAY, AT  RISK  OF DEPORTATION. AND  IF CONGRESS  CONTINUES  TO REFUSE  TO  ACT,  I  WOULD DO EVERYTHING  POSSIBLE  UNDER  THE LAW  TO  GO  EVEN  FURTHER. THERE  ARE MORE PEOPLE,  LIKE  MANY PARENTS HAVE  DREAMERS,  AND OTHERS, WITH  DEEP  TIES  AND CONTRIBUTIONS  TO  OUR COMMUNITIES,  WHO  DESERVE  A CHANCE TO  STAY  AND  I  WILL  FIGHT FOR  THEM. THE  LAW  CURRENTLY ALLOWS  FOR SYMPATHETIC  CASES TO  BE REVIEWED. RIGHT  NOW  MOST OF  THESE CASES HAVE NO  WAY  TO  GET  A  REAL HEARING. THEREFORE  WE  SHOULD PUT IN PLACE A SIMPLE,  STRAIGHTFORWARD, ACCESSIBLE  WAY  FOR PARENTS  OF DREAMERS AND  OTHERS  WITH A HISTORY  OF  SERVICE  AND CONTRIBUTION  TO THEIR COMMUNITIES,  TO  MAKE THEIR CASE AND  TO  BE  ELIGIBLE  FOR  THE  SAME DEFERRED  ACTION AS  THEIR CHILDREN. THAT  IS  JUST THE  BEGINNING. THERE IS  MUCH  MORE  TO DO  TO EXPAND AND  ENHANCE  PROTECTIONS FOR  FAMILIES AND  COMMUNITIES  TO REFORM  IMMIGRATION AND ENFORCEMENT, SO  THEY ARE  MORE HUMANE,  TARGETED,  AND EFFECTIVE. TO KEEP BUILDING  THE  PRESSURE FOR  COMPREHENSIVE REFORM. ON  A PERSONAL BASIS,  THE  FIRST TIME  I EVER MET ANYONE  IN  OUR COUNTRY  WORKING WAS  WHEN  I  WAS ABOUT  12  YEARS  OLD,  AS  I  RECALL. THROUGH MY CHURCH, I WAS RECRUITED,  ALONG  WITH  SOME  OTHER GIRLS  IN  SUNDAY SCHOOL,  TO  SERVE AS BABYSITTERS ON  SATURDAY  FOR THE SMALL CHILDREN  SO  THE  OLDER CHILDREN COULD  JOIN  THEIR PARENTS  IN THE  FIELDS. WHEN  I  WAS GROWING UP,  IT  WAS FARM FIELDS  AS  FAR  AS  THE  EYE COULD SEE. THE MIGRANTS,  IMMIGRANT  LABORERS WOULD  COME  UP,  UP  THROUGH THE MIDWEST, CHICAGO, MICHIGAN. WE WERE  ASKED  TO  TRY  TO  HELP OUT. I REMEMBER GOING  TO  THE  CAMPS WHERE  THE  FAMILIES  LIVED. TAKING  CARE  OF  THE LITTLE KIDS, WHILE KIDS  MY  AGE  WERE  DOING HARD  WORK. WHAT STUCK  IN  MY  MIND  WAS  HOW  AT THE END  OF  THE DAY  THERE  WAS  A LONG  ROAD  FROM THE CAMP  THAT WENT OUT  TO  A  DIRT  ROAD  IN  THE MIDDLE  OF THE FIELD. AND THE  BUS  THAT  HAD THE WORKERS THAT  CAME  BACK  AROUND  4:00  IN THE AFTERNOON,  STOPPED AND  LET OFF THE PARENTS  AND  THE OLDER BROTHERS AND  SISTERS. ALL  OF  THESE  KIDS  STARTED RUNNING  DOWN THE PATH  TO SEE THEIR  MOMS  AND  DADS  AND  THEIR BIG  BROTHERS  AND  SISTERS. THEY  WERE SCOOPED  UP  BY  THESE REALLY  TIRED PEOPLE. I JUST  WATCHED  THIS AND THOUGHT, THEY  ARE  JUST  LIKE ME  AND  MY BROTHERS. WHEN MY  DAD  COMES  HOME  FROM WORK. WE GO  OUT TO  SEE  HIM. AFTER HE  HAS  COME  BACK  FROM  HIS DAY  OF  DOING  WHAT  HE  HAD  TO  DO TO  SUPPORT  US. I'VE  NEVER  GOTTEN  THAT EXPERIENCE  OUT  OF  MY  MIND. SO, FOR ME,  THIS  IS  ABOUT  WHAT KIND  OF  PEOPLE  WE  ARE  AND  WHAT KIND OF  COUNTRY  WE HAVE. I AM  CONVINCED  IT  IS  IN  OUR ECONOMIC INTEREST. IT IS  IN  THE INTEREST  OF  OUR VALUES. IT  IS IN  THE  INTEREST  OF  OUR LONG-TERM  SECURITY  AS  A  NATION. SO  YOU  KNOW  WHERE I  STAND. THERE  CAN  BE  NO QUESTION  ABOUT IT. I  WILL  DO  EVERYTHING I CAN,  AS PRESIDENT, AND  IN  THIS  CAMPAIGN, TO MAKE  THIS  CASE. I  KNOW  THERE ARE  PEOPLE  WHO DISAGREE  WITH ME. I  WANT  THEM  TO  HAVE  A CONVERSATION WITH  ME. THE  FACTS  ARE  REALLY CLEAR. WE KNOW  HOW  MUCH  PEOPLE WHO  ARE WORKING  HARD  CONTRIBUTE TO  THE ECONOMY. IN  WHAT  THEY  BUY AND  DO  WHAT THEY  PAY  IN  TAXES. IN  NEW  YORK,  WHICH  I KNOW  ABOUT, OUR UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS PAY MORE  IN  TAXES  THAN  SOME  OF  THE BIGGEST  CORPORATIONS  IN  NEW YORK. SO  I'M READY TO  HAVE  THIS DISCUSSION WITH  ANYBODY, ANYWHERE, ANY  TIME. LET  ME  TURN TO  THE  PEOPLE WHO ARE  LIVING THIS  STORY. I  WANT  YOU  TO  MEET THEM  AND  HEAR FROM  THEM. I'M  GOING  TO  START  WITH YOU,  IF YOU  WILL INTRODUCE  YOURSELF,  AND TALK ABOUT  YOUR  OWN  LIFE  AND WHAT  BRINGS YOU  TO  THE  TABLE TODAY.   BECAUSE  YOU  HIRED A LAWYER.  NOT  AFRAID  SHE  WILL  BE DEPORTED. MRS. CLINTON: TALK  TO  ME  ABOUT WHAT  YOU HAVE  DONE  IN  SCHOOL. HOW  YOU  SEE YOUR  FUTURE. THE  CONTRIBUTIONS YOU  HAVE  MADE AS  A  YOUNG  PERSON. WHAT  YOU  WOULD  LIKE TO  DO FURTHER.  ERICA--   THAT HIS  MOM. PART  OF  OUR JOBS  AS  MOM'S  TO EMBARRASS OUR  CHILDREN  AT  ANY POSSIBLE MOMENT. ALSO WHEN WE  ARE  PROUD  OF  THEM. I'M HAPPY  YOU  ARE  THERE. ERICA,  HOW  DID  YOU  END  UP HERE TODAY? ERICA:  I  AM HERE TO  SHARE  MY STORY. I  CAME  HERE  WHEN I  WAS  TWO  YEARS OLD. MY  PARENTS  AND  I  MADE  THE JOURNEY  HERE  AFTER  WE LOST  MY SISTER. THEY  WANTED  TO GIVE  ME  A  BETTER FUTURE. I  HAVE  A  17-YEAR-OLD BROTHER. MY PARENTS  WOULD QUALIFY  IF  THE LAWSUIT  WAS  LIFTED. I'M  CURRENTLY GOING  TO  CFS. I WANT  TO MAJOR  IN  POLITICAL SCIENCE AND  PSYCHOLOGY. I'M  HERE  WONDERING, WHAT  ARE YOUR PLANS  TO  HELP  MY COMMUNITY AND MY FAMILY  NOT  TO  THAT  IS  WHY  IT  IS SO  IMPORTANT WE  CONTINUE  TO  TRY TO  CHANGE THE  LAWS COMPREHENSIVELY. AS  I  HAVE SAID NUMEROUS TIMES,  I SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION IN  THE  FACE  OF  AN ACTION. I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN  I  WAS  A SENATOR  FOR EIGHT  YEARS, WE  HAD A  FEW CHANCES  TO  TRY  TO  DO  MORE FOR DREAMERS, FOR  COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM,  AND  WE  WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL. WHEN  I  WAS  SECRETARY OF  STATE, I WAS  GREAT  PLEASED TO  BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT  IN THE SENATE  FOR COMPREHENSIVE  IMMIGRATION REFORM. IT WAS  SUCH  A GOOD  SIGNAL  THAT DEMOCRATS  AND  REPUBLICANS  CAN WORK  TOGETHER,  SOLVE  A  DIFFICULT PROBLEM. COULD  PUT  ASIDE PARTISAN DIFFERENCES. THE  SENATE  PASSED  IT  AND THE HOUSE  WOULD  NEVER  TAKE  IT UP. I  THINK  IT  WOULD  HAVE PASSED  IF THEY  HAD  TAKEN  IT  UP. I  THINK  THE  LEADERSHIP IN  THE HOUSE  DECIDED THAT  POLITICALLY THEY  DID  NOT  WANT  TO  DO  THAT BECAUSE  THEY  HAD  PEOPLE WHO  WERE STRONGLY  OPPOSED  TO REFORM. WE  HAVE  TO  KEEP  WORKING ON  IT. THAT IS WHY  YOUR  STORIES ARE IMPORTANT. BECAUSE  WE CAN'T  LOOK  AT  IT  AS THOUGH IT IS  AN  ABSTRACTION. IT  IS  REAL PEOPLE'S LIVES  AND SONY  PEOPLE WHO  HAVE  MADE CONTRIBUTIONS,  WHO  HAVE  WORKED HARD, STARTED BUSINESSES, RAISED TO  THEIR CHILDREN. AS  YOU POINT  OUT,  YOU  HAVE  A BROTHER WHO  IS  A  U.S.  CITIZEN. WE  HAVE  A  LOT  OF  THESE  BLENDED FAMILIES  AND  I  WANT  TO  MAKE  SURE DOCA  AND ALL  OF  THE  CHANGES  THAT HAVE OCCURRED CONTINUE AND  EVEN EXPAND. I  WOULD LIKE  TO  TRY  TO DO MORE ON  THE  PARENTS  OF  DREAMERS WHO ARE  NOT  NECESSARILY INCLUDED. THE BEST WAY  IS TO GET  REFORM  IN CONGRESS AND  TRY  TO  RESOLVE  ALL OF  THIS.  THERE  ARE  SEVERAL THINGS  ABOUT THAT  QUESTION  I WOULD  LIKE  TO  ANSWER. I THINK PEOPLE  IN  THE IMMIGRATION  SYSTEM SHOULD  BE REPRESENTED. WE HAVE  MADE SOME  PROGRESS  ON THAT,  BUT  NOT ENOUGH. I  AM  IN FAVOR,  PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG  PEOPLE,  TO  HAVE REPRESENTATION. I  WOULD  LIKE  EVERYONE TO  HAVE IT. IF WE  CAN PRIORITIZE,  I  WOULD LIKE YOUNG PEOPLE,  PEOPLE  FROM VULNERABLE POPULATIONS,  WHO WOULD  NOT  HAVE THE  SUPPORT  THEY NEED. I  DO  NOT  THINK  THERE  IS  ANYTHING MAGIC  ABOUT  THE  ONE-YEAR. I THINK  WE  NEED TO  LOOK  AT  HOW WE  MAKE  OUR ENTIRE  SYSTEM  MORE HUMANE. I'M  VERY WORRIED ABOUT  DETENTION FACILITIES FOR  PEOPLE  WHO  ARE VULNERABLE, AND  FOUR  CHILDREN. I  THINK WE  COULD  DO  A BETTER JOB IF  WE  PAID  ATTENTION  TO  PEOPLE WHO  HAVE  A RECORD  OF  VIOLENT BEHAVIOR  AND  THAT  WE  HAVE  A DIFFERENT  APPROACH  TOWARDS PEOPLE  WHO  ARE  NOT  IN THAT CATEGORY. I  DO  NOT  THINK WE  SHOULD  PUT CHILDREN  AND VULNERABLE PEOPLE INTO THE  FACILITY  BECAUSE  THEY THINK THEY  ARE  AT  RISK. THERE  PHYSICAL  AND MENTAL  HEALTH ARE  AT  RISK. THESE  ARE  ISSUES  WE SHOULD  GO  AS FAR  AS  WE  CAN TO  GET  THE RESOURCES  TO  PROVIDE SUPPORT AND REPRESENTATION AND  CHANGES  SOME OF  OUR DETENTION PROCESSES WITHIN  THE  KIND OF DISCRETION THE  PRESIDENT  HAS EXERCISED  WITH HIS  EXECUTIVE ORDERS. IT  IS  ALSO  CLEAR  THE PRESIDENT HAS  SAID  MANY  TIMES A  LOT  OF THESE  ISSUES CAN  ONLY  BE RESOLVED  ONCE  AND  FOR  ALL IF  WE HAVE  CHANGES IN  THE  LAW. I  WANT  TO PROTECT PEOPLE. I  WANT  MORE  HUMANE  TREATMENT. NO MATTER  HOW  THE  LAW  IS  WRITTEN OR ENFORCED. AND  TO PUT  THE RESOURCES  BEHIND THAT  AND  CONTINUE TO  FIGHT FOR REFORM.  COULD YOU  EXPLAIN TO  PEOPLE  WHAT THE  THREE  AND  10 RULE  IS?  I  THINK  YOUR EXAMPLE  ILLUSTRATES THE DIFFICULTIES OF  THESE  RULES  THAT ARE APPLIED  TO EVERYBODY  UNDER EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE, LOOKING  OUT TO  THE UNDERLYING  SITUATION. YOU  HAVE  A  SISTER  WHO  IS  A CITIZEN. A FATHER WHO  IS  A  PERMANENT RESIDENT. YOU  CAME  HERE  AT SEVEN  MONTHS, YOU  HAVE  DONE  WELL WITH  YOUR EDUCATION, AND  YOU  ARE  A COMMITTED YOUNG  PERSON. AND YOUR  MOTHER,  WHO  KEPT  THE FAMILY  GOING,  WOULD HAVE  TO LEAVE. IN  ORDER  TO  BE  ABLE  TO PETITION FOR  REENTRY  AND  THEREFORE BE DETERMINED  AS  LEGAL. THAT IS  WAY  I HAVE  PROMOTED, EVER  SINCE  WE  HAVE BEEN  HAVING THIS  DEBATE,  GOING BACK  TO  WHEN I  WAS  IN THE SENATE,  A COMPREHENSIVE  PROGRAM, SIMILAR TO  WHAT  THE  SENATE PASSED  ON  A BIPARTISAN  BASIS,  WHERE  THE PEOPLE  WHO  HAVE  BEEN  HERE  AND HAVE  CONTRIBUTED AND WORKED HARD  ,  YOU WOULD  HAVE  TO  PAY  A  FINE. WE  WOULD WANT  YOU  TO LEARNING LIST. WHICH  IS  NOT A  PROBLEM BEFORE ANYBODY  AROUND  THIS  TABLE. AND  WE  WOULD WANT  YOU  TO  GET IN LINE  TO GET  A  PATH  TO CITIZENSHIP. SO  YOU WOULD  NOT  BE AT  RISK  OF BEING  DEPORTED AND  YOU  WOULD  NOT HAVE  TO LEAVE  THE  COUNTRY  IN ORDER  TO BE ABLE TO  TRY  TO  COME BACK. I  THINK THERE ARE,  THERE  IS AGREEMENT AMONG  THE  PEOPLE  WHO SUPPORT THE  BIPARTISAN  BILL  IN THE SENATE. SOME  OF  THEM  ARE  PAYING  A POLITICAL PRICE  FOR IT. IT  IS  STILL  THE  RIGHT  THING. BECAUSE  WE HAVE  GAINED  SO  MUCH FROM PEOPLE,  LIKE  YOUR  FAMILY, WHO  HAVE  COME  HERE  AND  WORK CHART  AND  MADE  A  CONTRIBUTION. THANK  YOU  FOR  EXPLAINING  THAT. IT  SHOWS  HOW  DIFFICULT IT IS  IN SO  MANY  FAMILIES TO  FIGURE  OUT WHAT  TO  DO. JUAN,  YOU  HAVE  AN  INTERESTING STORY. YOU  ARE  A  ONE OF  THOSE  SMALL BUSINESSMEN. THAT  IS  WHERE  THE  JOBS ARE CREATED. THAT  IS  WHERE THE ENGINE  OF ECONOMIC  RECOVERY COMES  FROM. WHY  DON'T  YOU  TELL US  WHAT  YOU HAVE  BEEN  DOING? JUAN:  MY  NAME IS JUAN  SALAZAR. I  CAME  HERE  WHEN I  WAS  SEVEN. I  GREW  UP  HERE. I'M  UNDOCUMENTED. IT HIT ME  WHEN  I GOT  OUT  OF  HIGH SCHOOL. IT  WAS HARD  TO  FIND  A  JOB. MY  FRIENDS WERE  GETTING  JOBS  OR THEIR  DRIVERS LICENSE. I  GOT  LEFT  BEHIND. THANKS TO DACA, I  WAS  ABLE  TO GET  A  WORK  PERMIT. AS AN IMMIGRANT,  I  DID NOT TAKE NO  OPPORTUNITY  FOR  GRANTED. RIGHT  AWAY I  WENT  TO GO  GET  MY BUSINESS LICENSE. TO  HAVE MY OWN POOL  CLEANING COMPANY. WE  STARTED OFF  WITH  THREE POOLS. I  GOT  MY  BUSINESS  LICENSE. I  WENT TO  GET  CERTIFIED. MY NAME  AND  EVERYTHING. 2-3  LATER, WE HAVE  OVER  50 POOL S, AND  I  AM  GROWING. I MAKE  SURE  I  WORK  HARD. WE DID  NOT HAVE  ANYTHING  WHEN  MY DAD  LOST HIS  JOB. WE  LOST  OUR  HOUSE. WE  HAD  TO SELL FOOD  TO  PAY  THE PHONE BILL'S. IT WAS THE  ONLY WAY  UP  FROM THERE. WE  ARE  WORKING  HARD  EVERY DAY. I'M  LEARNING THROUGH  THE STRUGGLES  WE  HAVE  BEEN  THROUGH, TAKING  IT  STEP-BY-STEP. MRS. CLINTON:  I'M  VERY  PROUD  TO HEAR  YOUR  STORY. LET'S FACE  IT,  YOU  CAN  CLEAN POOLS ALL  YEAR  ROUND  IN  NEVADA. WE  HAVE  A  SHORTER  SEASON WHERE  I LIVE.   THE  FACT  YOU  AND YOUR DAD  REALLY WERE  DETERMINED  TO  RECOVER  FROM LOSING YOUR  HOME, HIS  JOB,  DOING WHAT  YOU  HAD TO DO TO  BE  AS SUCCESSFUL  FOR  POSSIBLE, IS  THE AMERICAN  STORY. THAT IS  WHAT  IS SO  MOVING  ABOUT WHAT  HAPPENED  TO YOU. JUAN:  ONCE  I  GOT MY WORK  PERMIT, I  COULD  NOT  SAY  THE  SAME  THING FOR  MY PERMIT --  MY PARENTS. THEY  DID  NOT  QUALIFIED. Y. I'M  HAPPY FOR  THE ONES  WHO  WERE ABLE  TO. NOW  THEY HAVE  A  SPEED  BUMP. THEY'VE GOT  TO  SLOW  DOWN  NOW. I  JUST  WANT TO  MAKE SURE  MY PARENTS  ARE  PROTECTED. I  WOULD NOT  WISH  THAT  ON ANYBODY. HERE  IN NEVADA, 21% OF  THE BUSINESS  ARE  OWNED BY IMMIGRANTS. WE ARE MAKING, WE  ARE MOVING UP AND  WE  ARE MAKING A  DIFFERENCE. PROVIDING  FOR  OUR  FAMILIES. WE  THAT  IS  GREAT. I THINK YOU  HAVE PUT  AN IMPORTANT  STATISTIC,  WHICH  IS NATIONALLY, SO  MANY  OF THE  NEW SMALL  BUSINESSES  ARE STARTED  BY IMMIGRANTS. THAT IS SOMETHING  WE  SHOULD  BE CELEBRATING, NOT  TRYING  TO PREVENT OR BREAKUP,  BECAUSE  OF STATUS  DIFFERENCES. YOU  ALSO  HAVE THE  FACT  YOU  ARE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR  PARENTS. I WILL  TRY  TO  DO  EVERYTHING  I CAN  TO  AVOID FAMILY  BREAKUP, AVOID  THE  KIND  OF  TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE TO  MANY FAMILIES  HAVE GONE  THROUGH,  BECAUSE THEY  WERE SPLIT  UP. HALF  OF THEIR  FAMILY,  OR THE BREADWINNER  IS PICKED  UP  AND GONE  ONE  DAY. IT  IS  NOT SMART  AND  IT  IS  NOT RIGHT. DO  YOU  WANT  TO SHARE  YOUR  STORY?  I SHOULD  BRAG  ON YOU. YOU  HAVE  THE  HIGHEST  GRADE  POINT AVERAGE  IN  THE  WHOLE  CLASS. RIGHT?   ONE OF  YOUR  COUNSELORS  TOLD  ME IT WAS  4.8. I DID  NOT  KNOW  IT  WENT  THAT TIE. YOU ARE  EXACTLY  THE  KIND  OF STUDENT  THAT  EVERY  FAMILY, EVERY COMMUNITY SHOULD  BE PROUD  OF. THE IDEA  YOU  WANT  TO  BE  A  DOCTOR IS  SOMETHING  WE  SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING  AND  TRYING TO  CLEAR THE  PATH  SO  YOU  CAN GO  ON  AND  DO THAT. TELL  ME  ABOUT  YOUR FAMILY. WHAT  HAPPENED WITH  THE  REST  OF YOUR  FAMILY?  HOWEVER,  HE  REALLY  CAN'T. MRS. CLINTON:  I  THINK IT  IS IMPORTANT  TO PUT  FACES BEHIND THE  STORIES. SEVERAL OF  YOU  HAVE  MENTIONED HOW  THE LAWSUIT  TRIED  TO  PREVENT THE IMPLEMENTATION  OF  PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. HOW THAT  HAS  STOPPED  PLANS  FOR NEW BUSINESSES, FOR  GOING TO SCHOOL, WHAT  YOU  ARE  GOING TO  DO WHEN  YOU  GRADUATE. CREATING  MORE  AND  CERTAINTY. THAT  IS  WHAT  YOU  ARE  DESCRIBING WITH  RESPECT  TO  YOUR  FATHER. I THINK THAT  CERTAINTY  IS  REALLY IMPORTANT. PREDICTABILITY. REGULARIZATION,  IF  YOU  WILL. PEOPLE  NEED TO  KNOW  WHAT  IS GOING  TO  HAPPEN. IT  IS UNREALISTIC  AND, I THINK, FOOLISH  TO  CONTINUE  TO  TALK  AS THOUGH  WE  ARE  GOING  TO DEPORT 11 MILLION  OR  12  MILLION  PEOPLE. THAT  IS  NOT  GOING  TO  HAPPEN. WHEN  YOU ACCEPT  THE  FACT  THAT IS NOT  GOING  TO  HAPPEN,  RIGHT? I ONCE  CALCULATED  WHEN  I  WAS IN THE  SENATE  HOW  MUCH  MONEY  IT WOULD  COST,  HOW  MANY  BUSES WOULD BE  REQUIRED. IT IS BEYOND ABSURD. THAT IS  NOT  GOING  TO  HAPPEN. WHAT  WE  HAVE TO DO IS  ACCEPT  THE FACT WE  ARE  A  NATION  OF IMMIGRANTS. WE  ALWAYS  HAVE  BEEN. IT  WAS FRANKLIN  ROOSEVELT WHO MIGHT HAVE  SAID  WE  STARTED  OFF AS  A  NATION  OF REVOLUTIONARIES AND  IMMIGRANTS. THAT  HAS  CONTINUED THROUGHOUT OUR  HISTORY. WE  HAVE  TO  SOLVE  THE  ISSUES  THAT ARE AROUND  THIS  SITUATION WE  ARE FACED  WITH. THE  FACTS  ARE REALLY CLEAR  ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS, THE ECONOMIC CONSUMER  CONTRIBUTIONS, THE PAYING OF  TAXES,  AND THEN  THE YOUNG  PEOPLE  WHO WORK  HARD  AND ARE LOOKING FOR  A  PLACE IN SOCIETY. I  KNOW  THAT YOU HAVE HAD PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. NOW  IS  YOUR  CHANCE  TO MAYBE  SAY WHAT YOU THINK SHOULD  BE  DONE AND  HOW  IT  SHOULD BE  DONE  SO THAT WE  HAVE  A  DEBATE  THAT  IS ABOUT THE  REALITIES,  NOT ABOUT THE  TALKING  POINTS  AND THE ARGUMENTS. WOULD  YOU  LIKE TO  START?  ON  SEVERAL  OF  THOSE ISSUES. MRS. CLINTON:  UNIFICATION SHOULD BE  ONE  OF OUR GOALS  IN COMPREHENSIVE  IMMIGRATION REFORM. BECAUSE WE  HAVE  ATTEMPTED TO DEAL WITH  THIS CHALLENGE  FOR YEARS NOW  AND IN  THE  ABSENCE  OF ACTUALLY FINALLY PASSING REFORM, A  LOT OF  FAMILIES HAVE  BEEN BROKEN  UP. THAT IS  REALLY SO  PAINFUL  FOR PEOPLE WHO  LIVE  THROUGH IT,  AND EVEN  THOSE  ON THE  OUTSIDE TO EVEN IMAGINE  WHAT  THAT  MUST  BE LIKE. THAT  IS  WHY  I  WANT  TO DO EVERYTHING  WE CAN TO  DEFEND  THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS. I  THINK THEY  WERE  WITHIN  HIS AUTHORITY, CONSTITUTIONALLY, LEGALLY,  THEY  WERE  BASED  ON PRECEDENT THAT  I  BELIEVE  IS ADEQUATE. AND STILL  TRY  TO  GO  FURTHER, LIKE THE  UNIFICATION OF  FAMILIES THAT  HAVE  BEEN SPLIT  UP. YES.  I  THINK  WE  HAVE  TO DO MORE  TO  PROVIDE  A  SAFE ENVIRONMENTS FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THAT  CERTAINLY INCLUDES LGBT COMMUNITY, CHILDREN,  AND UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN. THERE  ARE  GROUPS OF PEOPLE  WHO WE  DESERVE A  HIGHER  LEVEL  OF CARE,  BECAUSE  OF THE SITUATIONS THEY ARE  FINDING  THEMSELVES  IN. I ALSO THINK  WE  HAVE  TO REFORM OUR  DETENTION  SYSTEM. I'M  NOT  SURE A  LOT  OF  AMERICANS KNOW  A  LOT OF  THE  DETENTION FACILITIES FOR IMMIGRANTS  ARE RUN  BY  PRIVATE  COMPANIES. THEY  HAVE  A BUILT  IN  INCENTIVE TO  FILL  THEM UP. THERE IS  ACTUALLY  A  LEGAL REQUIREMENT THAT  SO  MANY  BEDS  BE FILLED. SO  PEOPLE GO  OUT  AND  ROUND  UP PEOPLE  IN ORDER  TO  GET PAID ON  A PER  DAY  BASIS. THAT  MAKES NO  SENSE  TO  ME. THAT IS  NOT  THE  WAY  WE  SHOULD  BE RUNNING ANY DETENTION FACILITY. THERE  IS A  LOT  WE  HAVE  TO DO  TO CHANGE  WHAT  IS  CURRENTLY HAPPENING  AND  TRIED  TO  PUT  US  ON A  PATH  TOWARD  A BETTER,  HUMANE SYSTEM  FOR  EVERYBODY.  TO  MAKE  A  LIVING  WAGE. MRS. CLINTON: I  AGREE WITH  THAT COMPLETELY,  AT  THE FEDERAL LEVEL. DAVE  AND SOME  CITIES  ARE  ON THEIR  OWN RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE. THERE  NEEDS  TO BE  A  FEDERAL CORE. I BELIEVE  THE DEMOCRATS  WILL INTRODUCE LEGISLATION  TO  DO  THAT THIS WEEK. I  AGREE  WITH  YOU.  IT  WILL BE  AMONG MY  FIRST INITIATIVE'S. I  CAN'T PREDICT  WHAT  WILL  BE HAPPENING. THAT  HAPPENED  TO  PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN HE  WAS  ELECTED  AND  FOUND OUT  WE  WERE  FALLING  INTO  AN ECONOMIC ABYSS. HE  DESERVES  A  LOT OF CREDIT  FOR RE-STABILIZING  THE  SITUATION  AND GETTING  US  BACK  ON THE ECONOMIC UPSWING. AMONG  THE  PRIORITIES  I  WOULD BE ADVOCATING FOR  IN  THE  BEGINNING WOULD  BE  COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION  REFORM. ONE  OF  THE  REASONS FOR THAT,  AS SECRETARY OF  STATE, I  SAW  WHAT HAPPENED  TO  COUNTRIES THAT ESTABLISHED  A  SECOND-CLASS STATUS  FOR  PEOPLE. THEY DO  NOT  FEEL THEY  BELONG,  OR THEY HAVE ANY ALLEGIANCE  TO  THE COUNTRY  IN  WHICH  THEY LIVE  AND WORK. THEY  ARE  NEVER FULLY  ACCEPTED. THAT  IS A  RECIPE  FOR  DIVISIVE NESTS -- DIVISIVENESS  AND DISINTEGRATION. MY VIEW IS  THAT  WE  ARE A  NATION OF  IMMIGRANTS. WE HAVE ASSIMILATED TENS  AND TENS OF  MILLIONS  OF  PEOPLE  OVER THE COURSE  OF  OUR  HISTORY. WE  HAVE  11, 12  MILLION  PEOPLE WHO  ARE  UNDOCUMENTED. THE  VAST  MAJORITY OF  WHOM  HAVE PROVEN  THEY WANT  TO  BE  A  CITIZEN OF THIS  COUNTRY AND  WE  SHOULD PUT  THEM  ON THAT  PATH. THOSE WHO SAY  WE  CAN DO  REFORM, BUT NOT  A  PATH  TO  CITIZENSHIP, WOULD  BE  UNDERMINING  WHAT  HAS MADE  AMERICA A  UNIQUE. THE  WAY  WE  HAVE  ASSIMILATED PEOPLE. THE WAY  PEOPLE  FEEL  LOYAL,  THE CONTRIBUTIONS THEY  MAKE. THIS  IS NOT JUST THE  RIGHT THING TO  DO  FOR AMERICA, IF  YOU COMPARE US  TO  OTHER COUNTRIES THAT  DID  NOT  TAKE THAT  STEP,  YOU CAN SEE  WHAT IT  HAS  DONE  TO THEM. I DON'T  WANT  TO  GO  THERE. I  SUPPORT  A  PATH  TO  CITIZENSHIP IN  THE CONSTEXT  OF IMMIGRATION  REFORM. JUAN: I  WANTED TO  ADD  A  PERSONAL STORY. WHEN I  GRADUATED HIGH  SCHOOL,  I COULD  NOT  FIND  ANY WORK. MY  DAD  WAS  NOT  WORKING  AS  WELL. WE FOUND  A  LANDSCAPING  JOB. DOING  LABOR  FOR  A  COMPANY. WE  WERE  GETTING  PAID  SIX  DOLLARS AN  HOUR. THEY  WOULD  WORK  US  EXCESSIVELY. I WAS  YOUNG. WORKING REALLY HARD. IT'S  GOT  TO A POINT  WHERE  I REMEMBER  WE  HAD BEEN WORKING. WE  COULD  NOT  LOOK  AT  THE BOSS  IN THE  EYE. EVEN  IF  IT  WAS  LUNCHTIME, YOU HAD  TO  WORK. A  LOT  OF  STORIES LIKE  THAT. OTHER STORIES  WITH  STUFF  LIKE THAT. IT  IS  REALLY  HARD. ME  AND  MY  DAD  WORKED REALLY HARD. WHEN  HE  WOULD GET  HOME  FROM WORK,  AND  I  WOULD  SEE  HIM LIMPING, THAT  IS  WHAT  MOTIVATED ME  TO  DO  SOMETHING FOR  US. HE RAISED  ME  TO RESPECT EVERYONE AND  TO BE HONEST  AND  SUPPORTED ME WITH  SCHOOL. JUST  LOOKING OUT  FOR  HIM. I'M  REALLY  GLAD  HE  IS  MY BUSINESS   I BET  HE  WOULD SAY THE SAME  THING ABOUT  YOU. YOU  MAKE  A GOOD  POINT. IT  IS  NOT ONLY  ABOUT  MINIMUM WAGE  AND  DECENT WORKING CONDITIONS  FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU. OFTEN  TIMES  IT IS ABOUT CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE  FEARFUL  ABOUT  IMMIGRATION REFORM. THEIR FEARS  ARE  ROOTED  IN  THE FEELING THEY  ARE  LOSING  JOBS. THEY ARE  GOING  TO  PEOPLE  WHO  ARE UNDOCUMENTED. PART OF  THAT FEAR  HAS  A  REALITY TO  IT BECAUSE PEOPLE  PAY  YOU  SIX DOLLARS AN  HOUR,  BECAUSE  YOU  ARE UNDOCUMENTED. WHY WOULD  THEY  PAY  SOMEBODY  WHO IS A CITIZEN  WHAT  THE  MINIMUM WAGE SHOULD  BE? I  ARGUMENT IS TO PUT -- THE BETTER  THE  JOB MARKET WILL  BE FOR  EVERYBODY. YOU  WILL  NOT  HAVE  A  GROUP  OF PEOPLE  WHO  ARE  TAKEN  ADVANTAGE OF  AND  YOU  DO  NOT HAVE  OTHERS WHO  FEEL AS  THOUGH  THEY  ARE LOSING JOBS  BECAUSE THIS  GROUP IS  BEING  TAKEN  ADVANTAGE  OF  AND THEY  ARE  PAID  LESS  AND  TREATED WORSE. MY ARGUMENT  TO PEOPLE  WHO  WORRY ABOUT  COMPREHENSIVE  REFORM  AND THE  EFFECT  ON  THEIR JOB  IS,  IT IS  THE  OPPOSITE. THE  SOONER  WE  CAN GET  TO LEGALIZATION, THE BETTER  THE  JOB MARKET  WILL  BE  FOR  EVERYBODY. EMPLOYERS  WILL NOT  BE ABLE  TO VIOLATE  THE  LAWS. BECAUSE THEY  ARE  NOT  DEALING WITH  A  WORKFORCE THAT  IS  SCARED TO  SAY  ANYTHING, OR  EVEN  SCARED TO  LOOK AT  THE  BOSS  WHEN  HE SHOWS UP. THIS IS  ABOUT EVERYBODY. NOT  JUST  YOU  AND  YOUR DAD. JUAN:  ONE  MORE QUESTION. I  JUST  WANTED TO SAY,  I  KNOW HERE IN NEVADA, EDUCATION,  WE KEEP ON LOWERING THE EDUCATION. A  LOT  OF KIDS  AREN'T  GRADUATING. WE NEED  TO  REACH  OUT  TO  THESE KIDS  AND SHOW  THEM THAT  SCHOOL IS  VERY IMPORTANT  AND  SO  IS HIGHER  EDUCATION. MAYBE  WE  NEED  TO  FIGURE OUT  SOME OTHER  WAY. A LOT  OF  THE  REASON IS  BECAUSE OF  FUNDING. THEY  CAN'T  AFFORD  IT. SO  THEY  DECIDE  NOT  TO  GO  TO  THAT  IS  A  BIG PART  OF  WHAT  WE HAVE  TO DO. WHETHER  IT  IS  COMMUNITY  COLLEGE OR  COLLEGE  OR  A  JOB  TRAINING PROGRAM  THAT  WILL  GIVE  THEM A GOOD  START. AND MAKE -- YOU  MAKE A  STRONG POINT. IT  IS  SO  EXPENSIVE  TO  CONTINUE YOUR  EDUCATION  THAT  TOO  MANY KIDS ARE  FEELING AND  THEIR PARENTS  ARE FEELING IT IS  THE  ON THEIR  REACH. THAT  IS  WHY I SUPPORT  PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PROPOSAL  FOR  FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHICH  AT  LEAST GET YOU  STARTED  AND  I  WOULD  LIKE TO  LOOK TO  SEE  HOW WE GET  THE DEBT UNDER  CONTROL  AND  GIVE PEOPLE  A CHANCE TO  NOT  BE BURDENED BY  DEBT  WHICH  MAKES IT REALLY  HARD  FOR  THEM  TO  START A BUSINESS  OR TO  CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION  SO  THIS  IS GOING  TO  BE A  BIG  PART  OF  MY  EDUCATION POLICY  AS  I GO  FORWARD  WITH THE CAMPAIGN. YOU  ARE 100%  RIGHT. TOO  MANY  PEOPLE FEEL  IT  IS  OUT OF  THEIR REACH  OR  THEY  GRADUATE WITH  SOME  MUCH  DEBT THEY  FEEL LIKE  THEY ARE  PARALYZED. THEY  DO  NOT  KNOW  WHAT  TO DO  AND THEY CANNOT  BUY  A  HOUSE, THEY CANNOT  GET  MARRIED,  THEY CANNOT START  A BUSINESS  BECAUSE  THE  OH SO  MUCH IN  STUDENT  DEBT.  -- THEY  OWE SO  MUCH IN  STUDENT DEBT. THE  AVERAGE  STUDENT IN  IOWA GRADUATES WITH THOUSANDS  DOLLARS OF  DEBT. YOU  HAVE A  LOT OF  PEOPLE WHO  DO NOT  HAVE THAT MUCH  ASSETS AND INCOME  SO  IT  IS  RELATIVE  TO  WHAT THEY  CAN  AFFORD. I  LEARNED TODAY  THAT THIS SCHOOL USES TITLE I FUNDS TO PAY  FOR THE AP  EXAM  FEE. WHEN  YOU  LOOK  AT  HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION, MAKING  IT  POSSIBLE FOR  MORE  STUDENTS TO  HAVE  ACCESS TO ADVANCED PLACEMENT COURSES REALLY  UPSET  LEVEL OF  EDUCATION. IT GIVES  KIDS  A LEG UP  BECAUSE THEY  MAY HAVE  SOME  CREDIT  BEFORE THEY EVER  GET  THERE  BUT  TOO  MANY KIDS IN  THE  PAST  AND  ACROSS OUR COUNTRY  DO  NOT  TAKE  THE TEST BECAUSE  I  DO  NOT  KNOW WHAT  IT DOES  TODAY.  $80? 85. THAT  IS  A LOT  OF MONEY  IF  YOU'RE ARE  MAKING MINIMUM  WAGE  OR  LESS. I HOPE  THE  ADMINISTRATORS ARE STILL  HERE. I WANT  TO  GIVE  THEM  A  BIG  SHOUT OUT FOR  USING  TITLE ROOM AND  ONE  -- TITLE I  FUNDING. I  AM  SURE  YOU  WILL  DO SOME  OF THAT  NEXT  YEAR. OR  CURRENTLY. YOU  HAVE  THEM  TOMORROW?   WOW.  IT  IS  VERY SHORTSIGHTED  OF  US  NOT TO LEGALIZE  STUDENTS WHO  GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE AND  CAN  USE THEIR SKILLS TO  MAKE A  GOOD LIFE  FOR THEMSELVES  BUT ALSO TO  GIVE BACK. WE HAVE  THOUSANDS  OF  FOREIGN STUDENTS COME  TO  OUR  COUNTRY EVERY YEAR. THEY  GET  A GREAT EDUCATION IN OUR  COLLEGES  AND  UNIVERSITIES AND  A  LOT  OF  THEM  STAY. I  WANT  YOU  TO BE  A  DOCTOR  IF THAT  IS  WHAT  YOU WANT  TO  BE. YOU HAVE,  TO  OUR  SYSTEM,  YOU HAVE WORKED HARD, YOU  HAVE  DONE EXCEPTIONALLY WELL. I  THINK  THIS  IS  THE PARTICULAR FIX  IN  ADDITION TO  THE  OTHER FIXES WE  HAVE  BEEN  TALKING ABOUT. I READ  AN  ARTICLE  RECENTLY ABOUT A  GROUP  OF YOUNG, UNDOCUMENTED MEN WHO WERE REALLY  INTERESTED IN  TECHNOLOGY  AND  THE  ENTERED A CONTEST  AGAINST  KIDS FROM  THE BEST  SCHOOLS  AND COMPANIES  AND THEY  WON. SO  YOU  HAVE FOUR KIDS  WHO  BEAT THE  BEST  OF THE BEST  AND  THEY COULD NOT  DO  ANYTHING  BECAUSE THEY  WERE  UNDOCUMENTED. I'M  SITTING  THERE  THINKING, WHAT IS  WRONG  WITH  THIS  PICTURE? WE  ARE  IN A GLOBAL  OPPOSITION AND  I  INTEND  FOR  US  TO  WIN  IT AND  I'M ABOUT --  NOT  ABOUT  TO LET  ANYONE  WHO  CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO  OUR  ECONOMY  AND SOCIETY GET  THROWN  AWAY. FROM  MY  PERSPECTIVE WE NEED TO FIX THAT,  WE  NEED  TO  REMOVE THE FEAR,  AND  WE  NEED TO  MAKE  SURE THAT  WE  GIVE EVERY CHILD  A CHANCE TO  DO  THE  BEST  THAT  HE  OR SHE CAN. IF  THAT  MEANS  GOING TO  YALE  AND BECOMING  A DOCTOR --    AS  YOU  CAN TELL,  I  COULD  BE  HERE ALL  DAY. WE HAVE SIX  EXCEPTIONAL YOUNG PEOPLE,  WE  HAVE  SOME PROUD PARENTS  AND GRANDPARENTS  AND TEACHERS  HERE. BUT LET ME  AND  WHERE  I  STARTED. THINKING  RANCHO FOR  HAVING  ME HERE,  THINKING EACH  OF  YOU FOR BEING  WILLING  AND  BRAVE  ENOUGH TO  SIT  HERE  AND TALK ABOUT  YOUR OWN  LIVES. I  WANT  TO  REITERATE MY  STRONG SUPPORT FOR  THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ACTION BECAUSE  HE  HAD TO  ACT  IN  THE  FACE OF INACTION THAT WAS  NOT  ON  THE  MERITS  BUT POLITICALLY  MOTIVATED. FOR  PARTISAN REASONS  WHICH  I THINK  IS  NOT THE WAY  WE  SHOULD BE  SOLVING  OUR  PROBLEMS IN  OUR COUNTRY. IN  OUR  CONGRESS OR  ANYWHERE ELSE. I  AM SO  PLEASED THAT  THE CONGRESSWOMAN  IS  HERE BECAUSE  I KNOW  SHE  IS A  CHAMPION  FOR  A  LOT OF  THE  ISSUES THAT  WE  ARE TALKING  ABOUT. I WANT  TO  GET  BACK TO  GOOD OLD-FASHIONED  PROBLEM-SOLVING AND  THIS  IS  ONE  OF  THE  PROBLEMS WE  HAVE  TO  SOLVE  TOGETHER SO  I PLEDGE  TO  YOU  I  WILL  DO EVERYTHING I  POSSIBLY CAN  TO MAKE  THIS  AN  ISSUE  IN  THE CAMPAIGN BUT  MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHEN I  AM  PRESIDENT,  TO  PUT  IT ON  THE TOP  OF  MY  PRIORITY LIST. YOU  STAY  HERE. WE WILL GET THE PRINCIPAL  AND OTHERS  TO  COME UP  AND  JOIN  US. LET'S GET THE ADMINISTRATORS  WHO INVITED  US  ALL HERE TO  COME  AND STAND. IF  YOU  WILL  STAND  WITH  US  WE WILL GET  A  PICTURE  WITH EVERYBODY. WHY  DO  YOU  JOIN  US?  -- WHY  DON'T  YOU  JOIN  US? WRITE  ME  A  MEMO  ON WHAT  I  NEED TO  DO  DIFFERENTLY.   YOU  WANT  TO  COME  AROUND? WE  ALL  STAND  UP. THAT IS  GOOD. EXCELLENT. OK,  COME  CLOSER. AND JUAN,  GIVE ME  THAT. THAT'S  GREAT. OK,  LOOK  AT BARB  AND  WE  WILL LOOK  AT ALL THE  PROUD  PARENTS WITH THEIR  CAMERAS. OK,'S  A  LOOK  OVER  HERE.  -- SO  LOOK OVER  HERE. OK, GOT  SOME  CAMERAS  OVER HERE. IT'S  LIKE  WHEN  YOU  ARE  ON THE RED  CARPET. LOOK  HERE. OK. THANK  YOU. YOU WANT  TO  COME  AROUND? I  AM  SO  HAPPY I  COULD. THANK  YOU  SO  MUCH.   IS  YOUR NAME BARBARA?   YOU  HAVE TO  WATCH THE  CAMPAIGN STARTING  WITH  WHAT I  DID  TODAY. THANK  YOU.        ",Hillary Clinton Immigration Roundtable

SECRETARY CLINTON, AS  I MENTIONED,  YOU  ARE  SENATOR FROM NEW  YORK. WHY  SHOULD THE  COUNTRY  CARE ABOUT THE  CITIES  SUCCESS OR FAILURE? FMR.  SEC.  OF  STATE CLINTON:I JOIN  WITH  LEE  AND  THANKING YOU FOR  JOINING US TOGETHER  ON  THIS. I THINK  YOU,  LEE, AS  WELL  AS APNE  FOR  MOTIVATED THIS CONVERSATION. I  DID  REPRESENT NEW YORK FOR EIGHT  YEARS. NOT  ONLY  NEW YORK  CITY,  BUT ROCHESTER, ALBANY,  AND  A  LOT  OF OTHER PLACES  THAT  HAD  VERY DIFFERENT  CHALLENGES. THEY  ALL FELL  UNDER  THE  CATEGORY OF  HOW  DO WE  MAKE  SURE  OUR CITIES  ARE GOOD  PLACES  FOR PEOPLE  TO  LIVE AND  WORK. THAT HAS  BECOME EVEN  MORE IMPORTANT  AS  WE  HAVE WATCHED  HOW CITIES ARE DRIVING  ECONOMIC PROSPERITY. IT  USED  TO  BE  THAT  JOBS  WERE MOVING  OUT  OF  CITIES  INTO SUBURBS AND  RURAL AREAS. THAT  TREND  IS REVERSING. PEOPLE WANT  TO  LIVE  IN  CITIES. THERE  ARE ALL  KINDS  OF  REASONS. THERE  IS  RESEARCH  THAT  I'M  SURE WE  WILL  HEAR FROM RUSE ABOUT MILLENNIAL'S  MONEY TO  LIVE  AND WORK  IN  THE  SAME  PLACE. CITIES HAVE  ALWAYS  BEEN  ENTERED A PROSPERITY. NOW,  WHAT  WE'RE SEEING  IS  UNLESS WE  PAY  ATTENTION AND  COME  UP WITH SOME VERY CREATIVE,  AND  I WOULD  ARGUE, AFFECTED  SOLUTION  -- EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS,  WE  WILL NOT  SEE  OUR CITIES  DOING  WHAT THEY  DO  BEST. IT GOES TO LEAVE  POINT -- LEES POINT. A  LOT  OF OUR CITIES  ARE  DIVIDED. THEY  HAVE A  LOT  OF  INEQUALITY. THEY  HAVE  SOME  OF  THE  MOST EDUCATED  AND  AFFLUENT  PEOPLE  IN THE  WORLD,  AND  PEOPLE TRAPPED IN INTERRACIAL POVERTY  WITH  JOBS ARE  NOT KEEPING UP  WITH  THE  DEMAND. I'M  LOOKING  AT  AT  NOT ONLY  WHAT CAN  BE  DONE  BY  WORKING  ACROSS GOVERNMENTAL  LINES -- AS  LEE SAID,  THAT HAS  TO  BE  ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. BUT,  WHAT  WE  CAN DO  IN PARTNERSHIP  WITH  THE  PUBLIC AND PRIVATE  SECTORS. I'M  GLAD  WE  HAVE PEOPLE  ON  THE PANEL  SPEAKING  TO THAT. LET  ME  JUST  MAKE  THREE QUICK POINTS. ONE,  I THINK THAT  WE,  FOR  LONG TIME  AT  THE  FEDERAL LEVEL,  BUT ALSO THE  LOCAL  LEVEL,  HAVE SHIFTED RESOURCES  TO  FOLLOW PEOPLE. WE  SHIFTED RESOURCES  OUT  OF CITIES. IT MADE  SENSE. RHODES  HAD  TO  BE  DEVELOPED. ALL KINDS  OF UTILITIES  AND INFRASTRUCTURE  HAD TO  BE  PUT INTO  PLACE IN  SUBURBAN  AREAS  AND FURTHER OUT. I  REMEMBER HAVING  AL  QAEDA CONVERSATIONS AS  A SENATOR WITH PEOPLE  WHO  WANTED  TO BRING  JOBS TO  UPSTATE  NEW  YORK, IN PARTICULAR. THEY WOULD  MOVE  OUT  TO  WHAT  THEY CALLED  GREEN  AREAS,  OR  CLEAN AREAS. EVEN  THOUGH  THE  UTILITIES  OR INFRASTRUCTURE  WAS  IN  THE  OLD CITIES. HOW  DO  WE  BEGIN  TO  MAKE  WHAT  WE ALREADY  HAVE  MORE  OF  AN ATTRACTION? THAT RAISES THE  SECOND  POINT. HOW  DO  WE  REPAIR  AN  UPDATE  OF OUR OF  OUR  INFRASTRUCTURE? IN  A  LOT OF  THE  OLDER  CITIES, WE HAVE  TERRIBLE  PROBLEMS  WITH WATER  SYSTEMS,  SEWER SYSTEMS,  TO SAY  NOTHING  OF  NOT  KEEPING  UP WITH  AN ELECTRIC  GRID  OR BROADBAND ACCESS. WE  HAVE TO  DO  WHAT  WE  WOULD  HOPE TO SEE  TO  BE  A  MAPPING  OF  OUR CITIES  AND  UNDERSTANDING  THAT WHEN  IT  COMES  TO  THE  PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, WE  HAVE  TO  TAKE CARE  OF  WHAT  WE ALREADY  HAVE, UPDATED, MODERNIZE  IT. WE HAVE  POTHOLES  IN NEW YORK. ALL KINDS OF  ISSUES. WE HAVE  TO  REALLY INVEST  AND THEN  GO  INTO  THE  FUTURE. THE  SECOND  ISSUE IS  THE  HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT  IS  THE MOST  IMPORTANT  PART OF  ANY  CITY. IT  IS  THE  MOST IMPORTANT  PART  OF OUR  ENTIRE COUNTRY. WHAT  DO  WE  DO TO  BETTER  EQUIP THE  PEOPLE TO GET  JOBS. HOW  DO WE  KEEP MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES  IN  CITIES WHERE  THEY WANT  TO  STAY? THEY DON'T  WANT  TO  LEAVE  BUT THEY ARE  BEING PRICED  OUT. WE NEED TO  DO  MORE TO  FIT  THE HUMAN  NEEDS -- STARTING EARLY, WITH PRE-K. I'M  VERY  IN  FAVOR OF WHAT  MERIT OF  LOSS YIELDED IN  YORK, CREATING  PRE-K  ACCESS FOR  EVERY CHILD  IN  NEW YORK,  REGARDLESS  OF WHO  THAT  CHILD IS  AND  WHO  THEIR PARENTS  ARE. WE  ALSO  NEED  TO DO MORE  WHEN  IT COMES  TO  AFFORDABLE HOUSING  SO THAT FAMILIES CAN  STAY  IN CITIES. I WANT  TO  PUBLICLY  ACKNOWLEDGE RANDY BECAUSE THROUGH  A  CLINTON GLOBAL IN NOTION INITIATIVE  COME MID-MAY,  PUBLIC  PENSION  MONEY WAS PULLED  TO  TRAIN  PEOPLE TO DO ENERGY RETROFITS. THEY  HAVE NOW  CREATED  TENS  OF THOUSANDS  OF  JOBS. THAT'S THE  KIND  OF  CREATIVE  WORK THAT WE  CAN  DO  TOGETHER. I'VE  OBVIOUSLY PROUD  THAT CGI HELP  TO  MAKE  THAT HAPPEN. THE  FINAL  POINT  I  WANT  TO MAKE IS  THIS. WE  KNOW  A  LOT  ABOUT  SOCIAL L  MOBILITY. ONE  OF  THE  BIGGEST  ISSUES THAT WE  FACE  IS INCOME  INEQUALITY COMBINED WITH  WAGE  STAGNATION. WE  DON'T  HAVE  ENOUGH GOOD  JOBS OR  SOCIAL MOBILITY. THERE  ARE  SOME  REALLY INTERESTING WORK  BEING DONE  BY  A PROFESSOR  AND  HIS  COLLEAGUES  AT THE  HARVARD. I  THINK  IT REALLY  WAKES  US  UP  AS TO  WHAT  WE ARE  FACING. THEY  HAVE  LOOKED AT  THE INDICATORS  OF  SOCIAL MOBILITY. WHY  DO  SOME COMMUNITIES  HAVE, FRANKLY, MORE  LADDERS FOR OPPORTUNITY  THAN  OTHER COMMUNITIES? HOW  DO  WE  PROMOTE SUCCESS  AND UPWARD  MOBILITY? IS  NOT  ONLY  ABOUT AVERAGE INCOMES,  AS IMPORTANT  AS  THAT IS. YOU  CAN  LOOK AT CITIES THAT  ON AVERAGE HAVE SIMILAR  AFFLUENCE, BUT  PEOPLE ARE  TRAPPED AND  NOT ABLE  TO  MOVE  UP  IN ONE CITY,  AND ARE MOVING  UP  IN  ANOTHER. I  WILL  GIVE YOU  TWO  EXAMPLES. TWO CITIES  WITH  SIMILAR AFFLUENCE. SEATTLE AND ATLANTA. THEY HAVE  MARKEDLY  DIFFERENT RATES OF  ECONOMIC  MOBILITY. IT'S  NOT ABOUT  RACE -- WHITE AND BLACK  CITIZENS OF  A CITY  LIKE ATLANTA BOTH HAVE LOW  OUT  WORD. IT  TURNS  OUT THAT PLACES  WHERE THE FABRIC  OF  COMMUNITY  IS STRONG, WITH  A  VIBRANT  MIDDLE CLASS, PLACES  THAT  ARE  MORE INTEGRATED ACROSS  CLASS,  PLACES WITH  GOOD SCHOOLS,  PLACES  WITH UNIONS,  PLACES WITH RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS  AND  CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS HELP  PEOPLE  FEEL ROOTED,  PART  OF A  COMMUNITY,  AND THEN ARE  ABLE  TO  PULL  TOGETHER ALL  OF THE  ASPECTS  THAT FULL FACTOR INTO  UPWARD MOBILITY. WE  NOW NEED  TO  THINK  ABOUT  WHAT WE  NEED  TO  DO  TO  MAKE  SURE  OUR CITIES  ARE  NOT JUST PLACES  OF ECONOMIC  PROSPERITY AND  JOB CREATION ON  AVERAGE,  BUT DO  IT IN  A  WAY THAT  LISTS EVERYBODY UP TO  DEAL  WITH THE  OVERRIDING ISSUES OF INEQUALITY  AND  LACK  OF MOBILITY. THAT'S  WHY  I  THINK THIS CONVERSATION  IS SO  TIMELY  AND HOPEFULLY CATH  AND  OTHERS  WILL CONTINUE  TO  WORK  ON  THESE CHALLENGES.  >> THANK  YOU SO  MUCH,  SECRETARY CLINTON. BUILDING  OFF  OF YOUR REMARKS,  WE AT CAP  WORKED  A LITTLE  ON THIS ISSUE  AND  FOUND  THAT  THE  SIZE OF THE  MIDDLE-CLASS  ACTUALLY AFFECTS HOW MUCH  SOCIAL  MOBILITY YOU  HAVE  IN  THESE  METROPOLITAN AREAS. THAT'S  A REALLY  IMPORTANT  POINT. IN  THE 90'S, WE  SAW  ARTICLES ABOUT  HOW  CITIES WERE  DYING. SECRETARY  CLINTON REFERENCE THAT. NOW  THEY ARE  BEING  SEEN  AS  THE ENGINES  OF GROWTH. WHAT  ARE  THE STRATEGIES  THAT  YOU HAVE  SEEN  THAT  TALKING  ABOUT EARLIER,  YOU  HAVE  TO  BE  ABLE  TO DO  THAT. HILLARY  CLINTON: THIS  IS  EXACTLY ON  POINT. WE  HAVE FIVE  POINT  6 MILLION YOUNG  PEOPLE IN  AMERICA  BETWEEN 16  AND 24  WHO  ARE  NEITHER  IN SCHOOL  NOR AT  WORK. IF WE  DO  NOT  CONSCIOUSLY  TRY  TO SET UP  AT HER SYSTEMS TO  REACH OUT  AND FIND THESE  YOUNG  PEOPLE AND  TRAIN THEM,  WE  ARE  DOING SOMETHING  AT THE  CLINTON FOUNDATION  CALLED JOB  ONE, BECAUSE  A  LOT  OF  THEM  HAVE  NEVER HAD  A  JOB HE  FOUR. SO  THEY  DO NOT  HAVE  THE  HARD SKILLS BUT  THEY ALSO  DO  NOT  HAVE THE SOFT  SKILLS. PART  OF  THE CHALLENGES  WORKING WITH  COMPANIES  THAT  WILL DO EXACTLY  WHAT  YOU ARE SAYING,  AND THAT  IS TO  MAKE  IT  POSSIBLE  TO HAVE THESE  ENTRIES  ENTRY  POINTS.  -- THESE  ENTRY  POINTS. THE  OTHER  THING THAT  GERMANY DOES  IS INSTEAD  OF  AN UNEMPLOYMENT  SYSTEM,  THEY  HAVE A WAGE SUBSIDY SYSTEM. I  THINK  THERE  ARE  A LOT  OF CREATIVE IDEAS AND  BOTH COMPANIES  ARE  BEING  TRIED IN COMPARABLE ECONOMIES. WE  HAVE  TO  FOCUS ON  THE  FIRST JOB  AND  GET PEOPLE INTO  THAT SYSTEM  SO  THEY  CAN  MAYBE GET BETTER EDUCATED AND  BETTER OPPORTUNITIES  WILL COME.  >> WHAT  WE  OFTEN  DO  IS  TOP-DOWN RATHER  THAN  BOTTOM-UP  HERE  THE WHOLE  AND  ARGUE ONE ANOTHER. HILLARY  CLINTON:  AMEN. I LOVE  SESSIONS  LIKE THIS BECAUSE  IT  IS  NICE  TO  GET BACK TO  AN  EVIDENCE-BASED  DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT  WORKS  AND  WHAT  DOES NOT  WORK  AND  THEY TRY TO LEARN FROM  EXAMPLES  THAT  TEACH  US A LOT  OF  LESSONS. THAT  TO  ME IS  THE  MOST  IMPORTANT TAKE  AWAY. WE HAVE  CITIES  THAT ARE  WORKING WELL  BECAUSE THEY  HAVE  BEEN REINVENTING THEMSELVES AND  HAVE DONE  SO IN  A  COLLABORATIVE  AND INCLUSIVE MANNER. THEY  STILL  HAVE  WORK TO  DO. THEY ARE  AT  LEAST  DEMONSTRATING THERE ARE APPROACHES  THAT  WE  CAN LEARN FROM  AND  TRY  TO  APPLY. WE  HAVE OTHER  CITIES,  WHICH  WE KNOW ARE  HAVING  DIFFICULTY OVERCOMING  THE  CONTENTIOUSNESS, TRYING  TO  FIGURE  OUT  WAYS  TO COLLABORATE,  WHERE  IT IS  REALLY MORE  OF  A POLITICAL BATTLEFIELD THAN  A  POLICY DISCUSSION. I  HOPE  THAT  CAP  AND  THE  OTHERS REPRESENTED  HERE THIS MORNING AND DUE  TO GATHER  WHAT  IS  SO NEEDED,  AND THAT  IS TO  TRY  TO STIMULATE  A  CONVERSATION  IN CITIES THEMSELVES. I THINK  IT IS  BOTH  BOTTOM-UP AND TOP-DOWN. IF  WE COULD  GET MORE  CITIES GOING TO  STATE  CAPITALS  AND COMING HERE  TO WASHINGTON  AND SAYING, WE  NEED  TO  ABOLISH  THE SILOS,  WE  NEED YOUR  HELP  IN CREATING THE  CONDITIONS  FOR COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION, WE  NEED  TO  HAVE  YOUR HELP  IN CONVENING. THAT IS  SOMETHING SECRETARY CASTRO  IS  VERY  FOCUSED ON,  AND THEN  LOOKING  AT  WHAT WORKS  AND LOOKING  AT RESULTS  WHICH  I  THINK DIXON  HAS ALSO  REPORT --  ALSO POINTED  TO. LOOK AT  WHAT WORKS AND  GET  OUT OF  THE  VERY  UNPRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION  WE  HAVE HAD  FOR  TWO TEST  FOR  TOO  LONG, WHERE PEOPLE HAVE  BEEN AN IDEOLOGICAL BUNKERS,  HAVING ARGUMENTS INSTEAD  OF  TRYING  TO REACH ACROSS  DIVIDES AND  COME  UP  WITH SOLUTIONS. MAYOR,  I THINK  WHAT YOU DID  WITH GANGS  AND GANG  MEMBERS IS EXACTLY  WHAT  NEEDS  TO  BE  DONE IN SO  MANY  PLACES  IN  OUR  COUNTRIES.  -- DO  NOT  BE  SURPRISED  IF  YOU GET A  CALL. MAYBE  WE  WILL  START  NOT  TOO  FAR FROM  HERE.   IN A  BEAUTIFUL  DOMED BUILDING --  ","Urban Development, Economy, and Jobs"
