WE ARE GOING TO RENEGOTIATE  AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. STOP THE FLOW OF REFUGEES.  WITH CUSTOMS AND REGULATIONS  AND COMMON CORE COMMON GET  THEM NOW.  GET HIM OUT.  YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF NOW.  THERE IS ALWAYS ONE IN THE GROUP.  BUT YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE  VERY NICE.  WE WERE NOT KIND.  GET HIM OUT.  THANK YOU.   >> DID YOU GET HIM OUT?  THERE IS ALWAYS ONE.  THANKS TO THE POLICE VERY MUCH.  IS THERE ANY MORE FUN PLACE TO BE AND A DONALD TRUMP PROUDLY?  IS THERE NO SAFER PLACE AND  NO MORE ENERGETIC PLACE WITH  A LOT OF ENERGY.  FROM THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE  A LOT OF ENERGY.  GET IT CANNOT AS FAST AS YOU CAN.  LEE WILL BE PEELED AND REPLACE JOBS KILLING OBAMACARE.  YOUR JOBS WILL COME BACK  UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LIKE YOU HAVE  NEVER FEATURED -- NEVER SEEN BEFORE.  YOUR INCOMES WILL GO UP AND  YOUR TAXES WILL GO DOWN UNDER THE TRUMP MINISTRATIONS.  AND CROOKED HILLARY WANTS TO  RAISE YOUR TAXES JUST YOU UNDERSTAND.  THE COMPANIES WILL NOT BE LEAVING WISCONSIN.  BELIEVE ME THERE WOULD BE  CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE COMPANIES.  AND TO END GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION. HILLARY CLINTON IS THE MOST CORRUPT PERSON EVER TO RUN  THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES. KNEW LEVY LEAST FBI DOCUMENTS. EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS  EXACTLY WHAT WENT ON.  AND MADE PUBLIC JUST TODAY  HOW DEEP THE CORRUPTION GOES.  THE UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE  ILLEGALLY PRESSURED IN THE  FBI TO UNCLASSIFIED E-MAIL'S  OF HILLARY IS ILLEGAL SERVER . THAT IS A LOT OF ILLEGALITY  IN THE ONE STATEMENT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT WAS  TRYING TO COVER-UP FOR CRIME  OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE  TALKING ABOUT. THIS HAD HILLARY DELETING  AND BLEACHES 33,000 FEMALES -- E-MAIL'S.   GET THEM OUT.  THEN YOU HEAR OF VOICE THEN  YOU HAVE TO THOUSAND PEOPLE  BY THE WAY THAT IS ONLY A  SMALL PERCENTAGE.  BUT KEEP DOING IT.  IT IS MORE FUN THAT WAY.  THANK YOU.  YOU HAVE TO DISAPPEAR MANY  WERE HIT WITH A HAMMER.  WHO APPEAR HAS GOTTEN RID OF  YOUR PHONE AND HEADED WITH A  HAMMER? NOBODY?  I WANT TO FIND OUT THE  BUSINESS HE IS DID.  WHACKING DOWN WITH A HAMMER?  TWO BOXES OF THE BILL  EVIDENCE HAS GONE MISSING.  WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF LAPTOPS AND REMEMBER ALSO  THAT CRICKET HILLARY LIED  UNDER OATH TO SAY SHE HAS NEVER CENTER RECEIVED  CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.  AND SHE PRETENDED NOT TO  KNOW THAT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  SHE THEN TOLD THE FBI BAD MEMORY THEN IN THEIR WRITTEN TESTIMONY SHE COULD NOT  REMEMBER APPROXIMATELY 21 TIMES.  DOES ANYBODY BELIEVE THIS?  THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT MISSED JUSTICES.  WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE FBI IS SO BAD WITH SO MANY  INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.  THEY PROBABLY DON'T BELIEVE THEMSELVES. WE ARE WITNESSING A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE AT YOUR EXPENSE.  BUT IT GETS WORSE. THE FBI DOCUMENTS SHOW THE UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE FOR  ALTERING THE OF  CLASSIFICATION WITH THE QUID PRO QUO.  THIS IS A FELONY CORRUPTION BY ANY STANDARDS UNDER  SECRETARY KENNEDY THAT HE  ALSO RESIGNED.      >> I HAVE TO TELL YOU WE  HAVEN'T HAD ANY OF THIS  BERNIE SANDERS HAD MUCH MORE ENERGY. REALLY.  SO CLINTON AND HER CRONIES  HAVE SACRIFICED YOUR  FAMILY'S SAFETY AND YOUR COUNTRY'S SAFETY AS THOUGH  IT MEANT NOTHING TO HER AT ALL. THIS IN THE OPINION OF LAW-ENFORCEMENT THIS IS WORSE.  WHAT DOES SHE GET OUT OF IT?  THE RUN OF THE PRESIDENCY OF  THE UNITED STATES.  WE WILL PLAN AND END TO THAT  ON NOVEMBER 8.  WE WILL WIN.  NIPPLES ARE GREAT TODAY BUT  IT SHOWS THE UNDER CURRENT  THAT THEY CANNOT PULL.  REMEMBER THE PRIMARIES?  BILL LOOKS LIKE HE WILL NOT WIN.  THE NEXT DAY IT WAS A LANDSLIDE. WHAT HAPPENED? WE WILL TAKE IT ANYWAY. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SAY  THEY'RE VOTING FOR TRUMP.  WE WILL TAKE IT ANY WAY BE  CAN'T GET IT.  THE OTHER SERIES THE FEMALES  SHOW THEM SCHEMING TO TAKE  MASSES OF MONEY.  FROM THE TOP OF THE OFFICIAL SAY TAKE THE MONEY.  THIS IS BUNDLED AND IS  OBVIOUS ON BEHALF OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. REMEMBER WE ARE COMPETING AND I SAID IT REMEMBER THE  WE CNS?  HOW MANY DELEGATES DO I GET  BLACKS THEY SHOWED ME MY OPPONENTS.  I WENT THERE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT SO THEY SAY HOW MANY? THIS IS THE WAY THIS SYSTEM  WORKS THAT IT IS A RED SYSTEM.  BUT WE FIGURED IT OUT.  AND BERNIE SANDERS I BET HE  WISHED HE DID NOT ENDORSE HER.  SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN SPECIAL  IN HISTORY BUT WE WILL NOT  LET THAT HAPPEN TO WAS.  NOT WITH THIS MOVEMENT.  THE MEDIA TRIES TO RIG THE ELECTION BY GIVING CREDENCE  TO THE STORIES THAT HAVE VALIDITY. THEY TAKE A STORY WITH  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THAT DID  NOT EXIST TO PREVENT  FRONT-PAGE BECAUSE THEY WANT  TO POISON THE MINDS OF THE VOTERS.    >> TO POISON THE MIND FROM  30 YEARS AGO OR 20 YEARS AGO , BY THE WAY THOSE EVENTS  THAT NEVER HAPPENED.  IT IS AMAZING.  THAT IS WHY IN OUR FAVOR THE  BACKLASH SECOND NOBODY HAS  EVER SEEN BEFORE.  WITH FRONT-PAGE NEWS BUT IT  TURNS OUT IT IS SMALL STUFF.  THERE ISAAK BACKLASH FROM WISCONSIN. AND SAID WHAT TO THANK YOU.  NOBODY WHO HAS EVER RUN FOR OFFICE.  A VERY PROMINENT QUESTION.  AND MOST IMPORTANT FORMER  THIS WISCONSIN WHO GOT OUT  OF THE APOSTLE TO BE WITH US.  ONE OF THE GREATEST PEOPLE  WHO GOT OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.  IT IS AN AMAZING PERSON THINKS FOR BEING HERE.  WE HAVE OUR GENERALS AND OUR  SHARE OF.  AND HE WAS THERE EARLY WHEN HE WOULD ENDORSE TRUMP.  AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY.  THE MEDIA IS AN EXTENSION OF  THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AS WIKILEAKS HAS PROVEN BUT  THEY WON'T TALK ABOUT T11  THEY JUST KEEP TALKING ABOUT  DONALD TRUMP IN.  THEY HAVE TO START TALKING  ABOUT WIKILEAKS THEY HAVE TO START TALKING ABOUT THE  THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON.  THEN EVEN HAVE THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.   WE NEED SOME TRUTH.  TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN REDO NEED SOME TRUTH.  THEY POISONED THE MINDS OF VOTERS.  ALSO TO POISON THE MINDS OF  OTHERS. HILLARY EVEN GOT -- GET HIM OUT.  THAT'S OKAY.  THERE'S ALWAYS ONE ADDED TIME.   BY THE WAY WHERE IS THE I AM?  ONE OF THE GREAT SUCCESSFUL  PEOPLE SHE IS AMAZING. SHE HAS THE QUESTIONS AND  ANSWERS IN ADVANCE OF A  MAJOR DEBATE. HOW DO YOU DO THAT?  NOBODY EVEN KNOWS ABOUT THAT.  SHE GOT THE QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE. CAN YOU IMAGINE?  IF DONALD TRUMP GOT THE  QUESTION IS AN ADVANCE?  THEY WOULD REINVENTED THE ELECTRIC CHAIR. . . 96% OF SO-CALLED JOURNALISTS WHO  MAKE PRESIDENTIAL DONATIONS GAVE  THEIR MONEY COME GAVE THEMSELVES  COMIC IF YOU RETHINK YOUR  CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?  THEY EVEN WANT TO TRY TO RIG THE  ELECTION OF THE POLLING BOOTHS  AND BELIEVE ME THERE'S A LOT  GOING ON. DO YOU EVER HEAR THESE PEOPLE?  THEY SAY THERE'S NOTHING GOING  ON.  PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DIED 10 YEARS  AGO ARE STILL VOTING AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE VOTING.  WHERE ARE THE STREET SMARTS OF  SOME OF THESE POLITICIANS?  THEY DON'T HAVE ANY IS RIGHT.  SO MANY CITIES ARE CORRUPTED, VOTER FRAUD IS VERY VERY COMMON.  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION COMES  STRAIGHT FROM PEW RESEARCH.  QUOTE, APPROXIMATELY 24 MILLION  PEOPLE, ONE OF EVERY EIGHT VOTER  REGISTRATIONS IN THE UNITED  STATES ARE NO LONGER VALID OR SIGNIFICANTLY ENACTED.  ONE IN EIGHT.  MORE THAN 1.8 MILLION DECEASED  INDIVIDUALS RIGHT NOW ARE LISTED AS VOTERS.  IF THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR ME  WE WILL THINK ABOUT IT, RIGHT?  BUT I HAVE A FEELING THEY ARE  NOT GOING TO VOTE. OF THE 1.8 MILLION ARE VOTING  FOR SOMEBODY ELSE. APPROXIMATELY 2.75 MILLION  PEOPLE HAVE REGISTRATIONS IN  MORE THAN ONE STATE.  TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP. DO WE LOVE OUR POLICE? DO WE LOVE OUR POLICE FORCE?  THANK YOU, THANK YOU. YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE GETTING ANGRIER AND ANGRIER WITH EVERYONE.  THEY ARE SUCH A DISTURBANCE, YOU PEOPLE.  THEN THERE'S THE ISSUE OF  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS VOTING.  THE FOLLOWING COMES FROM A 2014  REPORT FROM THE ""WASHINGTON POST"".  THE ARTICLE WAS ENTITLED, COULD  NONCITIZENS DECIDE THE NOVEMBER ELECTION?  MORE THAN 14% OF NONCITIZENS IN 2008 AND 2000 SAMPLES INDICATED  THAT THEY WERE REGISTERED TO VOTE.  ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL?  BECAUSE NONCITIZENS TEND TO  FAVOR DEMOCRATS TO PUT IT MILDLY  OBAMA WON MORE THAN 80% OF THE  VOTES OF NONCITIZENS IN THE 2008 POLL.  YOU DON'T READ ABOUT THIS, RIGHT?  THEY DON'T TELL YOU ABOUT THIS.  YOUR POLITICIANS DON'T TELL YOU  ABOUT THIS WHEN THEY TELL YOU  HOW LEGITIMATE ALL OF THESE  ELECTIONS ARE.  THEY DO WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THIS.  IT WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO POSSIBLY  ACCOUNT FOR DEMOCRATIC VICTORS  IN CLOSE ELECTIONS.  NONCITIZEN VOTES COULD HAVE GIVEN DEMOCRATS THE PIVOTAL 60th VOTE NEEDED TO OVERCOME FILIBUSTERS IN ORDER TO PASS HEALTH CARE REFORM AND MANY  OTHER REFORMS AND OTHER OBAMA IT ILLUSTRATIONS PRIORITIES. IT CONTINUES.  IT'S POSSIBLE THAT NONCITIZEN  VOTES WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR  OBAMA'S 2008 VICTORY IN NORTH CAROLINA.  OBAMA WON THIS STATE BY 14,000 VOTES SO A TURNOUT BY 5.1% OF NORTH CAROLINA'S ADULT CITIZENS AND BY THE WAY WE ARE DOING  GREAT IN NORTH CAROLINA.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN THERE.  BUT WE DON'T WANT NONCITIZEN VOTERS.  IS THAT ALL RIGHT TO ASK?  IT COULD HAVE PROVIDED HIS  MARGIN OF VICTORY.  OUR SYSTEM IS ALSO RIGGED BY THE  DONORS GIVING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN AND I WILL  HAVE SPENT OVER $100 MILLION IN  MY CAMPAIGN.  I AM WORKING FOR YOU, FOLKS.  AND THEY ARE ALL TELLING ME WHAT  A GREAT JOB -- THERE'S NEVER  BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN THIS COUNTRY.  EVEN THE ENEMIES ADMITTED.  IF I DON'T WIN IT WILL BE THE GREATEST WASTE OF TIME AND ENERGY AND MONEY.  THEY SAY YOU WILL BE IN THE HISTORY BOOKS.  LET ME TIE YOU SOMETHING FOLKS,  I WANT TO WIN. IF WE WHEN WE WILL DO SOMETHING, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  THE REASON HILLARY CLINTON  PUSHES FOR JOB-KILLING NAFTA  TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP WHICH YOU CANNOT LET HAPPEN AND -- OH DON'T WORRY WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL.  BUILD THE WALL.   BUILD THAT WALL. BUILD THAT WALL.  >> WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL?  >> MEXICO.  >> 100%.  I'M NOT KIDDING, 100%.  ALL OF THESE PARTNERSHIPS WERE COMPLETELY OPEN BORDERS.  SHE WANTS OPEN BORDERS. SHE WANTS PEOPLE CLOSE OUR BORDERS.  HER INTERNATIONAL DONORS CONTROL  EVERY SINGLE MOVE SHE MAKES.  IF WE LET THE CLINTON CARTEL RUN THIS GOVERNMENT HISTORY WILL  RECORD THAT 2017 WAS THE YEAR  AMERICA LOST ITS INDEPENDENCE.  WE WILL NOT LET THAT HAPPEN.  IT IS TIME.  IT IS TIME TO DRAIN THE SWAMP AND WASHINGTON D.C..  THIS IS WHY I AM PROPOSING THE  PRACTICE OF ETHICS REFORM TO  MAKE OUR GOVERNMENT HONEST ONCE AGAIN. WHEN BILL CLINTON WHO WAS RIGHT  ABOUT OBAMACARE TWO WEEKS AGO BY THE WAY, IT'S CRAZY, CRAZY.  HE CAME INTO OFFICE AND SIGNED  AN EXECUTIVE ORDER SAYING IF YOU  WORK FOR THE WHITE HOUSE OR A  FEDERAL AGENCY YOU CAN'T LOBBY THE GOVERNMENT FOR FIVE YEARS.  BUT THEN PRESIDENT CLINTON DID  WITH THE CLINTONS ALWAYS DO. HE RIGGED THE SYSTEM ON HIS WAY OUT.  CLINTON LIFTED THE EXECUTIVE  EXECUTIVE ORDER SO CLINTON  CRONIES LIKE JOHN PODESTA COULD  START RAKING IN CASH.  SO HERE IS WHAT WE AS A GROUP  ARE ANNOUNCING TONIGHT.  FIRST, I'M GOING TO REINSTITUTE A FIVE-YEAR BAN ON ALL EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFFICIALS LOBBYING THE  GOVERNMENT FOR FIVE YEARS AFTER  THEY LEAVE GOVERNMENT.  I'M GOING TO ASK CONGRESS TO PUT  THIS INTO LAW SO IT CANNOT BE  LIFTED BY EXECUTIVE ORDER. RIGHT?  SECOND, I'M GOING TO ASK  CONGRESS TO INSTITUTE ITS OWN  FIVE-YEAR BAN ON LOBBYISTS BY  FORMER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND  THEIR STAFF.  THIRD, I AM GOING TO EXPAND THE  DEFINITION OF LOBBYIST SO WE  CLOSE ALL THE LOOPHOLES AND FORMER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS USE  BY LABELING THEMSELVES CONSULTANTS, ALL OF THESE  DIFFERENT THINGS AND THEY GET  AWAY WITH MURDER.  IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. FOURTH, I AM GOING TO ISSUE A  LIFETIME BAN AGAINST SENIOR  EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFFICIALS  LOBBYING ON BEHALF OF IF A  FOREIGN GOVERNMENT.  AND FIFTH, I'M GOING TO ASK  CONGRESS TO PASS A CAMPAIGN  FINANCE REFORM THAT PREVENTS  REGISTERED BORROWED LOBBYISTS FROM RAISING MONEY IN AMERICAN  ELECTIONS AND POLITICS.  THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY TO  ENDING OUR GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION  BUT WE WILL AND ECONOMIC STAGNATION ALSO AND THAT WILL HELP.  MY PLAN FOR THE ECONOMY CAN BE SUMMED UP IN THREE VERY BEAUTIFUL WORDS, JOBS, JOBS, JOBS.  JOBS.  THEY ARE TAKING OUR JOBS AWAY. THEY ARE GOING TO MEXICO AND  THEY ARE GOING ALL OVER THE  PLACE. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT.  THEY WANT TO LEAVE THERE WILL BE  CONSEQUENCES. YOU UNDERSTAND. AND THEY WON'T LEAVE WHEN THEY  HEAR THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES. BELIEVE ME, THEY ARE NOT LEAVING  IT'S SO EASY, SO EASY.  YOU WANT TO LEAVE ANY WANT TO  BUILD, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO  BUILD, CARS, IT CARRIER, SO MANY COMPANIES. YOU KNOW WE LOST 70,000  FACTORIES, 70,000 FACTORIES SINCE THE SIGNING OF NAFTA.  I THOUGHT IT WAS A TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR.  MIGHT BE 700, AND MAYBE 70,000.  AT THE CENTER OF MY JOBS PLAN WE  WILL BE FIXING OUR TERRIBLE  TRADE DEALS.  THEY ARE HORRIBLE.  47 MILLION AMERICANS ARE IN  POVERTY AND 45 MILLION AMERICANS ARE ON RIGHT NOW FOR -- WE HAVE NEARLY AN 800 MILLION-DOLLAR ANNUAL TRADE DEFICIT IN CAHOOTS  WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD AND  THE WORST SO-CALLED RECOVERY BY  FAR SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. DID YOU SEE THE JOBS NUMBERS THE  OTHER DAY? HORRIBLE.  YOU SAW OUR GDP IS GOING TO BE  IN MY OPINION LESS THAN 1%. YOU KNOW IF CHINA GOES TO 7%  FROM 8%, 9% IT'S A NATIONAL  CATASTROPHE. WE ARE LESS THAN 1% WHICH IS  WHAT IT WILL BE IT'S LIKE WHAT  ELSE IS NEW?  WE ARE NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH IT.  IF THE CLINTONS HE GAVE US NAFTA.  BILL CLINTON SIGNED THE WORST TRADE DEAL IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.  AND THE CLINTONS HE GAVE US  CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WORLD  TRADE ORGANIZATION. HERE IN WISCONSIN, DO WE LOVE WISCONSIN?  YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE. FIRST OF ALL I HAVE A LOT OF  FRIENDS HERE BUT YOU KNOW WHY  I'M HERE.  I'M HERE BECAUSE EVERYONE IS  CALLING ME.  EVERYONE IS CALLING SAYING WE  ARE GOING TO WIN WISCONSIN.  IS NOT SO TRADITIONAL, IT'S NOT SO TRADITIONAL FOR REPUBLICANS TO BE IN THIS POSITION.  MOSTLY THEY SAY WE WILL HAVE TO SKIP WISCONSIN.  NOT ME, WE ARE GOING TO WIN  WISCONSIN. COMPANIES LIKE BRIGGS & STRATTON WHO HAVE CUT THOUSANDS  MANUFACTURING JOBS AND MOVE THEM WHERE?  CHINA. GE HEALTH CARE RECENTLY CLOSED  ITS MILWAUKEE LOCATION AND SHIFT  THOSE JOBS TO MEXICO.  DO YOU KNOW THAT?  THAT'S A LOT OF JOBS THEY SHIPPED TO MEXICO.  JOBS SHUDDERED AND PLANTS IN  MILWAUKEE AND WEST ALLIS MOVE THE JOBS TO MEXICO AND MOVE THE  JOBS TO CHINA AND MOVE THE JOBS  ALL OVER THE PLACE EXCEPT FOR HERE.  THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. MANY COMPANIES LEAVING WISCONSIN, LEAVING EVERYWHERE. THEY ARE LEAVING OUR COUNTRY.  WE ARE LIVING THROUGH THE SINGLE GREATEST JOBS THEFT IN THE  HISTORY OF THE WORLD.  OUR COMPANIES ARE BEING RATED  AND OUR JOBS ARE LEAVING.  WE END UP WITH UNEMPLOYMENT AND  EMPTY BUILDINGS.  THEY END UP WITH CASH, DANDACH WITH CASH, TREMENDOUS FACTORIES LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN, MAGNIFICENT PLANTS, JOBS ALL  OVER THE PLACE.  WE END UP WITH TWO THINGS UNEMPLOYMENT.  THEY END UP WITH THE CASH AND WE  END UP WITH THE DRUGS.  A TRUMP TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS  GOING TO RENEGOTIATE NAFTA,  STAND UP TO CHINA AND GET ALONG  WITH CHINA.  WE DON'T GET ALONG WITH CHINA  NOW.  THEY RIP US OFF AND STOP THE JOBS FROM LEAVING OUR COUNTRY.  I HAVE THE LARGEST BANK IN THE  WORLD IS ONE OF MY TENANTS IN  MANHATTAN.  I WISH HER PEOPLE RAN OUR COUNTRY.  THEY ARE SMART PEOPLE.  WE DON'T HAVE SMART PEOPLE RUNNING OUR COUNTRY.  WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE INCOMPETENT.  WE HAVE A PRESIDENT, ALL HE  WANTS TO DO IS CAMPAIGN FOR HILLARY CLINTON SAID THAT SHE  CAN DOUBLE YOUR HEALTH CARE COSTS. ALL HE DOES IS CAMPAIGN. THIS GUY EVERY TIME YOU SEE HIM  HE IS CAMPAIGNING FOR CLINTON AND FRANKLY YET TO BE WORKING ON  JOBS AND HE OUGHT TO BE WORKING  ON THE 2ND AMENDMENT AND THE  BORDER AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS. HE OUGHT TO BE WORKING ON TAKING CARE OF OUR VETERANS.  AND OUR MILITARY.  HERE'S A GUY, WE GO INTO MOSUL  AND WHY DON'T WE JUST GOING QUIETLY?  IT USED TO BE CALLED A SNEAK ATTACK.  LET'S CALL THAT WE WANT TO DO IT  NICE AND EASY.  I'VE BEEN READING ABOUT IT FOR  FOUR MONTHS.  A PRIMARY REASON FOR GOING AND  WAS IT WANTED TO GET THE LEADERS OF ISIS, RIGHT?  THEY ARE GONE, FOLKS.  THEY ARE SMART PEOPLE.  THEY READ THE SAME NEWSPAPERS  AND ARTICLES THAT WE HAVE. OR THEY SAID HEY THEY ARE GOING  TO ATTACK MOSUL AND FOUR MONTHS, LET'S GET THE HECK OUT OF HERE.  THEY ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.  CAN YOU IMAGINE THE GREAT  GENERAL GEORGE PATTON AND  GENERAL MacARTHUR? YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING, RIGHT?  THEY ARE SPINNING IN THEIR GRAVES AND ICED TEA WE WILL BE  ATTACKING SOMETIME NEXT WEEK.  I HAVE BEEN READING ABOUT THIS  FOR MONTHS AND HONESTLY A BIG  PART I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD AND I  USED TO WONDER WHY THEY DIDN'T  GO IN.  I MEAN I QUIETLY, SURPRISE. REMEMBER THEY USED TO CALL IT  THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.  NOW OUR ELEMENT OF SURPRISE IS  IN FOUR MONTHS WE WILL BE ATTACKING MOSUL.  I WONDER WHAT OUR GENERAL THINK  ABOUT THAT. NOT TOO GOOD.  I WILL TELL YOU WITH THE -- GENERAL THINKS OF IT.  AS PART OF HER PLAN TO CREATE AT LEAST 25 MILLION JOBS IN 10  YEARS WE ARE GOING TO LOWER OUR  DISTANCE THAT 35% TO 15%.  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR NATION RICH AGAIN.  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE GREAT COMPANIES.  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE GREAT JOBS  AND JOBS ARE GOING TO START  COMING BACK TO AMERICA.  TO BE A RICH COUNTRY WE MUST  ALSO BE A SAFE COUNTRY.  NATIONAL SECURITY BEGINS AT THE  BORDER SPEAKING IN A SECRET  MEETING TO A FOREIGN BANK.  HILLARY CLINTON SAID HER DREAM  IS FOR A TOTALLY OPEN TRADE. THERE GO THE REST OF THE JOBS.  AND OPEN BORDERS.  THERE GOES YOUR COUNTRY. BETWEEN OPEN TRADE, JOBS, OPEN  BORDER YOUR COUNTRY YOU HAVE  LOST YOUR JOB AND YOUR COUNTRY. BY OPEN TRADE SHE MEANS FOREIGN COUNTRIES CAN CHEAT US OUT OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND MILLIONS OF JOBS AND LITERALLY NOT GOING  TO DOLLARS, REALLY IT'S  TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF JOBS.  BY OPEN BORDERS SHE MEANS  TOTALLY UNLIMITED IMMIGRATION. IN A SECRET SPEECH TO GOLDMAN  SACHS SHE SAID CITIZENS WHO WANT  TO CONTROL IMMIGRATION ARE UN-AMERICAN.  I DON'T THINK SO.  DEPLORABLE, RIGHT?  THE REDEEMABLE. IRREDEEMABLE. THESE ARE DEPLORABLE GUYS. HILLARY THINKS MOST OF THE COUNTRY IS EITHER DEPLORABLE OR AIR REDEEMABLE, UN-AMERICAN  RACIST OR BASEMENT DWELLERS. THAT'S WHAT SHE CALLS BERNIE SANDERS PEOPLE, BASEMENT DWELLERS.  BERNIE WHY DID YOU DO AT?  THOSE PEOPLE ARE SAYING WHY DID  YOU DO IT, BERNIE?  NOW HE HAS A RALLY AND 100  PEOPLE SHOW UP.  HE COULD HAVE LEFT A GREAT  MARKET HISTORY.  HILLARY'S PLAN INCLUDES ALTHOUGH  I THINK WE WILL GET A LOT OF  BERNIE PEOPLE BECAUSE ONE OF THE  THINGS BURNING NEW IS THAT WE  WERE BEING RIPPED OFF ON TRADE.  THE BIG FACTOR AND WE WILL HAVE  A LOT OF TRADE DID WE WILL HAVE  A DOUBLE HIGHWAY.  HILLARY'S PLAN INCLUDES OPEN  BORDERS WITH THE MIDDLE EAST LEADING GENERATIONS OF  RADICALISM AND TERRORISM  SPREADING AND GROWING WITHIN OUR SHORES. LET ME SAY THIS AS CLEARLY AS I CAN.  IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT I AM  GOING TO KEEP RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY.   USA, USA, USA.  HE WON'T EVEN USE THE TERM AND  NEITHER WILL SHE. WE WILL ALSO STOP THE CRISIS OF  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.  A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL SECURE AND DEFEND OUR BORDERS  AND YES WE WILL BUILD THE WALL  THAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT AND -- YOU KNOW WHEN WE GOT THE  ENDORSEMENT OF ALL OF THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS AND I.C.E. LAST WEEK, I.C.E. ENDORSE ME. I SAID TO THEM TELL ME ABOUT THE WALL.  WHO KNOWS BETTER THAN THESE  PEOPLE THAT WE NEED THE WHILE? WE ARE GOING TO STOP DRUGS FROM  POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY AND  POISONING OUR YOUTH.  THEY ARE POISONING OUR YOUTH AND  OTHER PEOPLE.  MANY OTHER PEOPLE.  BUT THEY ARE POISONING OUR YOUTH BEFORE OUR YOUTH GETS A CHANCE TO GO AND MAKE IT.  THEY ARE BEING POISONED BY THIS  GARBAGE POURING IN FROM THE  SOUTHERN BORDERS.  THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAVE A  CLINTON ALLOWED THOUSANDS OF  CRIMINAL ALIENS TO BE RELEASED BECAUSE THEIR HOME COUNTRIES WOULDN'T TAKE THEM BACK.  WE WOULD HAVE A MURDER, WE WOULD  HAVE A DRUG LAW AND GANG MEMBERS, WE WOULD BRING THEM  BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY.  THEY INTELLIGENTLY SAID WE DON'T  WANT THEM.  OUR GUY SAID OH YES AND HILLARY CLINTON NEVER FORCED THESE CRIMINALS BACK INTO THEIR OWN  COUNTRIES WHERE THEY BELONGED. I GUARANTEE YOU NOT ONE TIME AS  PRESIDENT WE SEE THAT HAPPEN, NOT ONE TIME.  THERE WILL BE NO TIMES AND WE  DON'T TAKE THESE PEOPLE AND PUT  THEM INTO THEIR COUNTRY FOR THAT  COUNTRY IS TELLING US TAKE THEM BACK.  WE DON'T WANT THAT MURDER. THE COUNTRY IS TAKING THE PEOPLE BACK.  YOU REMEMBER A LONG TIME AGO I SAID ENFORCING SOME IN THE  PEOPLE IN.  I'LL TELL YOU WE HAVE SOME  PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT ARE BAD NEWS. WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT AND BRINGING THEM BACK TO THE  COUNTRY THEY CAME FROM IN THE  COUNTRY IS GOING TO TAKE THEM.  THE I.C.E. OFFICE AND THEIR  ENDORSEMENT OF THE DESCRIBES HILLARY'S PROPOSAL IS QUOTE THE  MOST RADICAL IMMIGRATION  PROPOSAL IN UNITED STATES HISTORY.  HERE IS THE SUMMARY OF HILLARY'S PLANNED. SUPPORT TOTALLY FOR SANCTUARY CITIES.  SOME BAD, BAD PEOPLE ARE GETTING  SECURITY IN SANCTUARY CITIES.  SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE AND LIFETIME WELFARE FOR ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANTS BY MAKING THEM ALL CITIZENS.  AND IN MANY CASES THEY ARE BEING TREATED BETTER THAN OUR GREAT  VETERANS, REMEMBER THAT AND WE  ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW IT.  OBAMACARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS NO DEPORTATION OF VISA OVERSTAYS. EXPANDING CATCH AND RELEASE ON  THE BORDER.  YOU CATCH THEM, GO AHEAD, DO  WHATEVER WITH THEM.  IT'S CALLED CATCH AND RELEASE.  EXPANDING PRESIDENT OBAMA IS  UNCONSTITUTIONAL EXECUTIVE  AMNESTY INCLUDING INSTAWORK  PERMITS FOR MILLIONS OF ILLEGAL PEOPLE. BRINGING IN NON-ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVES AND A 550% INCREASE  IN SYRIAN REFUGEES TO COME INTO  THIS COUNTRY.  AND WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT AND  THAT'S OVER OBAMA'S NUMBERS.  EITHER WE WIN THIS ELECTION OR  WE LOSE OUR COUNTRY. I MEAN THAT.  I REALLY BELIEVE THIS IS THE  LAST TIME.  THIS IS THAT, FOLKS. THIS IS IT.  I REALLY BELIEVE THIS IS THE  LAST SHOT WE HAVE.  I FELT IT LAST TIME AND THIS  TIME I DON'T JUST FEEL IT, I KNOW IT.  UNDER A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION  IT'S GOING TO BE AMERICA FIRST.  AND BY THE WAY THAT'S THE MOST  BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL. HI.  LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL. HI.  DO YOU WANT TO COME UP AND SEE ME?  DO YOU WANT TO COME UP? , ON.  THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL. WOW.  SHE GOT ALL DECKED OUT FOR THIS EVENING. WOW.  SO BEAUTIFUL.

HERE ARE SOME OF THE AMAZING  THINGS WE ARE GOING TO DO FOR  OUR COUNTRY STARTING IN 2017.  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ONE OF THE  BIGGEST JOB PRODUCING TAX CUTS  IN AMERICAN HISTORY.  IT'S GOING TO BE AMAZING.  WE ARE GOING TO ELIMINATE EVERY  UNNECESSARY JOB-KILLING REGULATION. WE ARE GOING TO DEFEND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.  WE WILL PROVIDE SCHOOL CHOICE TO  EVERY LOW INCOME CHILD IN AMERICA. REBUILD OUR DEPLETED MILITARY  AND TAKE CARE OF OUR GREAT,  GREAT, GREAT VETERANS.  WE ARE GOING TO SUPPORT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.  WE WILL AGAIN REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE.  HERE IS ONE VERY IMPORTANT TO WISCONSIN. WE WILL SAVE OUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  WHICH IS UNDER SIEGE AND WE WILL APPOINT JUSTICES TO THE UNITED  STATES SUPREME COURT WHO WILL  UPHOLD AND DEFEND THE  CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.  YOU HAVE 22 DAYS TO MAKE EVERY  DREAM YOU HAVE EVER DREAMED FOR  YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY COME TRUE. ON NOVEMBER 8, THE ARROGANCE OF  WASHINGTON WILL COME  FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE RIGHTEOUS  VERDICT OF THE AMERICAN VOTER.  I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR EVERY  CITIZEN OF EVERY BACKGROUND FROM EVERY STRETCH OF THIS NATION.  I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR EVERY CHILD LIVING IN POVERTY. WE HAVE SO MUCH POVERTY IN THIS COUNTRY.  IT'S SO HARD TO BELIEVE. I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR EVERY MOM  WHO LOST THEIR CHILD THROUGH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION THROUGH  DRUGS AND GANG VIOLENCE. I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR EVERY COMMUNITY WHOSE JOBS AND DREAMS HAVE BEEN RIPPED OUT AND SHIPPED  TO OTHER COUNTRIES.  SO MANY.  I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR EVERY PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY WHO  BELIEVES GOVERNMENT SHOULD SERVE THE PEOPLE, NOT THE DONORS AND  SPECIAL INTERESTS.  I AM GOING TO FIGHT TO BRING US ALL TOGETHER AS AMERICANS. WE LIVE IN A VERY DIVIDED COUNTRY.  WE ARE NOT GOING TO LIVE IN A  DIVIDED COUNTRY MUCH LONGER.  THERE IS GOING TO BE SPIRIT. WE ARE GOING TO GET ALONG. IMAGINE WHAT OUR COUNTRY COULD  IF WE STARTED WORKING TOGETHER  AS ONE PEOPLE UNDER ONE GOD  SALUTING ONE AMERICAN FLAG.   USA, USA, USA.  >> BOY, I WILL TELL YOU WISCONSIN LOVES THIS COUNTRY.  YOU REALLY DO. PEOPLE ARE AMAZING, AMAZING.

YOUR INCOMES WILL GO UP UNDER A  TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. YOUR TAXES WILL GO AWAY, WAY  DOWN UNDER A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.  CROOKED HILLARY WILL LIFT YOUR  TAXES SUBSTANTIALLY. WAY  LET ME TELL YOU. RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE COMPANIES  OUT THERE THAT SOME OF YOU WORK FOR THAT ARE NEGOTIATING TO LEAVE OUR COUNTRY AND GO TO  MEXICO. YOU DO NOT KNOW IT, BUT YOU WILL  BE HEARING GET. IF I BECOME PRESIDENT THEN I AM  MOVING. WE ARE GOING TO BE A RICH COUNTRY AGAIN.  WE WILL END GOVERNMENT  CORRUPTION. HILLARY CLINTON IS THE MOST  CORRUPT PERSON EVER TO SEEK  OFFICE. YOU KNOW THIS. SHE IS THE MOST CORRUPT PERSON  EVER TO SEEK THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY. THE MEDIA, THE DONORS AND SPECIAL INTERESTS WHO SUPPORT  HER WILL DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN  TO CLING TO THEIR POWER AT YOUR EXPENSE.  YOU KNOW IT, I KNOW IT, THEY  KNOW IT. HILLARY CLINTON'S DOCUMENTS RELEASED BY WIKILEAKS MAKE MORE CLEAR THAN EVER, AND THEY DON'T  COVER THEM THE WAY THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO COVER THEM.  THAT IS BAD, BAD STUFF. JUST HOW MUCH IS AT STAKE IN  THIS ELECTION?  THE DOCUMENTS SHOW NEGOTIATING WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OVER  THE SERVER THAT IT'S YOUR COUNTRY AT DANGER. THEY SHOW THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN VICIOUSLY ATTACKING CATHOLICS AND EVANGELICALS THEY SHOW HOW THE MEDIA COLLABORATES AND CONSPIRES DIRECTLY WITH THE  CLINTON CAMPAIGN. BY THE WAY, THEY SHOW HOW THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN GETS QUESTIONS FOR THE DEBATE AND THE ANSWERS FOR THE DEBATE PRIOR TO THE DEBATE. WE STILL BEATS HURT EASILY -- BEAT HER EASILY IN THAT DEBATE. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?  SHE GOT THE QUESTIONS AND  ANSWERS PRIOR TO, I GUESS, THE BERNIE DEBATE. YOU DON'T EVEN HEAR ABOUT IT. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I GOT THE QUESTIONS IN THE DEBATE? IT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST STORY WORLDWIDE. YOU DO NOT EVEN HEAR ABOUT IT.  SHE GOT THE QUESTIONS BEFORE THE DEBATE TO COVER UP HER CRIMES. HILLARY CLINTON DELETED 33,000 E-MAILS AFTER. REMEMBER, NOT BEFORE.  THAT WOULD HAVE AN BAD. AFTER A CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENA. SO, SHE GETS THE SUBPOENA. WE HAVE PROBLEMS, GET RID OF THE E-MAILS, DELETE THEM. SHE LIED TO CONGRESS UNDER OATH. SHE MADE SOME IPHONES DISAPPEAR  WITH A HAMMER. ANYONE GET RID OF THEIR PHONE  WITH A HAMMER? THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE, I WANT TO  TALK TO THEM. TWO BOXES OF E-MAILS -- GONE. HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD HAVE AN PROSECUTED. SHE SHOULD WE IN JAIL, SHE SHOULD THE. -- SHOULD BE.  THE FBI AND THE  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CREATED  FRAUD IN ALLOWING HILLARY  CLINTON TO GET AWAY WITH HER  CRIMES. I GUARANTEE YOU THAT THE CLINTONS ARE LAUGHING LIKE HELP AT THEM RIGHT NOW. THE DIRECTOR'S PERFORMANCE IN  CONGRESS, COUPLED WITH BILL CLINTON'S MEETING ON THE CARMACK WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN HER  AIRPLANE JUST PRIOR TO DECISION TIME ON HILLARY CLINTON'S FUTURE SUPPOSEDLY TALKING ABOUT GOLF  AND GRANDCHILDREN FOR 39  MINUTES. REMEMBER, HE JUST HAPPENED TO BE  THERE. I LOVE ARIZONA, ONE OF MY  FAVORITE PLACES.  AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME OF THE  YEAR, IT WAS LIKE 110 DEGREES  OUT. THEY JUST HAPPEN TO BE, LOOK, I  WILL GIVE MY REGARDS TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A SITUATION LIKE THIS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THE FBI PEOPLE, WHO ARE PHENOMENAL PEOPLE, MUST BE SPINNING AT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE FBI. SPINNING. INSTEAD OF BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE, HILLARY IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AT WHAT LOOKS LIKE A RIGGED ELECTION. THE ELECTION IS BEING RIGGED BY CORRUPT MEDIA PUSHING COMPLETELY FALSE ALLEGATIONS AND OUTRIGHT LIES AND EFFORT TO ELECT HER  PRESIDENT. AND, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IN FACT, TODAY, THE COUSIN OF  ONE OF THESE PEOPLE --    IN FACT, THE COUSIN  OF ONE OF THESE PEOPLE WROTE A LETTER THAT WHAT SHE SAID IS A  LIE, THAT SHE WAS A HUGE FAN OF  DONALD TRUMP, SHE INVITED DONALD  TRUMP TO A RESTAURANT TO HAVE DINNER, WHICH, BY THE WAY, I DID NOT GO TO, I DID NOT KNOW WHO THE HECK WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE. THESE ALLEGATIONS HAVE AN, MANY  OF THEM, PROVEN FALSE.  THE BUTLER SAID IT WAS A TOTAL  LIE.  WE CANNOT LET THEM GET AWAY WITH THIS, FOLKS. TOTAL LIES. WE ARE GOING TO STOP IT.  WE ARE NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN. NO WITNESSES WHATSOEVER.  HOW ABOUT THIS CRAZY WOMAN ON THE AIRPLANE. CAN ANYONE BELIEVE THAT ONE? AFTER 15 MINUTES SHE SAID, THAT IS TOO MUCH. IN THIS PLACE, IT WOULD BE 15  SECONDS, AND SMACK. IT IS A CRAZY WORLD WE ARE  LIVING IN. IT IS A RIGGED ELECTION. THERE PUTTING THAT ON THE FIRST PAGES OF NEWSPAPERS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN. AMERICANS HAVE HAD IT WITH THE  YEARS AND DECADES OF CORRUPTION.  YOU CAN GO BACK TO WHITEWATER, TO THE CATTLE DEAL, WHERE SHE  GOT A FAR GREATER RETURN ON THE  INVESTMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE  CATTLE BUSINESS. GIVE ME A BREAK.  THESE ARE CROOKED PEOPLE. RIGHT NOW, SHE IS RESTING FOR  THE DEBATE. SHE CALLS IT DEBATE PREP. THIS IS SATURDAY.  THAT WILL BE WEDNESDAY. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW THIS STUFF. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO LEARN IN FIVE DAYS? YOU KNOW WHAT IS INTERESTING TO ME, SHE IS SUPPOSED TO KNOW IT, YET, WHEN SHE WAS BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI, WHAT SHE DID ON THE FOURTH OF JULY WEEKEND, BY THE WAY, WITH NO TAPE RECORDERS GOING, SHE DID  NOT HAVE TO SWEAR. THIS WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN  THEY TREATED MARTHA STEWART. NO TAPE REPOR RECORDERS GOING. 39 TIMES, I DON'T REMEMBER, I  DON'T REMEMBER. MAYBE THAT IS WHY SHE HAS TWO  DEBATE PREP BECAUSE SHE HAS A  BAD MEMORY. A LOT OF THINGS ARE GOING ON,  FOLKS. I THINK SHE IS ACTION GETTING PUMPED UP.  YOU UNDERSTAND? WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT IN  A FEW MINUTES.  SHE IS GETTING PUMPED UP FOR  WEDNESDAY NIGHT. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. WE LIKE ATHLETES, RIGHT? I BEAT 17 SENATORS, GOVERNORS  COME ALL THESE PEOPLE.  WE ARE LIKE ATHLETES. HILLARY BEAT BERNIE, THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN HE GOT A BIT OF A BAD DEAL, IF YOU LOOK AT  WIKILEAKS. ATHLETES, THEY MAKE THEM TAKE A DRUG TEST.  I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE A DRUG TEST PRIOR TO THE DEBATE. WHY DON'T WE DO THAT?  WE SHOULD TAKE A DRUG TEST PRIOR .  I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON WITH HER. AT THE BEGINNING OF HER LAST  DEBATE, SHE WAS ALL PUMPED UP AT THE BEGINNING.  AT THE END, IT WAS LIKE, TAKE ME DOWN, SHE COULD BARELY REACH HER  CAR. ANYWAY, I AM WILLING TO DO IT.  THESE PEOPLE GET RICH STEALING YOUR JOBS AND SHIPPING THEM TO OTHER COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE  WORLD. IN PARTICULAR, IN YOUR CASE, TO  MEXICO. I HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS IN NEW  ENGLAND, SO MANY GREAT FRIENDS  IN NEW ENGLAND, INCLUDING TOM BRADY AND COACH BELICHICK. HOW GOOD IS TOM? HE SAID, WELL, MAYBE 3-4 GUARDS,  THREE TOUCHDOWNS.  WHAT A GOOD COACH. A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE. THIS WILL FINALLY BE THE YEAR  WHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAY  ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. SPEAKING IN A SECRET MEETING TO  A FOREIGN BANK, HILLARY CLINTON SAID HER DREAM IS TO TOTALLY OPEN TRADE AND BORDERS.  THAT MEANS THE END OF YOUR JOBS. BY OPEN TRADE SHE MEANS FOREIGN  COUNTRIES CAN SHE AS OUT OF  MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF JOBS AND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THAT IS WHAT SHE MEANS. IT ALSO MEANS THE END OF THE JOBS THAT WERE TAKEN BY THE  DISASTER KNOWN AS NAFTA.  BY OPEN BORDERS SHE MEANS TOTALLY UNLIMITED IMMIGRATION. WHEN SHE THOUGHT NO ONE WAS LISTENING, HILLARY CLINTON WAS PLOTTING TO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF  THE UNITED STATES. EITHER WE WIN THIS ELECTION OR WE LOSE THIS COUNTRY. I REALLY BELIEVE THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE WE HAVE TO WIN. I REALLY BELIEVE IT. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN. A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL  SECURE AND DEFEND OUR BORDERS.  YES, WE WILL BUILD THE WALL.  A WALL WILL NOT ONLY KEEP OUT DANGEROUS CARTELS AND  CRIMINALS, BUT IT WILL KEEP OUT  THE DRUGS AND HEROINE THAT IS POISONING OUR YOUTH.  BY THE WAY, MEXICO, MAYBE THEY DON'T KNOW IT YET, MEXICO WILL  PAY FOR THE WALL 100%. THEY COULD BE HELPING US MUCH  MORE WITH THIS PROBLEM IF WE HAD  LEADERSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY THAT SAID, FOLKS, YOU BETTER HELP. THEY ARE KILLING US.  THEY WILL PAY FOR THE WALL IN SOME FORM. BELIEVE ME, THERE ARE ABOUT 12  FORMS THEY CAN DO IT.  THEY WILL PICK THE ONE THAT  LOOKS THE BEST.  THEY WILL PAY FOR IT. REMEMBER, DON'T FORGET, YOU WERE THE ONES. I WON NEW HAMPSHIRE, MY FIRST VICTORY. WHEN I WON THE PRIMARY, I PROMISED THE PEOPLE OF NEW  HAMPSHIRE THAT I WOULD STOP DRUGS FROM POURING INTO YOUR  COMMUNITY. YOU REMEMBER THAT? I SAID, I'M GOING TO DO IT. WITH THEM, IT IS JUST TALK AND TALK. THEY HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT  MAKE MONEY ON THE DRUG BUSINESS.  I WILL HAVE OVER $100 MILLION  SPENT ON MY CAMPAIGN.  PLUS, WE HAVE A LOT OF MONEY  COMING IN FROM SMALL DONORS. I ASKED HER THE OTHER NIGHT, WHY  DIDN'T YOU PUT SOMETHING INTO  YOUR CAMPAIGN? SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT.  TOO GREEDY. I'VE NOW DOUBLING DOWN ON MY  PROMISE TO THE PEOPLE OF NEW  HAMPSHIRE.  I CAN GUARANTEE YOU, WE WILL HELP ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE. WE WILL GET THEM ASSISTANCE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BETTER. I TELL YOU WHAT, I LOVE NEW  HAMPSHIRE. IT HAD BIG IMPACT ON ME. I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACES.  WHEN I GOT TO KNOW THE PEOPLE -- I MET WITH THE GROUPS AND SMALL GROUPS -- I SAID, WHAT IS THE  BIGGEST PROBLEM? THEY SAID, DRUGS. I SAID, DRUGS, IT DOESN'T WORK. IT MADE AN IMPRESSION.  I WENT FROM GROUP TO GROUP, WHAT  IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM? HEROIN, HEROINE.  YOU HAVE UNBELIEVABLE POLICE HERE.  THE LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS.  THEY ARE MEETING ME ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU HAVE UNBELIEVABLE LAW  ENFORCEMENT. IT IS A PRETTY DRAMATIC CAMPAIGN. HE DIS-HONOR TO HIS -- THIS HONORE DIS-HONORED HIS PLEDGE. I WOULD HAVE HONORED IT, NO MATTER WHO WON. THEY DISHONORED THEIR PLEDGE, NOT GOOD. I GOT TO KNOW THE COMMUNITY VERY  WELL.  I WILL TELL YOU, WILL THEY EVER  FORGET? IT WAS A ROUGH CAMPAIGN.  SOME OF THESE GUYS, SOME  GOVERNORS LOST MORE VICIOUSLY  AND IN A MORE BRUTAL CONTEST  THAN THEY EVER HAVE BEFORE.  I WAS A BUSINESS THAT WITH NO  EXPERIENCE. WHEN I WAS FOUR MONTHS INTO THE  CAMPAIGN, THEY DID A STUDY. THEY SAID, TRUMP HAD FOUR MONTHS OF EXPERIENCE. THEM, COMMUNITY DELETE -- SCHEMA TOPUMATHEY HAD OVER 230  YEARS. CHARLES HAMMER SAID, DONALD TRUMP HAS NO EXPERIENCE AND NO  CHANCE. REMEMBER WHEN, IN MASSACHUSETTS, I GOT ALMOST 50% OF THE VOTE WIT? 49.7%.  WE HAD LIKE 11 PEOPLE LEFT. THEY SAID, HE DID NOT GET 50%. THESE ARE TOTAL LOSERS.  BY THE WAY, MY PEOPLE TELL ME WE  ARE UP A LOT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. WHO KNOWS? I THINK WE ARE GOING TO WIN NEW HAMPSHIRE BIG. IT MADE A BIG IMPACT ON ME.  I GOT TO KNOW THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE SO WELL.  THEY DO NOT TALK ABOUT ALL THE  OTHER PROBLEMS WE HAD. THEY SAID IT WAS HEROINE POURING  INTO THE COMMUNITY. I SAID TO THEM, IF I WIN, I GET ELECTED PRESIDENT, I'M GOING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM.  I MEAN IT'S SO MUCH, MAYBE MORE  THAN EVER. YOU ARE THE ONES WHO REALLY  SHOWED ME THE GRAVITY OF THE PROBLEM, OF DRUGS, POURING IN,  MOSTLY FROM THE SOUTHERN BORDER INTO OUR COMMUNITY.  WE WILL TAKE CARE OF IT. NEW HAMPSHIRE IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST DRUG OVERDOSE RATES, IF  YOU LOOK AT IT, AND DEATH RATES IN THE COUNTRY.  IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE.  WE HAVE TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS.  WE WILL.  I HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO MY  RUNNING MATE, MIKE PENCE.  HAS HE BEEN GREAT? GREAT GUY. THE MANDATORY MINIMUM FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. HE HAS DONE SUCH A GOOD JOB IN  INDIANA. HE HAS BEEN SUCH A LOYAL FRIEND TO ME.  I APPRECIATE IT. HIS WIFE KAREN. THEN GREAT. THAT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.  LEADERSHIP IS ABOUT WHO YOU PICK . BY THE WAY, DID HE NOT THE HELL  OUT OF TIM KAINE?   THAT WAS LIKE THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS PLAYING MY HIGH  SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM.  WE MUST MAKE SIMILAR EFFORTS A  PRIORITY FOR OUR NATION.  NOT TOO LONG AGO, WE READ ABOUT CHRISTOPHER HONORED AND COURTNEY  GRIFFIN. A BEAUTIFUL COUPLE. WHO DIED OF AN OVERDOSE WITHIN  ONE YEAR OF EACH OTHER.  THEIR STORY OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, HEROIN, AND MISSED  OPPORTUNITIES IN THE COURT  SYSTEM IS WHY WE NEED TO PLAN TO END THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC.  WE HAVE SUCH AN EPIDEMIC IN THIS  COUNTRY. PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW IT.  THE PEOPLE WHO DO KNOW IT,  SOMETIMES IT IS TOO LATE.  WE HAVE TO AND THIS EPIDEMIC.  WE WILL STOP THE FLOW OF ILLEGAL DRUGS INTO OUR COUNTRY. THE NUMBER OF HEROIN SEIZURES ON  THE BOARD HAS TRIPLED.  IT HAS TO GO MUCH, MUCH HIGHER. I HAVE RECEIVED THE FIRST EVER ENDORSEMENT OF OUR BORDER PATROL AGENTS.  JUST LAST WEEK, OUR ICE OFFICERS . THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE, BY THE WAY, PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DO THE  JOB AND ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOBS. UNDER A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, WE  WILL WORK WITH THEM TO END THE  FLOW OF DRUGS ACROSS OUR BORDER. I ASKED THEM, HOW IMPORTANT IS A  WALL?  THEY SAID, SO IMPORTANT, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.  THAT MADE ME FEEL GOOD. WE WILL ALSO PUT AN END TO SANCTUARY CITIES, WHICH REFUSED TO TURN OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND REFUSED TO TURN OVER DRUG TRAFFICKERS FOR DEPORTATION.  WE WILL DISMANTLE -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DO THIS -- DISMANTLED THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CARTELS AND VIOLENT GANGS. WE WILL SEND THEM SWIFTLY OUT OF  OUR COUNTRY BACK TO THEIR  COUNTRIES, AND THEY ARE NOT  COMING BACK ANIN. IF YOU REMEMBER, HILLARY  CLINTON, WHEN WE BROUGHT  KILLERS, DRUG DEALERS, GANG  MEMBERS BACK, AND INTELLIGENTLY,  THE COUNTRY SAID, WE ARE NOT  TAKING THEM, WE DON'T WANT THEM.  SHE SAID, BRING THEM BACK. THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITH TRUMP, BELIEVE ME. THERE WILL NOT BE ONE CASE WHERE  THOSE PEOPLE ARE BROUGHT TO  THEIR COUNTRY AND BROUGHT BACK  TO OUR COUNTRY. NOT ONE CASE. WE WILL PROSECUTE TRAFFICKERS OF ILLEGAL DRUGS AND PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTORS WITH RESOURCES AND SUPPORT THEY NEED TO PROPERLY DO THEIR JOBS. PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHO SPENDS MOST  OF HIS TIME CAMPAIGNING FOR  CROOKED HILLARY -- THIS GUY SPENDS ALL HIS TIME CAMPAIGNING. HE OUGHT TO BE WORKING ON JOBS AND LOWERING TAXES. PRESIDENT OBAMA EXCOMMUNICATED THE SENTENCES OF HIGH-LEVEL DRUG  TRAFFICKERS. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? I MEAN, THE WHOLE THING,  HONESTLY, THE WHOLE THING IS  UNBELIEVABLE. SHE IS NOT WINNING BECAUSE  EVERYTHING SHE TOUCHES IS  TERRIBLE.  IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHY AM I NOT  UP THROUGH THE ROOF? HILLARY CLINTON, WHEN YOU LOOK  AT HER, LET LOOK AT HER,  EVERYTHING SHE TOUCHES TURNS  BAD. HER FOREIGN POLICIES ARE A  DISASTER. HER VIEWS ON THE BORDER ARE A  DISASTER. SHE WANTS TO EVERYONE FLOWING TO  THE COUNTRY. SHE WANTS SYRIAN REFUGEES  POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE OR  WHERE THEY COME FROM. SHE PROMISES TO EXPAND THIS  APPROACH, TURNING OUR STREETS  BACK OVER TO GANGS, DRUG CARTELS , AN ARMED CAREER CRIMINAL'S THAT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO GET OUT  OF THE COUNTRY. I WANT EVERYTHING TO BE LAW, JUSTICE, ORDER, AND EVERYTHING  PERFECT, BUT FOLKS, WE GOT TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK. WE GOT TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN STEADILY DISMANTLING THE FEDERAL, CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,  ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO HER. IT'S BEEN TOTALLY DISMANTLED. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, THERE HAS  NEVER BEEN A LOWER DAY IN THE HISTORY OF THE FBI OF THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN THIS PERIOD OF TIME. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DRUG DEALERS HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM PRISON, AND THEY HAVE BEEN RELEASED EARLY, INCLUDING MANY  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS REGARDLESS OF  THEIR HISTORY OF VIOLENCE OR TIES TO TRANSNATIONAL GANGS OR CARTELS. THEY ARE RELEASED EARLY ALL THE TIME.  THEY GET OFF FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR  AND WITHIN AN HOUR THEY ARE BACK DOING THEIR SAME THING. WE WILL CLOSE THE SHIPPING LOOPHOLES SENDING DANGEROUS DRUGS ACROSS OUR BORDERS AND  INTO THE HANDS OF OUR POSTAL SERVICE. THE TRAFFICKERS USE THE POSTAL  SERVICE TO MAIL DRUGS TO USERS  AND DEALERS ALL OVER THE UNITED  STATES.  IT COMES RIGHT THROUGH THE MAIL. THAT WON'T BE HAPPENING. THE TRUCK ADMINISTRATION WILL  CRACKDOWN ON THIS ABUSE AND GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT THE TOOLS THEY  NEED TO ACCOMPLISH THIS MISSION AND RAPIDLY. RAPIDLY.  THIRD -- WE WILL FIX THE  MISGUIDED RULES AND REGULATIONS  THAT HAVE MADE THIS PROBLEM WORSE. IT IS A TRAGEDY ENOUGH THAT SO  MANY AMERICANS ARE STRUGGLING  WITH LIFE-THREATENING ADDICTION. WE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH THEM. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM.  WE SHOULD NOT COMPOUND THAT  TRAGEDY WITH GOVERNMENT POLICIES  AND BUREAUCRATIC RULES THAT MAKE  IT EVEN HARDER FOR THEM TO GET THE HELP THAT THEY SO  DESPERATELY NEED. THE FDA HAS BEEN FAR TOO SLOW TO APPROVE ABUSE-DETERRING DRUGS. THEY HAVE DRUGS THAT CAN REALLY HELP, AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. FOUR YEARS AND YEARS THEY STUDY. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING IN COMMITTING SUICIDE. WE HAVE TO MOVE IT ALONG AND  THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE  AMAZING THAT THEY HAVE AND THEY  ARE NOT APPROVING THEM. WHEN THE FDA HAS APPROVED THESE  MEDICATIONS, THE RULES HAVE BEEN  FAR TOO RESTRICTIVE, SEVERELY LIMITING THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SUBSCRIBERS AND PATIENCE DOCTORS CAN TREAT. WE HAD MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF  PEOPLE AND OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE BADLY ADDICTED AND WILL DIE  SOON. WE HAVE TO MOVE IT ALONG. RECOVERY MEDICATIONS HAVE THE  POTENTIAL TO SAVE THOUSANDS AND  THOUSANDS OF LIVES. WE PRESCRIBE OPIOIDS LIKE OXYCONTIN. WE DO THAT FREELY, BUT WHEN PATIENTS BECOME ADDICTED TO  THOSE DRUGS, WE STOP DOCTORS FROM GETTING PATIENTS TO TREATMENTS THEY MEDICALLY NEED  TO GET BETTER. IT WILL HELP. IT WILL HELP. AND MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE  GOING TO BE DYING. WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG? YEARS AND YEARS. AS PRESIDENT, I WILL WORK TO LIFT THE CAP ON THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS THEY TREAT. THEY HAVE A CAP. AT THE SAME TIME, DEA TO REDUCE  THE AMOUNT OF SCHEDULED 2  OPIOIDS, DRUGS LIKE OXYCONTIN, METHADONE, AND FENTANYL. WE HAVE 5% OF THE WORLD'S  POPULATION, BUT USE 80% OF PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS. THAT'S AN AMAZING STATISTIC. FINALLY, WE WILL GIVE PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION ACCESS TO THE HELP THEY NEED.  CONGRESS HAS ARE RETAKEN THE FIRST STEP BY PASSING -- CONGRESS HAS ALREADY TAKEN THE  FIRST OF BYPASSING THE RECOVERY  ACT. THIS LEGISLATION IS AN IMPORTANT  STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I WILL EXPAND INCENTIVES FOR  STATES TO USE DRUG COURTS. YOUR POLICE HAVE DONE AN AMAZING JOB. THEY ARE AGAINST A FIGHT THAT IS  UNBELIEVABLE. YOUR POLICE HAVE DONE AN AMAZING JOB.  THEY CAN BE COST EFFECTIVE,  APPROPRIATE, AND HUMANE, AND THE RESPONSE TO THE ADDICTION CAN BE INCREDIBLE.  I WOULD DRAMATICALLY EXPAND  ACCESS TO TREATMENTS, AND AND  MEDICAID POLICIES THAT OBSTRUCT  INPATIENT TREATMENT. WE GOT TO DO THIS.  I WOULD DRAMATICALLY FIRST RESPONDERS' ACCESS TO NARCAN AND. IT IS AN ANTIDOTE THAT SAVE  THOUSANDS OF LIVES AND IS  SUPPOSEDLY AMAZING. THERE ARE AMAZING THINGS OUT  THERE, BUT WE ARE NOT GETTING --  THAT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO USE  THEM. TOO MANY OF OUR BRAVE VETERANS HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED THESE DANGEROUS AND PRESCRIPTION  DRUGS. THE V.A. HAS BEEN SUCH A  DISASTER ALL OF THE COUNTRY AND  WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS BETTER THAN THEY HAD  BEEN TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE. REMEMBER THAT.  OUR VETERANS, IN MANY CASES, ARE  NOT TREATED AS WELL. REMEMBER THIS -- THEY ARE NOT TREATED AS WELL AS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO COME POURING INTO  THE COUNTRY. OUR VETERANS ARE GOING TO BE  TAKEN CARE OF REALLY WELL FOR  THE FIRST TIME. THESE ARE OUR GREAT PEOPLE.  TOGETHER, THESE STEPS WILL ENSURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION HAS ACCESS TO THE CARE AND THE HELP  HE OR SHE NEEDS. IN MOST CASES, AND IN SOME  CASES, DESPERATELY NEEDS. IF WE ARE GOING TO BRING HOPE  BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES, WE  ONLY HAVE TO SOLVE LOTS OF PROBLEMS, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO  SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT WE HAVE  BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC CRISIS. JOBS ARE GONE. OUR COMPANIES, A LOT OF THEM  HAVE LEFT. A LOT OF OUR BEST COMPANIES HAVE  LEFT. LEAVING BEHIND DILAPIDATED COMMUNITIES, RUSTED OUT FACTORY, AND SHATTERED DREAMS. WE DRIVE AROUND HERE AND YOU SEE  BUILDINGS THAT WERE THRIVING 20  YEARS AGO, AND NOW THOSE  COMPANIES ARE LOCATED IN MEXICO  AND OTHER PLACES. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, FOLKS.  AT THE CENTER OF OUR ECONOMIC REVIVAL, THE WILL BE FIXING OUR  TERRIBLE TRADE DEALS. JUST TERRIBLE. YOU LOOK AT NAFTA, YOU LOOK AT  WHAT'S HAPPENED. SPEAKING OF THAT, 47 MILLION  AMERICANS ARE LIVING IN POVERTY. 45 MILLION AMERICANS ARE ON FOOD  STAMPS. THINK OF THAT, IN THIS COUNTRY.  WE HAVE NEARLY AN $80 BILLION TRADE DEFICIT IN GOODS IN THE WORLD SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. IT IS NOT A RECOVERY. IT IS ONLY A RECOVERY AND WALL  STREET BECAUSE IT IS A BIG FAT  BUBBLE THAT WILL EXPLODE AS SOON  AS INTEREST RATES GO UP. AND OBAMA DOES NOT WANT TO  RAISING INTEREST RATES BECAUSE  HE DOES NOT WANT TO GO DOWN THE  WAY HE SHOULD GO DOWN. IT IS A BIG FAT, UGLY BUBBLE. YOU WATCH. IT IS HORRIBLE. IT IS HORRIBLE THAT HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH THIS.  AND HE HAS DOUBLED THE DEBT OVER  HIS SHORT TENURE. OVER EIGHT YEARS, HE WOULD HAVE DOUBLED THE DEBT TO $20  TRILLION. FROM 10 TRAIN DOLLARS TO -- FROM $10 TRILLION TO $20. TRILLION DOLLARS. . WE HAVE NOT EVEN STARTED YET. OUR AIRPORTS ARE A LAUGHINGSTOCK  ALL OVER THE WORLD.  THIS IS THE LEGACY OF  OBAMA-CLINTON. SUSTAINABLE -- THE STATE OF NEW  HAMPSHIRE HAS LOST MANUFACTURING JOBS SINCE NAFTA. SINCE CHINA INTO THE WORLD TRADE  ORGANIZATION, ANOTHER BILL HILLARY BACKED, AND THIS IS A  BILL CLINTON DEAL ALSO COME AND  LISTEN TO THIS BECAUSE I THOUGHT  THIS WAS A MISTAKE. 70,000 FACTORIES HAVE SHUT DOWN, OR LEFT THE HEAD OF STATES. 70,000. MILLIONS OF JOBS. I WENT BACK TO MY PEOPLE AND  SAID, YOU MADE A TYPO. IT COULDN'T BE 70,000 FACTORIES. SADLY, IT WAS NOT A TYPO. THAT IS 15 FACTORIES AT A  CLOSING ON AVERAGE.  15 A DAY. BUT 15 FACTORIES. WE ARE LIVING THROUGH THE GREATEST JOBS' THEFT IN THE  HISTORY OF THE WORLD. NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE  WORLD HAS THERE BEEN A THEFT OF JOBS LIKE WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DONE TO THE UNITED STATES. YOUR AREA HERE, JUST ABOUT THE  TOP-OF-THE-LINE, YOU UNDERSTAND  THAT. THERE SHE GOES, SHE SAYS, NO  GETTING. THEY KNOW, YOU KNOW. TOKYO, FEED CHRYSLER, MATTEL, HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS ARE MOVING  THEIR JOBS TO MEXICO. I AM TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW,  COMPANIES ARE NEGOTIATING FROM  THIS AREA TO MOVE TO MEXICO. NOT PRETTY. WON'T HAPPEN -- IF I AM ELECTED,  IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN  BECAUSE THEY WILL KNOW THAT IF  THEY GO TO MEXICO AND THEY BUILT  THEIR PRODUCT IN MEXICO IN ONE  TO SELL IT INTO THE UNITED STATES, AND THEY ARE GOING TO FIRE ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WHETHER  IT IS NEW HAMPSHIRE OR ANYWHERE ELSE, THEY ARE GOING TO PAY A 35% TAX ON THAT PRODUCT COMING BACK IN AND THEY ARE NOT GOING  TO MOVE. NO CHANCE OF THEM MOVING.  YOU KNOW WHAT? I HAVE BEEN WATCHING FOR 10 YEARS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THEY  GIVEN ZERO INTEREST LOANS AND  GIVE THEM ALL SORTS OF THINGS.  WHEN YOU TELL THEM THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES TO PAY WHEN YOU FIRE PEOPLE FROM THIS AREA, OR ANY AREA IN THE UNITED STATES,  AND YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO  MOVE SOMEWHERE AND MAKE PRODUCT  AND SELL IT TO US. ? NO. NO. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE THE  STUPID PEOPLE ANYMORE. I VISITED THE SYLVANIA PLANT. DOES ANYBODY MAKE A TELEVISION  SET IN THE UNITED STATES?  WE DON'T MAKE ANYTHING ANYMORE. I BUY THOUSANDS OF TELEVISION  SETS AGAIN. EVERYTHING IS SOUTH KOREA, RIGHT? YOU HAVE ALL SOUTH KOREA. LG, EVERYTHING. CAN WE FIND SOMEBODY IN THE UNITED STATES? YOU SEE THAN INSULTING A HAVE  NOT SEEN THAT NAME AND A LONG  TIME BECAUSE THEY MOVED.  THEY CLOSE THEIR DOORS AND 2017 -- IN 2014 AND MOVED THEIR JOBS  TO MEXICO. YOUR JOBS ARE DONE.  THEY ARE GONE. IF I WIN, DAY ONE, WE WILL  ANNOUNCE OUR PLANS TO TOTALLY RENEGOTIATE NAFTA.  IF WE DON'T GET THE DEAL B-1S, WE WILL LEAVE NAFTA AND START  OVER AGAIN AND WE WILL MAKE MUCH  BETTER TRADE DEALS. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE GOOD TRADE DEALS. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TRADE DEALS  WITH JOBS COMING INTO OUR  COUNTRY. WE WILL HAVE TWO MAIN HIGHWAYS, NOT ONE. RIGHT NOW, OUR TRADE DEAL, NAFTA -- BY THE WAY, THE WORST TRADE DEAL EVER MADE IN THE WORLD. IF YOU LOOK AT THE TAX SYSTEMS,  THEY ARE DIFFERENT. IMMEDIATELY -- WHEN THE DEAL WAS  MADE, THEY MADE A MISTAKE AND  NOBODY EVER FIXED THE MISTAKE. THEY STARTED OFF WITH A 16 PERCENT ADVANTAGE. THEY MADE A MISTAKE. IT IS A DEFECTIVE DEAL. HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE DEALS GOING  THE OTHER WAY? THEY ARE ALL GOING TO MEXICO. IT IS BETTER THAN HIRING A CONSULTANT. A FRIEND OF MINE, I SET OUT HIS BUSINESS -- I SAID HOW IS  BUSINESS? WHERE ARE YOU BUILDING? HE SAID MEXICO. HE IS FROM UNITED STATES. I SAID, HOW WAS MEXICO DOING? HE SAID, DONALD, IT IS THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD AND  WE ARE BUILDING SOME OF THE GREATEST PLANTS IN MEXICO.  YOU HAVE TO SEE.  I SAID, I DON'T WANT TO SEE.  SO MANY COMPANIES ARE MOVING  THEIR NOW. HOW ABOUT THE UNITED STATES? HE SAID, NOT GOOD, NOT GOOD. HOW STUPID ARE WE? HOW STUPID ARE OUR LEADERS? IT IS CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS, PACTS, ALL OF THIS STUFF. EVEN IF THEY KNOW BETTER, AND THEY ARE NOT ALL STUPID, A LOT OF THEM ARE, BUT THEY WON'T DO IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO CARE OF  THEIR DONORS FOR SPECIAL INTERESTS. I TELL YOU THIS VERY STRONGLY,  TO ME, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STATEMENTS, WE ARE GOING TO  START MAKING THINGS AGAIN IN  AMERICA.  YOU ARE GOING TO SEE THE DAY  DURING MY TERM THAT APPLE OPENS UP IN THIS COUNTRY AND APPLE AND OTHER COMPANIES LIKE APPLE MAKE  THEIR PRODUCT IN THIS COUNTRY. FORGET ABOUT CHINA, FORGET ABOUT --   REMEMBER THIS, WITH ME, IT IS  AMERICA FIRST. AMERICA FIRST. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE GOOD  RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEXICO. I MET WITH THE PRESIDENT OF  MEXICO TWO MONTHS AGO. I AM SURE YOU READ ABOUT IT.  HE IS A NICE GUY. HE IS A VERY NICE GUY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH MEXICO, BUT WE  HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO MEXICO, IT IS  A TWO-WAY STREET, NOT A ONE-WAY  STREET. IT HAS GOT TO COME BOTH WAYS. WE GET THE DRUGS, THE UNEMPLOYMENT. THEY GET THE CASH, THE  COMPANIES, AND THE JOBS. I WOULD SAY THAT IS NOT A GOOD  DEAL, DON'T YOU THINK? WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BE AMERICA FIRST AND WE ARE GOING TO SEE APPLE ANOTHER COMPANIES LIKE APPLE OPENING PLANTS IN THIS  COUNTRY. BELIEVE ME, IT IS GOING TO  HAPPEN. IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AS SURE AS  YOU ARE STANDING THERE, THAT IS  GOING TO HAPPEN. AS PART OF THE PLAN TO BRING  BACK JOBS, WE ARE GOING TO LOWER  OUR BUSINESS TAX FROM 35% TO TWO  15%. -- TO 15%. BRINGING TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS  OF DOLLARS IN WEALTH BACK INTO  OUR COUNTRY. YOU HAVE MANY COMPANIES LEAVING  OUR COUNTRY TO GET THEIR MONEY. THE TAXES ARE SO HIGH AND BUREAUCRACY IS EVEN WORSE. MANUFACTURERS WILL BE ABLE TO  EXPENSE THE COST OF NEW  INVESTMENT AND EQUIPMENT TO HELP MAKE OUR COUNTRY MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT  EVEN COMPETITIVE NOW.  WE ARE THE HIGHEST TAX MAJOR  COUNTRY IN ANY WHERE IN THE WORLD BY FAR. WE ARE GOING TO BE ONE OF THE  LOWER TAX. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THE LOWEST, BUT WE WON'T BE, BUT WILL BE ONE  OF THE LOWER TAX IN THE WORLD. WE WILL LOWER TAXES MASSIVELY. HILLARY IS LOOKING TO RAISE YOUR TAXES MASSIVELY, MASSIVELY. WE WILL BECOME THE GREAT JOBS MAGNET OF THE WORLD. WAGES WILL RISE. JOBS WILL RETURN. THE FACTORY SET I TOLD HER ABOUT  WILL COME RUSHING BACK ONTO OUR SHORES.  JUST TO FINISH UP, HERE ARE SOME  OF THE AMAZING THINGS WE ARE  GOING TO DO FOR OUR COUNTRY  STARTING IN 2017. AND REMEMBER, IT ONLY WORKS NOVEMBER 8, YOU GOT TO GET OUT,  YOU GOT TO VOTE.  YOU GOT TO VOTE.  I JOKINGLY SAY IF YOU GO TO YOUR DOCTOR AND YOU GET A PROGNOSIS,  THAT IS THE ULTIMATE. HE SAYS IT IS OVER. YOU HAVE A MONTH TO LIVE. DOES NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE. ON NOVEMBER 8, YOU GET OUT OF BED, YOU GET OUT -- THINK OF  YOUR CHILDREN, THINK OF YOUR GRANDCHILDREN. YOU GOT TO GET OUT AND VOTE.  YOU GOT TO GET OUT. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE BIGGEST TAX CUT SINCE RONALD REAGAN. ACTUALLY, IT CAN EVEN BE BIGGER  THAN THAT. VERY IMPORTANTLY, WE ARE GOING TO ELIMINATE EVERY UNNECESSARY REGULATION THAT ARE CHOKING PEOPLE IN CHOKING OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO DEFEND OUR  RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.  WE ARE GOING TO REDUCE THE COST OF COLLEGE TUITION.  WE ARE GOING TO REBUILD FOR OUR GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE AND THE MILITARY, WE ARE GOING TO  REBUILD OUR DEPLETED MILITARY, AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF  OUR VETERANS.  WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL AND  REPLACE OBAMACARE.  VERY IMPORTANT FOR NEW  HAMPSHIRE, THIS IS UNDER SIEGE. WE ARE GOING TO SAVE OUR SECOND AMENDMENT.  AND THE NATIONAL RIFLE  ASSOCIATION ENDORSED ME, THEY ARE TERRIFIC PEOPLE. WE ARE GOING TO APPOINT JUSTICES TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WHO WELL UPHOLD AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED  STATES.  YOU HAVE 24 DAYS TO MAKE EVERY DREAM YOU EVER DREAMED FOR YOUR  FAMILY, FOR YOUR COUNTRY. 24 DAYS. IF WE DON'T WIN, AS I SAID BEFORE, I DON'T THINK IT IS EVER  GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN. OUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE IN A  SPIRAL THAT WON'T BE STOPPED. ON NOVEMBER 8, THE ARROGANCE OF WASHINGTON D.C. WILL COME  FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE RIGHTEOUS VERDICT OF THE AMERICAN VOTER.  I AM GOING TO FIGHT SO HARD TIERED HEY, I HAD A GREAT LIFE. I GOT THE BEST OF THE CITY. IDLE THIS INCREDIBLE COMPANY.  MY LIFE IS SO WONDERFUL. I AM LOVING THIS BECAUSE WE ARE  DOING THIS THAT IS GOING TO BE  SO AMAZING, BUT WE HAVE TO PULL  IT OFF. IT IS A MOVEMENT TO THE LIKES OF  WHICH THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN  BEFORE. LOOK AT THIS CROWD ALL THE WAY BACK. THE LIKES OF WHICH THEY HAVE  NEVER SEEN BEFORE.  I AM GOING TO FIGHT FOR EVERY  CITIZEN OF EVERY BACKGROUND FROM EVERY STRETCH OF THIS NATION,  AND I AM GOING TO FIGHT TO BRING US ALL TOGETHER AS AMERICANS.

[CHEERS AND  THE CORRUPT ESTABLISHMENT KNOWS THAT WE ARE A GREAT THREAT TO THEIR CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE. THEY KNOW THAT IF WE WIN THEIR POWER IS GONE, AND IT IS  RETURNED TO YOU THE PEOPLE. THE DARK CLOUDS HANGING OVER OUR GOVERNMENT WILL BE LIFTED AND  REPLACED WITH A BRIGHT FUTURE,  BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHETHER WE LET THE CORRUPT MEDIA DECIDE OUR  FUTURE, OR WHETHER WE LET THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE DECIDE OUR  FUTURE.   IF THIS CLINTON  CAMPAIGN OF DESTRUCTION IS  ALLOWED TO WORK, THEN NO OTHER HIGHLY -- AND THIS IS SO TRUE, I  HAVE SEEN THIS SO MANY TIMES,  AND I HAVE HEARD THIS ALL OF MY LIFE -- IF WE LET THIS HAPPEN, THEN NO OTHER HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL PERSON, WHICH IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR TRADE  DEALS, WHICH ARE SO BAD.  AND YOU LOOK AT TRADE, WE ARE  GOING TO LOSE ALMOST $800  BILLION THIS YEAR. ALMOST $800 BILLION. OUR DEBT HAS DOUBLED IN SEVEN  AND A HALF YEARS TO ALMOST $20  TRILLION UNDER OBAMA.   NO OTHER SUCCESSFUL PERSON, AFTER WATCHING THIS,  WILL EVER AGAIN, EVER -- AND WHO  CAN BLAME THEM?  EVEN ME, I WOULD SAY YOU ARE  RIGHT. WILL EVER AGAIN RUN FOR OFFICE.  I HAVE HEARD IT FOR YEARS. IF YOU ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL, YOU  CAN'T RUN FOR HIGH OFFICE. I SAID I DON'T CARE.  I HAVE DONE SO WELL. IT IS A CERTAIN MINDSET WE NEED  IN OUR COUNTRY, AT LEAST FOR A  PERIOD OF TIME.  WE HAVE TO STRENGTHEN OUR  COUNTRY OUT.   I WILL NOT LIE TO YOU . THESE FALSE ATTACKS ARE ABSOLUTELY HURTFUL. TO BE LIED ABOUT, TO BE SLANDERED, TO BE SNARED SO PUBLICLY, AND BEFORE YOUR FAMILY  THAT YOU LOVE, IS VERY PAINFUL. WHAT IS GOING ON IS EGREGIOUS THE ON ANY WORTH -- EGREGIOUS BEYOND ANY WORTH.  PEOPLE THAT KNOW THE FACTS, THEY  CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT. IT IS REPREHENSIBLE BEYOND  DESCRIPTION.  IT IS TOTALLY CORRUPT.  BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT IT IS NOT  ABOUT ME. IT IS ABOUT ALL OF YOU AND ABOUT  OUR COUNTRY.  I KNOW THAT. I FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT'S WHY I GOT INVOLVED. IT IS ABOUT ALL OF US TOGETHER AS A COUNTRY. IT IS A MOVEMENT THE LIKES OF  WHICH WE HAVE NEVER IN HISTORY SEEN BEFORE, NEVER IN HISTORY. EVEN THE PUNDITS, EVEN THE MEDIA  THAT TRULY DISLIKES DONALD TRUMP  FOR THEIR OWN REASONS WILL ADMIT THIS IS A MOVEMENT OF THE LIKES OF WHICH WE HAVE NEVER SEEN  BEFORE.  AND IT IS A MOVEMENT ABOUT THE VETERANS WHO NEED MEDICAL CARE. [CHEERS AND  THE MOTHERS WHO LOST THEIR BELOVED CHILDREN TO  TERRORISM AND CRIME. IT IS ABOUT THE INNER CITIES,  WHO DESPERATELY NEED OUR HELP.  IT IS ABOUT THE MILLIONS OF  JOBLESS PEOPLE IN AMERICA.  IT IS ABOUT THE AMERICAN WORKERS  WHO CAN'T GET JOBS BECAUSE OUR  JOBS HAVE LEFT FOR MEXICO AND SO  MANY OTHER COUNTRIES.   THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE GETTING CRUSHED BY OBAMACARE.  AND IT IS ABOUT DEFEATING ISIS, AND APPOINTING A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. IT COULD BE FOUR OR FIVE. WHO WOULD PROTECT OUR  CONSTITUTION.   THIS ELECTION IS ALSO  ABOUT, SO IMPORTANTLY TO ME, AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC-AMERICAN PEOPLE WHOSE COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN PLUNGED INTO CRIME, POVERTY, AND FAILING SCHOOLS BY THE POLICIES OF  CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON, BELIEVE ME.  SHE IS CROOKED.   THEY HAVE ROBBED THESE CITIZENS OF THEIR FUTURE,  AND IF WE WIN, I WILL GIVE THEM  THEIR HOPES, THEIR JOBS, THEIR  EDUCATION. I WILL GIVE THEM THEIR SECURITY. THE INNER CITIES, EDUCATION IS  ALMOST WORTHLESS. IT'S HORRIBLE. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE COMMON CORE ENDED.  WE ARE GOING TO BRING EDUCATION LOCAL.   BUT YOU LOOK AT THE INNER CITIES, AND YOU SEE BAD  EDUCATION, NO JOBS, NO SAFETY. YOU WANT TO THE GROCERY STORE  WITH YOUR CHILD AND YOU GET SHOT.  YOU WALK OUTSIDE TO LOOK AND SEE  WHAT'S HAPPENING AND YOU GET  SHOT.  IN CHICAGO, 3000 PEOPLE HAVE  BEEN SHOT SINCE JANUARY 1. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THAT  HAPPEN.  OUR INNER CITIES ARE ALMOST AT  AN ALL-TIME LOW, RUN BY THE DEMOCRATS FOR SOMETIMES MORE  THAN 100 YEARS CHAIN UNBROKEN. SO THEY HAVE NO JOBS.  THEY HAVE HORRIBLE EDUCATION. THEY HAVE NO SAFETY AND  SECURITY. I SAY TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU  HAVE TO LOSE? I WILL FIX IT.  I WILL MAKE IT GOOD.  I WILL BRING BACK OUR JOBS. WE WILL HAVE GOOD EDUCATION.  WE WILL HAVE GREAT SAFETY IN THE  INNER CITY.   AND WE WILL HELP THE  HISPANIC AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO  HAVE BEEN TREATED SO BADLY AND SO UNFAIRLY IN OUR NATION.  WE WILL HELP THEM.   I WILL DELIVER LIKE  YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.  I DELIVER. WHETHER PEOPLE LIKE DONALD TRUMP  OR NOT, THEY ALL SAY HE  DELIVERS.   VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP, AND YOU WILL BE SO HAPPY, SO THRILLED. THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT EVERY  MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD IN OUR  COUNTRY WHO DESERVES TO LIVE IN  SAFETY, PROSPERITY, AND PEACE.  SO TRUE. WE WILL RISE ABOVE THE LIES, THE SMEARS, BUT LOOTED -- THE LUDICROUS SLANDERERS FROM LUDICROUS AND VERY DISHONEST  REPORTERS.   WE WILL VOTE FOR THE COUNTRY WE WANT. WE WILL VOTE FOR THE FUTURE WE  WANT. WE WILL VOTE FOR THE POLITICS WE  WANT. AND WE WILL VOTE TO PUT THIS CORRUPT GOVERNMENT CARTEL OUT OF BUSINESS AND OUT OF BUSINESS IMMEDIATELY.   WE WILL VOTE FOR THE SPECIAL INTERESTS AND SAY, ""LOTS OF LUCK, BUT YOU ARE BEING VOTED  OUT OF POWER."" THEY HAD BETRAYED OUR WORKERS,  THEY HAD BETRAYED OUR BOR DERS, AND MOST OF ALL, THEY HAVE BETRAYED OUR FREEDOMS. WE WILL SAVE OUR SOVEREIGN  RIGHTS AS A NATION.  WE WILL END THE POLITICS OF  PROFIT. WE WILL END THE ROLE OF SPECIAL INTEREST. WE WILL END THE RATING OF OUR  JOBS BY OTHER COUNTRIES. WE WILL END THE TOTAL DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF THE AMERICAN VOTER AND THE AMERICAN  WORKER. OUR INDEPENDENCE DAY IS AT HAND, AND IT ARRIVES ON NOVEMBER 8.   JOIN ME IN TAKING  BACK OUR COUNTRY AND CREATING A  BRIGHT, GLORIOUS, AND PROSPEROUS  NEW FUTURE FOR OUR PEOPLE. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT  AGAIN, AND IT WILL HAPPEN  QUICKLY. GOD BLESS YOU.  GOD BLESS YOU.  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU. ","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Rally in West Palm Beach, Florida"

IT WOULD HELP CREATE CHINA.  WHEN THEY ARE MAKING THEM THEY  TALK ABOUT ALL THAT STUFF GOING  UP INTO THE AIR BUT MAYBE WE  SHOULD BE MAKING THEM INSTEAD OF  CHINA AND GERMANY AND OTHER PLACES.  INSTEAD OF REPAIRING THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE TOINFRASTRUCTURES OF THE CITIES LIKE FLINT.  MY ADMINISTRATION WILL ADDRESS THOSE LIKE THE EVERGLADES AND INCLUDING THE FIXING OF WATER  PROBLEMS LIKE LAKE OKEECHOBEE.  DO YOU NOTICE THEY ARE ALWAYS  LETTING THE WATER OUT.  HILLARY HAS RECEIVED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM DONORS THAT WANTS  TO SHUT DOWN AMERICAN ENERGY ALTOGETHER.  RADICAL ACTIVISTS LIKE TOM  PROMISED TO SPEND $70 MILLION TO  GET CLINTON DEMOCRATS IN RETURN TO SHUT DOWN THE PRODUCTION ALL  ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.  WE NEED TO PUT THE MINERS AND  STEEL WORKERS BACK TO WORK.  IT WOULD COST AMERICA OVER $5 TRILLION CAUSE THE  ELECTRICITY RATES TO SKYROCKET. THINK OF IT.  WE ARE GOING TO SPEND $5 TRILLION YOU KNOW WHAT'S  GOING TO HAPPEN WE WILL BECOME  NONCOMPETITIVE IN OTHER COUNTRIES.  WE WILL BECOME NONCOMPETITIVE. THE LARGEST POLLUTER BY FAR ONE  OF THE UNITED STATES MAKES DRASTIC CUTS IMMEDIATELY WHAT'S  THAT ALL ABOUT WHY AREN'T WE DOING IT TOGETHER IT'S ONE MORE  WAY THAT THEY'VE SURRENDERED AMERICAN PROSPERITY TO CHINA AND SO MANY OTHERS.  WE ARE LED BY PEOPLE THAT ARE GROSSLY INCOMPETENT.  IT TURNED OUT TO BE 1.7 BILLION.  IT'S LIKE THE STAGE LOADED UP WITH MONEY.  NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN IT. CAN YOU IMAGINE THESE PEOPLE  THREE YEARS AGO BEFORE WE MADE  THEM RICH AS A COUNTRY THEY WERE  READY TO GO BUT WE MADE THEM RICH.  HOW ABOUT THE PEOPLE READY FOR DEPORTATION.  READY FOR DEPORTATION.  THEY MADE A MISTAKE.  THEY ALL BECAME UNITED THE CITIZENS.  AND THESE WERE PEOPLE THAT WERE NOT EXACTLY GOOD.  THAT'S WHY THEY WERE BEING DEPORTED.  SOMEBODY SAID I WAS WRONG ON A NUMBER.  HERE WE GO. WITH 400, 799.  IT WAS LIKE 17 OR 1800. THEY SAID I WAS WRONG BECAUSE I WAS LOW.  I SAID THAT'S OKAY YOU CAN  DEPORTED THEM AND THEY SAID THAT  WOULDN'T BE CONSTITUTIONAL.  WOULD BE CONSTITUTIONAL.  WE ARE BEING LED BY STUPID PEOPLE. HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE WORSE THAN OBAMA.  IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT, WE  ARE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN.  THE SPEECHES EVEN SHOW CLINTON PRAISING THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA  FOR PROMISING TO ASSERT HIS AUTHORITY.  MY ENERGY PROPOSALS WILL UNLOCK  THE $50 TRILLION IN ENERGY  RESERVES RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA. THIS MEANS NEW JOBS IN FLORIDA  NOT NEW JOBS IN CHINA.  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA FIRST. IT'S ALL PART OF OUR PLAN TO  MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAIN BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO REPEAL AND REPLACE  THE DISASTER KNOWN AS OBAMACARE.  IN A MOMENT OF TRUTH TELLING HE'S HAD OBAMACARE WAS A CRAZY  SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE WIND UP WITH THEIR PREMIUMS DOUBLED. ON THIS HE WAS RIGHT. THE NEXT DAY HE CAME IN AND SAID I'M ONLY KIDDING.  PREMIUMS ARE GOING TO SURGE  BEYOND WHAT YOU HAVE DIVERSITY REPORT AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  I JUST LEFT TEXAS. THEY'VE GONE UP 60% THROUGH BLUE  CROSS BLUE SHIELD. AND REMEMBER THIS.  ON NOVEMBER 8 THEY ARE TRYING TO AMASS THESE INCREASES. THERE WILL BE 100% INCREASES,  95% INCREASES IF YOU'VE ALREADY GOT 68%, 72%.  INSURERS ARE FLEEING AND  PATIENTS ARE LOSING THEIR DOCTORS.  28 TIMES OBAMA SAID THAT.  HE LIED.  THE BEST STUDENTS DON'T WANT TO  BE THE HERS ANYMORE.  IT WILL DESTROY AMERICAN  HEALTHCARE FOR GOOD IF WE DON'T  GET RID OF IT AND THIS IS GOING TOIF THIS ISGOING TO BE SO PIVOTAL IN TERMS  OF THE COST FOR HEALTHCARE SO  REMEMBER YOU ARE GOING WERE GOING TO GET  GREAT HEALTH CARE AT A FAR REDUCED COURSE. OBAMACARE IS A NIGHTMARE AND  HILLARY WANTS TO GO TO SINGLE-PAYER.  CANADA WOULD HAVE A BETTER VERSION OF WHAT SHE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT PEOPLE WANT AN  OPERATION THEY COME TO THE  UNITED STATES TO GET IT.  IT'S SLOW. IT DOESN'T WORK. WE HAVE CONCEPTS THAT ARE SO GOOD THEY WILL ONLY GET BETTER.  WE HAVE TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE.  IT'S KILLING THE COUNTRY INTO THEAND THEPEOPLE THAT HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.  BUT YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE.  WE WILL REPLACE OBAMACARE WITH HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS SO YOU CAN CHOOSE THE PRIVATE DOCTOR YOU WANT.  WE WILL BE FIXING OUR TERRIBLE  TRADE DEALS AND IF YOU REMEMBER  ON JUNE 16 16TH LAST YEAR THAT'S  WHEN I SAID WE ARE GOING TO RUN  AND IT TAKES A LOT OF GUTS AND  COURAGE TO DO THIS.  I STARTED OFF INTO THEIR VERSES AND TEEN PEOPLE.  SOME DIDN'T HONOR THEIR PLEDGE  BUT THESE ARE MINOR DETAILS. BUT WE HAD SOME GREAT PEOPLE MANY OF WHOM ARE SUPPORTING US, DOCTOR BEN CARSON, GREAT GUY,  CHRIS CHRISTIE.  WE HAVE INCREDIBLE SUPPORT, MIKE  HUCKABEE, HE IS SO GOOD.  HE SAID THE OTHER NIGHT DONALD  TRUMP WON THAT DEBATE BY A LANDSLIDE. HE SAID TRUMP WANTED EASY BUT  THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE CNN OF THE  WORLD WILL NEVER SAY. COMPLETE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN  DEBATED IT AND WAS AND WAS REPRESENTING THE  POINT OF VIEW, CNN WAS A ABRAHAM  LINCOLN WENT DOWN TO A MASSIVE  DEFEAT. THESE ARE DISHONEST PEOPLE WE  ARE DEALING WITH. .. THE 45 MILLION AMERICANS ARE IN POVERTY.  THIS IS THE LEGACY OF OBAMA CLINTON.  ENERGY TAXES REGULATION AND TRADE WERE CREATING 25 MILLION  JOBS ARE THE NEXT 10 YEARS BUT  IT'S GOING TO BE UNBELIEVABLE.  WILL BE THE GREATEST JOBS PRESIDENT THAT GOD EVER CREATED,  BELIEVE ME.  THE STATE OF FLORIDA HAS LOST  ONE IN FOUR MANUFACTURING JOBS  SINCE NAFTA AND CHINA DEALS HAPPENED.  THANK YOU, I LOVE YOU TOO DARLING. I LOVE FLORIDA.  I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA.  I HAVE CREATED MANY, MANY JOBS  IN FLORIDA.  JOBS IN MIAMI BEACH, TO ROW AND  A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS AND  MAR-A-LAGO MAR-A-LAGO AND THE CLUBS AND WE HAVE DONE ALL OF THAT.  AND REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE IN THE  PRIMARY I RAN AGAINST MARCO, JEB  AND ALL THESE GUYS AND WE HAD -- MARCO HAS BEEN VERY NICE LATELY  AND I HOPE HE WINDS, I DO BUT WE  WON BY 21 POINTS. WHENEVER BACK? EVERYONE SAID WOULD HAPPEN?  I WENT INTO A COUPLE OF STATES  AND TRUMP IS ONE POINT DOWN AND  THEN WE WIN BY 14 POINTS. WE COULD HAVE THIS HAPPEN. WE ARE PRETTY EVEN IN FLORIDA  AND I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE HILLARY HASN'T CREATED A  JOB AND I HAVE CREATED THOUSANDS  OF JOBS IN FLORIDA, THOUSANDS.  AT THE ROLE RADEL I HAVE OVER  1000 PEOPLE WORKING. MAR-A-LAGO. MANY JOBS.  BUILDINGS ALONG THE BEACH IN MIAMI.  WE HAVE CREATED A LOT OF JOBS SO  IF YOU GUYS DON'T VOTE ME AS A  VICTOR I'M GOING TO BE VERY ANGRY.  HILLARY DOESN'T COME DOWN TO FLORIDA.  IF SHE COMES DOWN TO FLORIDA TO  TRY TO GET YOUR VOTE YOU WON'T  SEE HER ANYMORE.  HILLARY CLINTON GETS IT  MANUFACTURES THAT ARE LEFT IN FLORIDA OHIO NORTH CAROLINA PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN WILL BE  SHIPPED TO OTHER COUNTRIES,  SHIPPED OVERSEAS AND GO TO MEXICO. THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.  IF I WIN DAY ONE WE ARE GOING TO ANNOUNCE OUR PLANS TO TOTALLY RENEGOTIATE NAFTA WHICH IS A  ONE-WAY STREET FOR BUSINESSES TO  LEAVE OUR COUNTRY.  THEY GET THE BUSINESSES, THEY  GET THE CASH AND YOU KNOW WHAT  WE GET? WE GET THE DRUGS. WE GET NOTHING.  WE GET UNEMPLOYMENT AND WE GET DRUGS.  YEARS OF ALL TALK AND NO ACTION  POLITICIANS LIKE HER WILL END.  I'M NOT CONTROLLED BY SPECIAL INTERESTS AND I WILL IMMEDIATELY  GET TO WORK AND THAT'S WHAT I'M  PUTTING UP MY OWN MONEY FOR THE  MOST PART OF HER THAN GETTING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF SMALL  CONTRIBUTIONS AVERAGE OF $61 PER  USE OF THE NUMBERS IN EFFECT  THEY'RE GOING TO BE ANNOUNCED TOMORROW.  WE SET RECORDS FOR REPUBLICANS  ON THE SMALL CONTRIBUTIONS.  I LOVE THAT. AND WE ARE DOING GOOD.  WE JUST CAME UP WITH THE A NEW  COMMERCIAL ON CROOKED HILLARY.  SHE IS AS CROOKED AS A 3-DOLLAR BILL. I USED TO SAY IF HE HAD A  2-DOLLAR BILL BUT NOW THEY MAKE  3-DOLLAR BILLS.  IF WE DON'T GET THE DAILY ONE ON  NAFTA, REMEMBER I SAID IT, WE  BELIEVE NAFTA AND START OVER  AGAIN AND MAKE A MUCH BETTER DEAL.  WE WILL TERMINATE. A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL ALSO  STAND UP TO CHINA'S PRODUCT DUMPING AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING  TO OUR STEEL COMPANIES IS UNBELIEVABLE. WE ARE GOING TO START MAKING  THINGS AGAIN IN AMERICA. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE APPLE MAKE THEIR IPHONES IN THIS COUNTRY,  NOT MAKE EVERYTHING IN CHINA AND  VIETNAM AND THESE OTHER COUNTRIES.  WE ARE GOING TO BRING APPLE AND  MANY OTHER COMPANIES.  THEY ARE GOING TO BE BACK IN THE  UNITED STATES. OUR JOBS ARE GOING WITH MUCH LOWER BUSINESS TAXES.  WE WILL BRING THE TAX.  FROM 35% TO 15% AND WE ARE GOING  TO BE BOOMING AGAIN.  OUR TAXES ARE SO HIGH, OUR TAXES  ARE SO HIGH THAT BUSINESSES ARE  FORCED TO LEAVE HIM BY THE WAY  WHEN BUSINESSES WANT TO BE RIPPED OUT OF FLORIDA, REP OUT  OF YOUR COMMUNITY, IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE BECAUSE THERE ARE GOING TO BE  CONSEQUENCES LIKE CARRIER  AIR-CONDITIONING IN THE STATE OF  INDIANA WHERE MIKE PENCE BY THE  WAY IS DOING A GREAT JOB FOR ME.  WE LIKE MIKE.  SO MIKE DID A GREAT JOB. HE ABSOLUTELY BE TIM KAINE WHO  YOU KNOW, TIM KAINE RAISE TAXES IN HIS FIRST WEEK WHEN HE WAS  GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA.  HE WAS NOT A POPULAR GOVERNOR.  HE RAISED THEM BY $4 BILLION. MIKE ON THE OTHER HAND INDIANA  YOU TAKE A LOOK, HE HAS DONE  SUCH A GREAT JOB SO HERE'S MY QUESTION TO YOU.  BY CHEERING, WHO DID BETTER IN THE DEBATE?  ARE YOU READY?  YOU CAN SHARE LET ME KNOW. I DID VERY WELL.  DID YOU SEE HILLARY TODAY?  DID EVERYBODY SEE THE DEBATE?  E, YOU LOST. I LOOK FORWARD TO NEXT WEEK WE  HAVE ANOTHER WHEN.  DID YOU SEE, WAIT, WAIT DID YOU  SEE WHAT SHE SAID THAT I ENTERED HER SPACE.  YOU SAW THAT.  THIS IS A LIAR.  SO I AM STANDING AT MY PODIUM, I'VE GOT MY CHAIR AND CROOKED  HILLARY WALKS ACROSS THE STAGE  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. I DIDN'T MOVE, RIGHT?  SO I'M STANDING AND SHE WALKS  ACROSS THE STAGE. SHE'S STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF  ME.  I DIDN'T CARE.  I DIDN'T CARE.  AND SHE IS ANSWERING THE  QUESTION AND THEN SHE WALKS  RIGHT BACK.  OKAY, THAT'S FINE.  THE NEXT THING I SAID, I READ  THE PAPER.  SHE ENTERED MY SPACE. BUT DID YOU SEE WHAT SHE SAID?  THAT I ENTERED HER SPACE.  AND I WAS VERY CAREFUL BECAUSE YEARS AGO IF SOMEBODY DID COME  IN AND TALK TO HER AND THE POOR GUY LAZIO, I SAID I'M NOT  GETTING NEAR THIS WOMAN. I AM NOT GETTING NEAR THIS WOMAN  AT ALL.  NO INTEREST, NO INTEREST. I HAVE NO INTEREST.  SO I'M STANDING THERE.  SHE STANDS RIGHT NEXT TO ME AND  THE NEXT DAY THEY SAID DONALD  TRUMP ENTERED HER SPACE.  THESE ARE DISHONEST PEOPLE.  ANYWAY NEXT WEEK WE HAVE ANOTHER DEBATE IN LAS VEGAS.  AMERICA, IF I AM ELECTED WILL  BECOME, THEY ALWAYS GO WHEN. YOU DON'T WANT TO SOUND TOO EAGER.  THE POLLS ARE PRETTY EVEN IN  FLORIDA.  JUST DON'T LET ME DOWN.  DON'T LET ME DOWN.  HONESTLY, DON'T LET YOURSELVES DOWN MAYBE MORE PORTLY. AMERICA WILL BECOME THE GREAT  JOBS MAGNET OF THE WORLD. REMEMBER THIS. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO FIX HER INNER CITIES AND HELP OUR LATINO AMERICANS AND BELIEVE ME THAT SO  WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.  THE HISPANICS IN THIS COUNTRY  HAVE BEEN TREATED VERY UNFAIRLY.  THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE BEEN  TREATED VERY, VERY UNFAIRLY.  45% OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH  LIVE IN POVERTY.  58% OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH  DON'T HAVE JOBS.  ONLY 41% OWN THEIR OWN HOME. THAT'S MUCH, MUCH LOWER THAN  OTHER GROUPS.  41% IS A VERY LOW NUMBER, ONE OF  THE LOWEST.  MORE THAN 4000 PEOPLE A MAN SHOT  CHICAGO SINCE JANUARY 1, 3000 PEOPLE.  SO THE INNER CITIES DON'T HAVE  JOBS, THEY HAVE A LOUSY  EDUCATION, RIGHT?  A LOUSY, HORRIBLE AND THEY GET  SHOT WALKING TO THE STORY.  SO I SAY TO THE  AFRICAN-AMERICANS, SUFFERING IN  OUR INNER CITIES, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?  VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.  WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?  I WILL FIX FIX IT FIX IT.  I WILL DO THE JOB AND IN FOUR  YEARS FROM NOW, WHEN WE HAVE  ANOTHER ELECTION, I WILL WIN  WITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND I WILL WIN WITH HISPANICS IN VERY  LARGE NUMBERS. WE ARE GOING TO FIX FIX IT.  THESE POLITICIANS HAVE BEEN  LYING TO YOU FOR YEARS, THESE DEMOCRATS.  THEY HAVE RUN A INNER CITIES FOR  UP TO 100 YEARS, EVEN MORE,  UNINTERRUPTED AND THEY COME TO  VOTE EVERY FOUR YEARS. HILLARY CLINTON COMES FOR YOUR VOTE AND YOU WILL GET A VOTE AND  IF AFTER YOU GET THE VOTE SHE  WILL SAY I WILL SEE YOU IN FOUR  YEARS, HERE'S THE DOOR.  SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR NEW  YORK STATE. UPSTATE NEW YORK IS A DISASTER.  SHE CAME OUT AND SHE SAID SHE  WOULD CREATE 2000 JOBS.  EVERYBODY LAUGHED.  SHE WAS A DISASTER AND SHE'S A  BAD PERSON. REMEMBER THAT, SHE'S A BAD BAD PERSON.  I WILL FIGHT HARDER FOR YOU THAN  ANYONE EVER HAS FOR PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHY I WANT TO GUESS THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE AND I WANT  TO GET THE HISPANIC VOTE.  WE ARE GOING TO FIX YOUR  COMMITTEES AND FIX THOSE INNER  CITIES ONCE AND FOR ALL AND WE  ARE GOING TO CREATE JOBS AND A  GREAT EDUCATION AND WE ARE GOING  TO HAVE SAFE INNER CITIES  INSTEAD OF THESE HORRIBLE  HORRIBLE DEATH TRAPS AND THAT'S  WHAT THEY ARE.  WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR THE TINO'S TRAPPED IN POVERTY.  THAT INCLUDES SCHOOL CHOICE FOR  EVERY LOW-INCOME AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO,  HISPANIC CHILD IN THIS NATION.  DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN WILL BE ABLE TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO THE PUBLIC PRIVATE CHARTER OR OF MAGNET SCHOOLS OF THEIR CHOICE.  I ALSO HAVE A MESSAGE FOR OUR  WONDERFUL CUBAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.  MANY CUBANS HERE ARE? CUBAN-AMERICANS?  OBAMA MADE A ONE-SIDED DEAL WITH  THE CASTRO REGIME.  BY EXECUTIVE ORDER, EVERYTHING IS EXECUTIVE ORDER BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME BECAUSE HE IS PLAYING SO MUCH GOLF. HE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO  CONVINCE CONGRESS TO DO IT. THIS GUY PLAYS MORE GOLF THAN  PEOPLE ON THE PGA TOUR.  WE WILL CANCEL THE OBAMA ORDER  UNLESS WE GET THE DEAL THAT WE  WANT INCLUDING POLITICAL AND  RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR THE PEOPLE  OF CUBA.  WE WILL ALSO STAND WITH THEIR  FRIENDS IN VENEZUELA AS THEY STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM AND DORAL  IS LOCATED IN A BIG COMMUNITY  WHERE WE HAVE TREMENDOUS NUMBERS  OF PEOPLE FROM VENEZUELA.  THE PEOPLE OF VENEZUELA AND CUBA KNOW HOW DANGEROUS CORRUPTION IS  AND HOW DANGEROUS SOCIALISM IS.  TWO MORE REASONS WHY WE HAVE TO KEEP CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON OUT  OF THE WAY.  HERE IS THE MORE AMAZING THING  AS WE FINISH UP THAT WE ARE  GOING TO DO FOR OUR COUNTRY STARTING IN 2017 WHICH IS RIGHT  AROUND THE CORNER. WE ARE GOING TO MASSIVELY CUT  TAXES AND REGULATION. SHE IS GOING TO INCREASE TAXES. WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT INTERNET FREEDOM. YOU SEE WHAT THEY WANT TO HAVE  THE INTERNET RUN BY THE WORLD? YOU SEE WHAT OBAMA WANTS TO DO?  I HOPE WE CAN STOP THAT BELFAST.  DID YOU SEE THAT?  HE WANTS TO GIVE UP THE  TREMENDOUS RIGHTS.  WE ARE GOING TO DEFEND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.  WE ARE GOING TO SAFEGUARD A VERY  OBSOLETE ELECTRICAL GRID FROM CYBER ATTACK.  CYBER ATTACK IS IN A BIG PROBLEM.  WE ARE GOING TO REBUILD A DEPLETED MILITARY AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR GREAT VETERANS.  WE HAVE TREMENDOUS VETERANS  SUPPORT, TREMENDOUS VETERAN  SUPPORT.  WE ARE GOING TO CONSTRUCT A STATE-OF-THE-ART SYSTEM OF  MISSILE DEFENSE.  WE ARE GOING TO EXPAND AMERICA AS THE LEADER IN SPACE.  WE ARE GOING TO SAVE OUR 2ND  AMENDMENT WHICH IS UNDER SIEGE BY HILLARY CLINTON.  AND THE NATIONAL RIFLE  ASSOCIATION, THE NRA AS YOU KNOW ENDORSE ME, THE EARLIEST  ENDORSEMENT THEY HAVE EVER GIVEN  TO A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.  THIS IS SO A PORT AND, WE ARE  GOING TO APPOINT JUSTICES TO THE  UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WHO  WILL UPHOLD AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.  YOU HAVE 28 DAYS TO MAKE EVERY  DREAM THAT YOU EVER DREAMED FOR  YOUR COUNTRY BECOME TRUE.  ON NOVEMBER 8, SO IMPORTANT.  THE ARROGANCE OF WASHINGTON D.C.  WILL COME FACE TO FACE WITH THE  RIGHTEOUS AMERICAN VOTER, YOU.  WE ARE GOING TO REPLACE OUR CORRUPT GLOBAL ESTABLISHMENT  THAT IS FAILED US ON THE  BORDERS, ON TRADE, ON FOREIGN  POLICY, ON THE ECONOMY AND SO  MUCH MORE.  WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE, FOLKS.  WHEN DID YOU SEE US WIN THE?  WE LOSE ON TRADE.  WE CAN'T BEAT ISIS AND BY THE  WAY WE ARE GOING TO KNOCK THE  HELL OUT OF ISIS.  WE ARE GOING TO REPLACE THE  FAILED LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON  WHO HAVE SQUANDERED YOUR WEALTH  AND SOLD OUT YOUR COUNTRY AND BY  THE WAY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE  STRONG BORDERS AND WE WILL BUILD THE WALL AND WE WILL STOP DRUGS FROM POURING IN.   WE WILL BUILD THE WALL.  OKAY FOLKS ARE YOU READY?  WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WAL? 100%.  THEY MIGHT NOT KNOW IT BUT THEY WILL.  MEXICO IS GREAT AND THE PEOPLE  ARE GREAT.  YOU PROBABLY SAW IT WENT TO  MEXICO AND MET WITH THE  PRESIDENT AND IT WAS GREAT. AND WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL  AND THEY ARE GOING TO PAY.  THE REASON THEY ARE GOING TO PAY  AS THEY ARE MAKING A FORTUNE ON TRADE.  OUR TRADE DEFICIT WITH MEXICO IS  MASSIVE THAN OUR TRADE DEFICIT  WITH CHINA IS BEYOND ANYTHING  YOU CAN EVEN IMAGINE.  WORLDWIDE ON TRADE WE LOST  ALMOST 800 YEN DOLLARS. YOU SAY TO YOURSELF THAT NEGOTIATES THE STEEL'S?  MY FRIENDS WHO ARE GOOD BUSINESS  PEOPLE ARE SITTING HERE SAYING  WHO HERE SAYING THAT NEGOTIATES  THE STEEL'S?  THEY ARE IN THE ADVANCE AND ONE  GUY IS LOOKING AT ME LAUGHING.  AND COMPETENT PEOPLE OR CORRUPT  PEOPLE, OKAY?  THEY ARE EITHER INCOMPETENT OR CORRUPT.  I AM ASKING ALL AMERICANS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS BACK  AND DEMOCRATS TO JOIN US IN OUR  CAMPAIGN TO GIVE OUR GOVERNMENT BACK TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  I AM GOING TO FIGHT FOR EVERY  CITIZEN OF EVERY BACKGROUND, FROM EVERY STRETCH OF THIS  NATION AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT TO  BRING US ALL TOGETHER AS AMERICANS.  WE ARE A DIVIDED COUNTRY, FOLKS.  WE ARE DIVIDED IN SO MANY WAYS.  WE ARE GOING TO BE UNIFIED  COUNTRY AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO LOVE EACH OTHER, EVERYBODY. NOT JUST THE PEOPLE HERE.  AND BY THE WAY IS THERE EVER A  BETTER OR SAFER PLACE TO BE THAN A TRUMP RALLIED?  YOU HAD BETTER MAKE SURE WE WIN OR THERE WILL BE NO MORE TRUMP RALLIES.  THE HELL WITH THE RALLIES.  IMAGINE WHAT OUR COUNTRY COULD  ACCOMPLISH IF WE STARTED WORKING  TOGETHER AS ONE PEOPLE UNDER ONE  GOD, SALUTING ONE AMERICAN FLAG.  YOU ARE GOING TO LOOK BACK AT  THIS RALLY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.  YOU ARE GOING TO REMEMBER THIS DAY.  THIS IS A MOVEMENT LIKE NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE.  IT'S AN AMAZING THING.  WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED ALMOST.  IT'S AN AMAZING THING WHEN WE GO OUT TO PENNSYLVANIA, WE HAVE  20,000 PEOPLE.  WE GO TO ALABAMA AND WE HAVE  35,000 PEOPLE.  WE GO TO DIFFERENT PLACES AND WE GET CROWDS THAT NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE FOR WHAT WE ARE DOING AND I DON'T HAVE THE GUITAR.  SOMEBODY SAID YOU GET THE  BIGGEST CROWDS IN THE WORLD FOR  A GUY WITHOUT A GUITAR WHICH IS  AN INTERESTING WAY OF LOOKING AT  IT.  I WILL TELL YOU WHO SAID THAT,  VERY FAMOUS GUY.  HE HAPPENS TO BE VERY LIBERAL  AND I WILL REALLY GET IN TROUBLE.  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE HISTORY TOGETHER. YOU ARE GOING TO LOOK BACK AT THIS ELECTION AND SAY THIS IS BY  FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT VOTE THAT YOU HAVE EVER CAST AT ANY TIME IN YOUR LIFE, NOVEMBER 8.  A VOTE FOR ME IS A VOTE FOR CHANGE.  A VOTE FOR ME IT'S REALLY A VOTE  FOR YOU. WE ARE GOING TO RUN THINGS RIGHT  AMERICA FIRST, REMEMBER, AMERICA FIRST.  WE ARE GOING TO PUT OUR COUNTRY  FIRST FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A  LONG TIME.  ONCE AGAIN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE  A GOVERNMENT OF, BY AND FOR THE PEOPLE.  WE WILL MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY  AGAIN.  WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN  AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  THANK YOU, GOD BLESS YOU EVERYONE. THANK  YOU VERY MUCH.

SHE DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE. IF YOU WANTED TO COME SHE COULD  NOT. YOU KNOW, NEW YORK STATE SHE RAN FOR SENATE AND YOU KNOW UPSTATE  NEW YORK IS A DISASTER FOR JOBS. SHE SAID I'M GOING TO BRING BACK  200,000 JOBS. GUESS WHAT? WORSE TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE. HOW MONEY WATCH THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT?   AMAZING. WE HAD A LOT OF FUN. I WOULD TELL YOU THAT HILLARY IS  HIGHLY OVERRATED. I WON. IT WAS A UNANIMOUS DECISION. IT WAS A PAINFUL EXPERIENCE -- WHAT IS GOOD FOR ME IS GOOD FOR  YOU.  I MEAN THAT TOTALLY 100%. WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A LOT  OF THINGS TODAY BUT I ALWAYS  WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THIS ABOVE  ALL ELSE.  WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK THE  JOSSEY PENNSYLVANIA. WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK STEEL. STEEL HAS BEEN STOLEN FROM YOU  IN THIS AREA. NATURAL GAS, THE EPA IS DEALING  YOU AND YOUR CURRENT BEANIES -- AND YOUR COMPANIES. THAT WILL BE TURNED AROUND ON  DAY ONE WHEN I WIN. DAY ONE. THAT MEANS WE ARE GOING TO TAKE  CARE OF OUR STEELWORKERS AND OUR  MINERS, BELIEVE ME.   LOWER TAXES, BETTER TRADE DEALS -- AND MILLIONS AND  MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS. BUT ALL CROOKED HILLARY CAN DO  WAS TALK ABOUT SMALL, PETTY T HINGS LAST NIGHT.  DURING THE COURSE OF 90 MINUTES, SHE WAS EXPOSED -- AND HER  MINIONS WERE EXPOSED. ALL SHE COULD DO IS LIE.  SHE LIED SO MUCH LAST NIGHT. THEY DO NOT LIKE TO CATCH HER ON  THE LIES.  I EXPLAINED HOW HILLARY CLINTON  OVERSAW THE DISASTERS IN LIBYA, INCLUDING THE DRAWING OF THE INFORMATION REDLINE. SHE WAS IN, BY THE WAY. -- SHE WASN'T THERE, BY THWEE WAY. NO, SHE WAS THERE. SHE LIED ABOUT IT.  SHE SAID USE NOT INVOLVED. BUT THAT WAS JUST ONE OF MANY. OF COURSE, THE MODERATORS DID NOT CALL HER OUT AND HE DID NOT  CALL OUT LIST LIE THAT YOU TOLD.  HILLARY CLINTON SAID SHE DID NOT  DELETE YOUR E-MAILS AFTER A CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENA, BUT SHE  DID. THAT WAS ANOTHER LIE. THAT WAS A HARD ONE TO BELIEVE.  HOW DID SHE SAY NO TO THAT ONE? THE SUBPOENA WAS SENT ON MARCH 4, 2015. CROOKED HILLARY'S E-MAILS WAS BLEACHED -- NOBODY BLEACHED  THEM. BLEACHING IS A VERY EXPENSIVE  PROCESS. WHEN YOU BLEACHED THEM IT PRETTY MUCH MEANS THEY ARE GONE,  OTHERWISE ALWAYS HEARD YOU  CANNOT GET RID OF THE DESPERATE TO WONDER IF THE NSA HAS HER  E-MAILS, DO YOU THINK? I DO NOT THINK THEY HAVE LOOKED TOO HARD FOR HER E-MAILS. WHAT YOU THINK, FOLKS? I DON'T KNOW THIS FOR A FACT,  BUT I BET WITHIN THE FBI -- U.S.  SOME OF THE GREATEST AMERICANS IN THE WORLD THAT IS SO PROUD OF THE FBI, AND I BET YOU THEY ARE  SICK TO THE STOMACH AT WHAT IS  HAPPENING, SICK TO THE STOMACH.   ANYWAY, HER E-MAILS  WERE DESTROYED SOMEWHERE BETWEEN  MARCH 25 AND MARCH 31, AT THE  CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENA WAS  RECEIVED.  IF YOU ARE SUING SOMEONE PRIVATELY AND THE DELETE AND GET  RID OF ALL YOUR STUFF THAT YOU SUBPOENA, YOU HAVE A VERY BIG  CONSEQUENCE. YOU KNOW WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES, RIGHT? THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS,  SUBPOENA E-MAILS AND OTHER  THINGS, AND THEY ARE GONE.  AND NOW BY THE WAY, TWO BOXES OF  E-MAILS AND MATERIALS ARE NOW  MISSING.   VERY, VERY SAD. SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, HERE WE  COME, RIGHT? IF I WIN WE ARE GOING TO APPOINT  A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.  BECAUSE WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO  HAPPEN TO OUR COUNTRY, WE  CANNOT.  IF IWE'RE ARE LIKE A THIRD WORLD  NATION. HILLARY HAD NO DEFENSE FOR HER  CONTRACT. SHE DID NOT EVEN TRY TO DEFEND  THE RIDICULOUS CLAIM THAT THESE WERE 30,000 E-MAILS ABOTUT YOGA  AND WEDDING PLANNING. LET'S SEE, YOU HAD 33,000  E-MAILS DELETED, RIGHT? I WOULD BET SHE HAD THREE FOR  YOGA AND MAYBE FIVE FOR THE  WEDDING.  WHAT ABOUT THE REST? SHE HAD NO DEFENSE WHEN I BROUGHT UP HER FAILURES IN IRAQ,  SYRIA AND LIBYA. SHE AND NO DEFENSE WHEN I  BROUGHT UP HER FAILURES AS A  SENATOR FROM NEW YORK, PROMISING  TO RE-CREATE THE 200,000 JOBS  WERE UPSTATE NEW YORK. BUT INSTEAD THE JOBS WERE  SHIPPED TO MEXICO AND OTHER  COUNTRIES. SHE HAD NO DEFENSE FOR CALLING  ON MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AND THEN SAYING THAT THEY WERE DEPLORABLE -- THAT'S YOU, DEPLORABLE. ME, DEPLORABLE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT IS WORSE, IRRITABLE.  WHICH IS WORSE? IRREDEEMABLE AND DEPLORABLE. I THINK WE HAVE THE GREATEST PEOPLE ON EARTH.  THE SMARTEST PEOPLE.  WE HAVE THE SMARTEST PEOPLE. WE HAVE THE MOST LOYAL PEOPLE. THAT IS ONE THING -- EVEYRY POLL  POINTS OUT THAT TRUMP'S PEOPLE ARE THE MOST LOYAL EVER. ONE THING I KNOW I'M A WE ARE  GOING TO GET OUT AND VOTE, AND WE ARE GOING TO BE VOTING. DO YOU REMEMBER THE PRIMARIES? DONALD TRUMP IS BEHIND, VOTING BEGINS TOMORROW, SHOULD BE  INTERESTING BUT IT LOOKS LIKE  MR. TRUMP WILL NOT BE ABLE TO  WIN THIS STATE. BUT HE PUT UP A GOOD FIGHT IT IN  NEXT DAY -- DONALD TRUMP WINS BY  22 POINTS.   MR.  BREXIT. MR. BREXIT. REMEMBER I SAID BREXIT IS WHAT YOU HAPPEN? MAIL LISSETTE DONALD TRUMP SAID THAT BREXIT IS GOING TO HAPPEN -- THEY ALL SAID DONALD TRUMP  SAID THAT BREXIT IS WOULD YOU  HAPPEN. BUT THAT IS ALL RIGHT.  THIS IS LIKE BREXIT, YOU WATCH. WE WANT OUR BORDERS STRONG, WE  DO NOT WANT PEOPLE COMING IN FROM SYRIA WHO WE DO NOT KNOW WHO THE HELL THEY ARE.   AS I SAID LAST NIGHT -- AND I MEAN THIS -- SHE HAS  HATRED IN HER HEART. SHE WANTS TO DIVIDE AMERICA. I WANT TO BRING US TOGETHER AS ONE PEOPLE.   IN BY THE WAY -- AND  BY THE WAY, WE HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE.  DO YOU KNOW HOW LUCKY YOU ARE? DO YOU KNOW HOW LUCKY YOU ARE? AND I GUESS THEY'RE NOT ALLOWING  THEM INCOME I DO NOT KNOW WHY.  WHERE IS THE FIRE MARSHAL? LETS THEM MORE PEOPLE COME IN, I  SEE SOME SEATS OVER THERE. FIRE MARSHAL, I SEE SOME HELP. WHERE IS THE FIRE MARSHAL? LET THEM COME IN. WE HAVE THREE OR FOUR -- WE HAVE  3000 4000 PEOPLE OUT THERE. WE OUGHT TO LET SOME MORE PEOPLE  COME IN. IOWA'S GET A KICK -- I KNOW A  LOT ABOUT FIRE AND FIRE MARSHALS -- BUT YOU HAVE A ROOM WITH FOUR  WALLS AND EIGHT ROOF -- AND A ROOF. LET THE PEOPLE AND. HILLARY ALSO HAD NO DEFENSE FOR  OBAMACARE, WHICH IS A TOTAL  DISASTER. I'M GOING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE  OR DISASTERS OBAMACARE. MUCH CHEAPER, MUCH BETTER.   HILLARY HAD NO DEFENSE FOR HER SECRET SPEECH IS  THE WALL STREET AND INTERNATIONAL BANK THAT SHE HID  FROM THE PUBLIC AND WHICH WERE EXPOSED BY WIKILEAKS! JUST AS I'M WALKING ON THE STAGE, MALIC -- MAYOR GIULIANI SAID YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS, WE HAVE ALL OF THESE NEW  CHARGES THAT JUST CAME DOWN  TODAY. WITH THE LEASE, SOME NEW STUFF.  SOME BRUTAL STUFF. I MAY NOT READ IT BUT THE HELL WITH IT, IS REAL BAD STUFF. THE SPEECHES CONTAIN SCANDALOUS REVELATIONS ABOUT HILLARY  CLINTON THAT DISQUALIFY HER FROM SEEKING PUBLIC OFFICE. AND SHE IS. SHE IS AS QUALIFIED JUST ON THE  FACT THAT SHE DID THAT WITH HER  E-MAILS -- IS DISQUALIFIED JUST  FROM THE FACT THAT SHE DELETED  HER E-MAILS. HOW COULD YOU DO IT? THIS COULD SHINE A SPOTLIGHT ON  HOW THIS CORRUPT ESTABLISHMENT WORKS, WHERE POLITICIANS MEET IN  SECRET WITH THE BIG BANKS,  COLLECT MASSIVE SUMS OF MONEY,  THEN BETRAY THE AMERICAN WORKER,  WHICH IS YOU AND ME AND SORT OF  ALL OF US, WE ARE ALL WORKERS. WHERE ARE WORKING, WE JUST WORK  DIFFERENTLY. YOU KNOW, I TELL THIS TO PEOPLE. WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM  RIGHT NOW THAT MADE MORE MONEY  18 YEARS AGO THAN THEY ARE MAKING NOW. THEY WORK A LOT HARDER RIGHT NOW  THAN THEY DID 18 YEARS AGO. THEIR JOB WAS BETTER 18 YEARS AGO, AND THEY ARE OLDER. THE ONLY THING I SAY IS I AM OLDER, ALSO, AND I'VE NEVER  WORKED THIS HARD EITHER, FOLKS,  THAT IS FOR SURE. MY CAMPAIGN IS POWERED BY MY MONEY AND ALSO SMALL DONATIONS  FROM MILLIONS OF VISITORS TO OUR  WEBSITE WHO JUST WANT THEIR COUNTRY BACK.  THEY WANT AMERICA BACK.   LAST NIGHT, I ASKED HILLARY CLINTON WHY SHE DOES NOT  TAKE SOME OF THE HUNDREDS OF  MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT SHE MADE -- MY MONEY -- IS THAT  SMART OR IS THAT STUPID? TAKE SOME OF THE MONEY SHE MADE SELLING FAVORS FOR SPECIAL  INTEREST AND INVEST THEM IN HER CAMPAIGN INSTEAD OF HAVING TO  RELY ON EVEN MORE CORPORATE DONATIONS.  SHE LOOKED LIKE, OH MY GOD, WHY DID HE BRING THAT UP? SHE HAD NO ANSWER. SHE WAS FLABBERGASTED. AND THE SECRET SPEECH IS  RELEASED BY WIKILEAKS YESTERDAY  AND TODAY BEFORE, -- NOT AS GOOD AS TODAY I WILL SAY BECAUSE THE  MEDIA TRIES TO PROTECT AIR.  THE ONLY THING SHE HAS GOING IS  THE MEDIA. WITHOUT IMMEDIATE, SHE WOULD NOT HAVE A CHANCE. -- WITHOUT THE MEDIA, SHE WOULD  NOT HAVE A CHANCE.   HILLARY CLINTON TOLD  HER WALL STREET DONORS THAT YOU  NEED TO HAVE A PUBLIC POSITION  AND A PRIVATE POSITION.  IN OTHER WORDS, YOU NEED TO BE DISHONEST FOR ALL -- TO RUN FOR OFFICE. THAT IS VERY MUCH RIGHT IN THAT WHOLE THING, IT IS CRAZY. HOW DID HILLARY CLINTON TRIED TO DEFEND THIS SHOCKING ADMISSION? SHE DID NOT DENY SHE SAID THIS  AWFUL THING AND INSTEAD SHE  BLAMED HONEST A LINCOLN -- ABE LINCOLN. HONEST ABE! HILLARY CLINTON FOR LYING,  BLAMED A LINCOLN, CALMEST --  COMMONLY KNOWN AS HONEST ABE LINCOLN. SPINNING IN HIS GRAVE. ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF HOW HILLARY CLINTON'S PUBLIC POSITION IS A LIE.  SHE WANTS TO NOT THE HELL OUT OF  YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY, SHE WANTS  TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF -- I WILL SAVE THEM. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY  RICH AGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK OUR  JOBS. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE GOOD TRADE  DEALS. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE COUNTRIES  THAT WE ARE DEFENDING ALL OVER  THE WORLD PAY A LOW BIT MORE  MONEY IF THAT IS OK. WHICH, IN ALL FAIRNESS, UNTIL I  CAME ALONG YOU NEVER EVEN HEARD  ABOUT THAT. WHEN I SAY THAT THEY SAY TRUMP  DOES NOT WANT TO DEFEND JAPAN. LET THEM A LITTLE MORE MONEY,  RIGHT, ISN'T THAT GOOD? WITHOUT IT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE $20 TRILLION IN DEBT. SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES WE DO SUCH A GOOD JOB FOR WHERE WE DEFEND THEM -- AND WE LOVE DOING IT, BUT THEY HAVE TO HELP US OUT A LITTLE BIT.  MOST SHOCKINGLY THE SPEECHES  SHOW HILLARY CLINTON SAYING,  QUOTE, MY DREAM IS A HEMISPHERE,  AND MARKET WITH OPEN TRADE -- IN -- YOU KNOW WWHAT THAT DOES? IT'S OVER SHE.WANTS THEO UNITED STATES TO SURRENDER TO GLOBAL GOVERNORS WITH NO  CONTROLPEN BORDERS.  FOR TRADE AND IMMIGRATION.  GREAT. CAN YOU IMAGINE? SHE IS SAYING SHE'S WERE NASA -- SHE'S SAYING SHE'S FOR NAFTA. NAFTA, THE WORST RADIO EVER MADE  IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. -- THE WORST TRADE DEAL IN THE  HISTORY OF THE WORLD. WHAT IT HAS DONE TO NEW ENGLAND, BOY -- -SHE'S FOR RADICAL, UNLIMITED IMMIGRATION. I'M BUILDING A WALL AND SHE'S FOR, LIKE, COME ON ACROSS. SLIGHT DIFFERENCE.   A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL.  WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL? BY THE WAY, THEY MAY NOT KNOW IT  YET BUT IT THINK THEY'RE GETTING  THE IDEA.  BUT WHEN YOU THINK OF IT, SHE WANTS THE PEOPLE TOO POOR  ACROSS. THE BORDER CONTROL, THEY JUST  ENDORSED ME RECENTLY. AND LAST WEEK -- NEVER ENDORSED  A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BEFORE.  AND LAST WEEK -- THESE ARE  PEOPLE THAT WANT TO DO THEIR  JOBS BUT THEY ARE TOLD TO STAND  BACK. THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. IT WILL BE A LOT EASIER FOR THEM  IF THEY DO NOT ENDORSE ME  BECAUSE THEY COULD JUST TAKE IT  NICE AND EASY. WE HAVE A BORDER PATROL AGENTS,  WE HAD SHARE -- WE HAVE SHERIFF JOE FROM ARIZONA. HILLARY CLINTON HAS NOTHING. SHE WANTS PEOPLE TO POUR ACROSS  THE BORDERS. SHE WANTS THOUSANDS AND  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO COME IN  FROM SYRIA. I MEAN, 550% MORE THAN OUR PRESIDENT OBAMA. A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL  COMPLETELY RENEGOTIATE NAFTA. WE WILL WALK AWAY AND MAKE A BRAND-NEW DEAL WHICH IS FAR  BETTER WHERE ACTUALLY BUSINESSES START COMING TO PENNSYLVANIA AND TO OHIO.   UNBELIEVABLE. AND WE WILL STOP THE DISASTROUS TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP, WHICH  WILL BE ALMOST AS BAD AS NAFTA -- NOTHING COULD BE AS BAD BUT  WE WILL STOP IT AND MAKE DEALS.  THIS IS A COMPLEX DEAL WITH MANY  COUNTRIES. YOU HAVE TO SEE THE ARROWS A  LOADED A -- OVER THE PLACE. IT IS MORE THAN 5000 PAGES. IT'S A MESS.  I LIKE FREE TRADE.  WE MAKE ONE DEAL. IF THEY DO NOT BEHAVE, WE  TERMINATE THEM. WE SEND A NOTIFICATION OF  TERMINATION. BUT THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN BECAUSE DURING THE 30 DAY PERIOD  WE WILL RENEGOTIATE A BETTER  DEAL FOR OUR COUNTRY, OK? AND YOU CANNOT TERMINATE IT.  PEOPLE GO CRAZY. YOU HAVE TO BE A GRAND CHESSMASTER -- AND WE DO NOT  HAVE ANY OF THEM. CLINTON'S RADICAL CALL FOR OPEN  BORDERS, MEANING ANYONE CAN ENTER THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT  ANY LIMIT AT ALL, WOULD END THE UNITED STATES AS WE KNOW IT  TODAY. NO ONE WHO SUPPORTS OPEN BORDERS  SHOULD BE ABLE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE WE WILL NOT  HAVE A COUNTRY.   AND BY THE WAY, WEEKS  AGO I CALL THAT HILLARY CLINTON FOR SUPPORTING OPEN BORDERS AND THE MEDIA SAID I WAS WRONG. NOW, I HAVEN'T PROVEN RIGHT -- I  HAVE BEEN PROVEN RIGHT. WHERE IS THE MEDIA RUSHING TO DISPROVE THESE FALSE STORIES? I LIKE FREE TRADE BUT WE WANT  SMART TRADE. IT SHOULD NOT EVEN BE CALLED  FREE TRADE, AND SHOULD BE CALLED  SMART TRADE. I DO NOT LIKE THE TERM FREE  TRADE. BECAUSE FREE TRADE, TO HAVE IT  REALLY WORK, YOU NEED REALLY,  REALLY SMART PEOPLE NEGOTIATING  YOUR DETAILS. ALL THESE OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE  SMART PEOPLE. WE HAVE PEOPLE, THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.  NO LESS THAN BERNIE SANDERS  DECLARED THAT OPEN BORDERS WOULD  BE THE END OF AMERICA. BERNIE SANDERS SAID ""ARE'S MEANS THERE WOULD BE NO UNITED STATES. -- SAID ""BORDERS MEANS THERE  WOULD BE NO -- MAYBE THAT IS OK WITH HIM, NOT  OK WITH ME. BY THE WAY, HOW MANY WAYS CAN HILLARY CLINTON BETRAY BERNIE  SANDERS? EVEN IF WE DO NOT AGREE WITH  HIM, I MEAN -- BERNIE SANDERS  WOULD HAVE BEEN A LEGEND. HE WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN AS A  LEGENDARY FIGURE IN HISTORY IF  HE DID NOT MAKE A DEAL WITH THE  DEVIL. BUT HE MADE A DEAL WITH HER AND  NOW HE IS JUST ANOTHER GUY. SHE ATTACKED HAS -- HIS SUPPORTERS AS BASEMENT-DWELLERS. SHE IS IN FAVOR OF ENTITLEMENT CUTS AND AS FOR OPEN BORDERS AND  OPEN TRADE. YOUR STATE HAS LOST ONE IN THREE MANUFACTURING JOBS SINCE BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON'S NAFTA AND  CHINA DEALS HAPPEN. I AM GOING TO STOP FOR AN  CHEATING. THE PRODUCT DUMPING, WHICH BY  THE WAY IS KILLING THE STEEL INDUSTRY -- AND IT HAS ALREADY KILLED A MUCH OF YOUR STEEL INDUSTRY.  HOWDY PEOPLE AGREE WITH ME THAT CHINA -- WE'RE GOING TO BRING  THEM BACK, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.  HOW MANY PEOPLE AGREE WITH ME -- STUPID POLITICIANS WITH THE  KILLING OF THE STEEL INDUSTRY IN  PENNSYLVANIA.   BETWEEN THAT AND  CURRENCY REGULATION -- WHICH  THEY DO LIKE GRANDMASTER'S AND  WE DO LIKE WE'RE PLAYING BAD  GAMES OF CHECKERS.  WE ARE GOING TO START MAKING  THINGS IN AMERICA AGAIN AND WE  ARE GOING TO START MAKING THINGS  IN PENNSYLVANIA AGAIN. DO NOT LET THEM TELL YOU YOU ARE  DOING WELL BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING  LOUSY. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL WILL BUILD  OUR FUTURE AND PENNSYLVANIA ENERGY -- WE'RE BEINGING OUR MINERS BACK -- THEY'LL POWER OUR FUTURE. CONGRESSMAN, GET UP THERE. LOOK AT THIS GUY. I WILL TELL YOU, THEY SAY HE WAS A HELL OF A FOOTBALL PAIR. I DO NOT KNOW IF HE WOULD BE SO  GOOD TODAY. HE HAS BEEN SUCH AN INCREDIBLE SUPPORTER.  AND HE IS STUDYING -- STANDING  NEXT TO MY DAUGHTER, TIFFANY,  WHO CAME TODAY. THANK YOU, CONGRESSMAN. THANK YOU. WE HAVE SUCH GREAT SUPPORT. THAT INCLUDES CLEAN COAL, SHALE, OIL, AND NATURAL GAS WE HAVE TO  PROTECT. PENNSYLVANIA WORKERS WILL BE  HIRED TO DO THE JOB. HILLARY CLINTON WOULD RATHER  GIVE YOUR JOBS TO PEOPLE THAT  POUR INTO THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. I EXPLAINED HOW SHE FAVORS A 550% INCREASE IN SYRIAN REFUGEES  COMING INTO OUR LAND.  WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THEM. BY THE WAY, WE ALL HAVE -- WE  KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. EDITORIAL. WE WILL BUILD SAFE ZONES AND WE  WILL GET OTHERS TO PAY. THEY HAVE NOTHING BUT MONEY AND  THEY ARE NOT PUTTING UP THEIR  FAIR SHARE. THEY HAVE NOTHING BUT MONEY. THEY WILL PAY. WE WILL NEED THEM, BUT THEY WILL  PAY. I ALSO EXPOSED HOW HILLARY CLINTON IS PERSONALLY  RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RELEASE OF  THOUSANDS OF DANGEROUS CRIMINAL  ALIENS EUGENE NINE STATES. -- ALIENS INTO THE UNITED  STATES. SHE CANCELED VISAS, A DUTY VESTED IN HER BODY LAW, AND I  MUST TELL YOU SHE REFUSED TO USE FORCEFUL DIPLOMATIC ACTION. WE WILL HAVE A KILLER AND HE WILL BE FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY, LET'S SAY SOMEPLACE FROM SOUTH  AMERICA.  AND WE WILL CATCH HIM BECAUSE  OUR PEOPLE ARE GREAT AND  OUTBOARD OPRAH TRO -- OUR BORDER CONTROL PEOPLE ARE GREAT.  I WANT TO BRING THEM BACK TO WHATEVER COUNTRY TO COME FROM. A KILLER, A JUGULAR, A GANG MEMBER, THE HEAD OF A GANG. HILLARY CLINTON WOULD SAY WE  CANNOT FORCE THEM BACK INTO THE  COUNTRY.  THE HELL WE CAN'T.   I GUARANTEE YOU THAT  UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION THERE  WILL NOT BE ONE BAD GUY THAT IS NOT FORCED BACK INTO HIS  COUNTRY. NOT ONE.  THEY WILL NOT BE ANY.  YOU WILL NOT BE READING ABOUT  IT. WE WILL PUT SUCH PRESSURE ON  THESE COUNTRIES TO TAKE THESE  PEOPLE BACK.  BUT HILLARY CLINTON SAID -- I  SORRY MADAM SECRETARY, BUT THEY  WILL NOT TAKE THIS KILLER BACK.  WE WILL PUT SUCH PRESSURE ON  THESE COUNTRIES TO TAKE THESE  PEOPLE BACK.  OH, THAT'S OK. LET HIM BACK ON OUR STREETS.  AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS,  AND HONESTLY, IT WAS  BOTH VERY BEAUTIFUL AND VERY  SAD. REALLY, THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO  GET THEIR FEELINGS OUT FOR SO LONG AND THE MEDIA WOULD NOT  TAKE IT.  ONE THING WAS MADE, THE MEDIA  TAKES IT WITH WHATEVER -- ONE THING WITH ME, THE MEDIA TAKES  IT. ITALY KORAN -- SHE HAS BEEN STRUGGLING TO GET  THE MEDIA ATTENTION TO HER FOR  MANY YEARS. LAST NIGHT I DECIDED WE WOULD  EXPOSE THE HYPOCRISY OF THE CLINTONS AND THE MEDIA AND OUR  POLITICS TO THE ENTIRE WORLD.   AS I OUTLINED LAST NIGHT, BILL CLINTON WAS THE  WORST ABUSER OF WOMEN EVER TO SIT IN THE OVAL OFFICE. HE WAS A PREDATOR. HILLARY CLINTON SYSTEMATICALLY  ATTACKED AND DISCREDITED THE VICTIMS OF BILL CLINTON'S SEXUAL  HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT. THESE THINGS ARE NOT WRITTEN BY  THE MEDIA BUT THEY ARE TRUE. WRITTEN BY MANY BOOKS.  THESE VICTIMS INCLUDE NAMES LIKE KATHLEEN WILLEY, JUANITA  BRODERICK, PAULA JONES, CONNIE  HAMM Z, EILEEN WELLSTONE, SANDRA  ALLEN JAMES, AND CHRISTIE'S  SEARCH UP. THERE ARE MANY MORE. FOR DECADES HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN DEEPLY FAMILIAR WITH HER  HUSBAND'S PREDATORY BEHAVIOR AND  INSTEAD OF TRYING TO STOP IT,  SHE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EVEN MORE WOMEN. SHE PUT EVEN MORE WOMEN IN  HARM'S WAY WHEN SHE GOES OUT AND  SAYS I LOVE WOMEN, I'M GOING TO  HELP WOMEN. SHE IS A TOTAL HYPOCRITE. THE HYPOCRISY OF THE MEDIA AND OUR POLITICIANS IS HARD TO  BELIEVE. THEY CONDEMN MY WORDS BUT THEY IGNORE AND DEFEND THE REPRESENTS -- THIS IS THE WAY IT ISS -- THE REPRESENTABLE -- REPREHENSIBLE ACTS OF HILLARY AND BILL CLINTON. WHAT SHE DID AS A LAWYER WHEN  SHE WAS DEFENDING EMMANUEL -- A  MAN WHO RAPED A 12-YEAR-OLD  GIRL. DESPERATE TO WIN, HILLARY BLAMED THE 12-YEAR-OLD VICTIM. SHE WAS WITH US YESTERDAY. SHE WAS SITTING FRONT ROW AT THE  DEBATE. AS A LAWYER FOR   AS A LAWYER FOR THE RAPIST, SHE  SAID THE GIRL WAS UNSTABLE AND SAID SHE ENGAGED IN FANTASIZING. HILLARY RUINED THAT LITTLE GIRL'S LIFE AND YEARS LATER, SHE WAS RECORDED LAUGHING ABOUT IT ON VIDEOTAPE. THERE IS NOTHING HILLARY CLINTON  WON'T DO OR SAY TO OBTAIN POWER  AND IT IS ABOUT TIME PEOPLE  STARTED TO UNDERSTAND IT.  BUT THE HYPOCRITES IN THE MEDIA  DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT  HILLARY CLINTON HAS DONE TO  THESE VICTIMS. THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT  WHAT THEIR OTHER POLITICAL HEROES HAVE DONE TWO OTHER INNOCENT GIRLS AND WOMEN. PEOPLE LIKE KENNEDY, WE REMEMBER  THAT, DRIVING HIS CAR INTO A  POND INSTEAD OF CALLING THE  POLICE, POSSIBLY SAVING HER  LIFE. SHE WENT HOME AND WENT TO SLEEP, DID NOT REPORT THE INCIDENT TO  THE POLICE FOR 10 HOURS, YET HE  WAS HAILED AS A HERO. THE LAST 72 HOURS HAS FRAMED WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT. IT IS ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  FIGHTING BACK AGAINST CORRUPT  POLITICIANS THAT DON'T CARE  ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT  STAYING IN POWER AND KEEPING  THEIR DONORS HAPPY.  WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO EVERY  AMERICAN RIGHT NOW IS THAT I ACCEPT THE MANTLE OF THIS RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL OF US, FOR ALL OF US. WE HAVE AN ABSOLUTE INCREDIBLE SITUATION TAKING PLACE, FOLKS.  AND I WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING  FOR YOU AGAINST THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT THAT HAS BETRAYED  EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU,  BETRAYED THE COUNTRY. OUR GOVERNMENT HAS LOST ITS  VIRTUE. RIGHT NOW IT IS JUST ABOUT PROTECTING THE POWERFUL, AND YOU  KNOW WHAT I MEAN, AND I KNOW IT  BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE, AND  I'M DOING THIS BECAUSE I THINK  IT IS JUST SO DAMN UNFAIR.  EDIT IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO LEAD  TO THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR COUNTRY, AND WE ARE DOING IT. THE CLINTONS HAVE CORRUPTED OUR GOVERNMENT AT THE VERY HIGHEST LEVELS.  RANK AND FILE, INCREDIBLE  PEOPLE, BY THE WAY, INCREDIBLE PEOPLE, RANK AND FILE FBI AGENTS  ARE SHOCKED AT THE CORRUPTION  THERE WITNESSING AT LEVELS AT  THE FBI THAT NO ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOR  BILL CLINTON GETS IN THE BACK OF  AN AIRPLANE JUST 39 MINUTES PRIOR TO A DETERMINATION BEING  MADE. GET SOME WITH THE  -- GETS ON WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. JUST HAPPENED TO BE THERE. THERE IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. LET'S GET BACK ON THE PLANE. THEY SPENT 39 MINUTES IN THE  BACK OF THE PLANE.  A TALK ABOUT TWO THINGS. GOLF AND GRANDCHILDREN. 39 MINUTES. I GIVE THE GRANDCHILDREN FIVE MINUTES, I GIVE THE GULF THREE  MINUTES. WHAT ELSE DO YOU THINK THEY TALKED ABOUT? IN THE FBI, THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLE PEOPLE, THEY LOVE  THIS COUNTRY SO MUCH. THEY ARE SEEING THINGS THEY HAVE  NEVER SEEN BEFORE. GUILTY, GUILTY, GUILTY, GUILTY, NO CHARGE, NO PROBLEM. THEY SEE ALL THE STUFF GOING ON. THESE PEOPLE MUST BE SICK TO THEIR STOMACH. WHAT HAVE WE SEEN IN THE E-MAIL SCANDAL? WHAT HAVE WE SEEN IN THIRD WORLD  LEVEL CORRUPTION? THIS IS WHAT IT IS. WE ARE LIKE IN A THIRD WORLD  COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. AND THIS NOVEMBER IS OUR ONE  CHANCE, NOVEMBER 8, OUR ONE CHANCE TO SAVE OUR COUNTRY. IT IS THE LAST CHANCE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE, FOLKS.  I'VE TRAVELED AROUND THIS  COUNTRY TALKING ABOUT CHANGE. BUT MY TRAVELS, THE PLACES I  HAVE BEEN, THE PEOPLE I HAVE MET, THEY HAVE ALSO CHANGED ME. I AM NOT PROUD OF EVERYTHING I  HAVE DONE IN LIFE.  WHO AMONG US IS? IS ANYONE TOTALLY PROUD OF EVERY  SINGLE ELEMENT? LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I AM PROUD OF.  I AM PROUD THAT I ALWAYS TREATED  THE BLUE-COLLAR WORKER, AND I CONSIDER MYSELF IN A CERTAIN WAY  TO BE A BLUE-COLLAR WORKER, THAT MAKE THIS COUNTRY RUN WITH TREMENDOUS RESPECT. THE WAITERS AND WAITRESSES, THE  COPS AND FIREFIGHTERS, THE  RECEPTIONISTS AND CUSTODIANS, WE  TREAT THEM WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT.  THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE.  AND OUR POLICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS, WE HAVE  TO BE THANKFUL FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE DONE AN AMAZING JOB. I AM PROUD OF THE TENS OF  THOUSANDS OF JOBS I HAVE CREATED AND I AM PROUD THAT I PROVIDE  EQUAL PLAY AND EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK AND I HAVE TO DO  THAT. I HAVE TO DO THAT.  I HAVE PROMOTED WOMEN TO THE  HIGHEST POSITIONS IN OUR COUNTRY  OVER THE YEARS AND THEY HAVE  DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. I AM PROUD OF OUR UNBELIEVABLE MOVEMENT, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT  WE HAVE, A MOVEMENT. MEN AND WOMEN WHO ONLY WANT A  BETTER FUTURE FOR THEIR  CHILDREN.  THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT.  THAT IS WHAT WE WANT.  I KNOW THAT IF MY FATHER AND MY  MOTHER WERE ALIVE TODAY, THEY  WOULD BE VERY, VERY PROUD OF ME AND THEY WOULD BE PROUD OF  EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM AND ALL OF  THE OTHER STADIUMS AND ALL OF  THE OTHER ROOMS. WE HAVE THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN  THE WORLD.  THE GREATEST PEOPLE. AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA  GREAT AGAIN. IT IS GOING TO FACE UP AND THAT  IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN FAST, TOO,  I TELL YOU.  MY PARENTS KNEW WHAT WAS IN MY  HEART. THEY WOULD KNOW THE LOVE THAT I  HAVE FOR ALL THE HARD-WORKING  PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE LOVE I HAVE FOR MY COUNTRY  ITSELF. I'M GLAD I HAVE THE CHANCE TODAY  TO OPEN MY HEART TO ALL OF YOU AND TELL YOU HOW MUCH I WANT TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SO MUCH BETTER,  SO MUCH STRONGER, SO MUCH SAFER,  SO MUCH WEALTHIER. WE HAVE TO DO THOSE THINGS. A WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND SAID MR. TRUMP, SIR, LEAVE OUT  WEALTHY. CAN I USE RICH? NO, THAT DOES NOT SOUND GOOD. COMPANIES ALL OVER THE WORLD -- COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE  RIPPING OFF THE UNITED STATES. THEY ARE TAKING OUR WEALTH, THEY  ARE TAKING OUR FUTURE. WE WANT TO SAVE OUR WEALTH. WE WANT TO KEEP OUR TAXES AS LOW  AS POSSIBLE. RIGHT NOW THEY ARE FAR TOO HIGH. OUR TAXES ARE GOING TO BE CUT  MASSIVELY BY ME IF I GET IN AND  HILLARY IS GOING TO RAISE TAXES. OUR REGULATIONS, WHICH ARE  KILLING OUR COMPANIES, WHICH  WILL BE CUT MASSIVELY BY ME. YOU LOOK AT YOUR ENERGY COMPANIES, NATURAL GAS, YOUR COAL COMPANIES, YOU'RE STILL COMPANIES, THEY CAN'T COMPETE  WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD  BECAUSE THE REGULATIONS ARE SO HORRIBLE AND SO MASSIVE.  WE'RE GOING TO CUT TAXES. HILLARY IS GOING TO RAISE TAXES. WE ARE GOING TO CUT TAXES BIG-LEAGUE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. COMPANIES WILL BE ON OUR SHORES. IT WAS NOT BE LEAVING US FOR  MEXICO AND OTHER PLACES. WE WILL HAVE COMPANIES COMING  BACK AND NEW COMPANIES. IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN VERY  QUICKLY.  MY WHOLE LIFE I HAVE BEEN A  FIGHTER AND NOW I'M GOING TO  FIGHT FOR YOU.  WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT.  WE ARE TO BRING BACK OUR  MILITARY. OUR MILITARY NEEDS ENHANCEMENT. IT IS SO DEPLETED. WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT FOR OUR  VETERANS WHO ARE BEING HORRIBLY MISTREATED, NOT TAKEN CARE OF PROPERLY, IN MANY CASES, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE BEING TAKING CARE  OF MUCH BETTER THAN OUR  VETERANS.  WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR OUR  SECOND AMENDMENT, WHICH IS UNDER SIEGE.  WE ARE TO TAKE CARE OF THAT ONE  EASILY. WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT TO HAVE  SUPREME COURT JUSTICES THAT  BELIEVE OUR CONSTITUTION APPOINTED TO THE SUPREME COURT. WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR ALL OF  OUR BUSINESSES. WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR THOSE STALE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN  TAKEN AWAY FROM US.  WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR THOSE  MINERS. WHEN I WAS IN WEST VIRGINIA, I  MET INCREDIBLE PEOPLE AND A LOT  OF MINERS. I SAID TO THEM, DID YOU EVER  THINK OF MOVING TO ANOTHER AREA  AND GOING INTO ANOTHER PROFESSION?  THEY SAID MR. TRUMP, LIKE THEY  SAID, HELL NO. MR. TRUMP, WE LOVE BEING MINERS.  WE LOVE MINING. OUR PARENTS TO DO, OUR  GREAT-GRANDPARENTS DID IT. I RECOGNIZE THE LOVE THEY  HAD FOR MINING. HILLARY CLINTON SAID WE ARE  GOING TO CLOSE THE MINDS AND PUT THE MINERS OUT OF WORK. THEN SHE WENT TO WEST VIRGINIA  AND TRY TO CONVINCE THEM.  LET ME TELL YOU, FOLKS, WE'RE  GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR MINDS,  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE CLEAN  COAL. AND WE ARE TO PROTECT A GREAT NEW RESOURCE, SOMETHING THAT  OVER THE LAST FAIRLY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, HAS BECOME SO IMPORTANT. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP OUR PEOPLE WORKING AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE  A LOT MORE PEOPLE WORKING. WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE. WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF  COMMON CORE. WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR  EDUCATION LOCAL.  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE GREAT AND LASTING TRADE DEALS, NOT THE HORRIBLE TRADE DEALS.  THIS YEAR ON TRADE WE WILL HAVE ALMOST AN $800 BILLION TRADE  DEFICIT. THINK OF IT. WHO IS NEGOTIATING THE SEALS? IN OTHER WORDS, COUNTRYWIDE,  WITH CHINA WE ARE GOING TO LOSE ALMOST $500 MILLION. COUNTRYWIDE WE DO ALL THIS WORK.  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT OF ALMOST $800 BILLION. IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE, FOLKS.  WE ARE GOING TO TRADE. WE ARE GOING TO TRADE. WE ARE NOW GOING TO HAVE A TWO  LANE. HAVE A ONE-LANE SUPERHIGHWAY  GOING INTO MEXICO. HELLO. WE HAVE A ONE LANE HIGHWAY GOING  INTO MEXICO. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT A LITTLE WHILE TO GET SOME BACK A ONE-LANE COMING BACK BUT IT  ULTIMATELY IT WILL BE LIKE THIS. WE WANT TO BE FAIR. WE WILL BRINGS PENNSYLVANIA STEEL AND MANUFACTURING BACK. WE ARE TO UNLEASH TRILLIONS IN  NEW ENERGY AND WE WILL PUT OUR MINERS BACK TO WORK. WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT OUR  HUNTERS AND SAVE OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO DO BIG,  BIG DAMAGE. BIG DAMAGE TO THE SECOND AMENDMENT. WE ARE GOING TO FIX YOUR SCHOOLS  IN THE INNER-CITY AND REDUCE  CRIME AND POVERTY AND  JOBLESSNESS AND WE ARE GOING TO LEFT MILLIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AND MEXICANS FROM  POVERTY. WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH IS  UNBELIEVABLE. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE PENNSYLVANIA AND OHIO AND SO  MANY OTHER PLACES WITHIN OUR COUNTRY THE MANUFACTURING HUB OF  THE WORLD ONCE AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO  IT.  IT WILL NOT EVEN BE HARD TO DO.  BUT TO DO THESE THINGS WE MUST PUSH ASIDE THE POLITICIANS AND  THE SPECIAL INTERESTS WHO HAVE  BEEN FRAYED US -- WHO HAVE THE TRADE US. THIS YEAR, WE HAVE AN ELECTION  COMING UP ON NOVEMBER 8.

I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING SHE SAID.   I BEGAN THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE I   WAS SO TIRED OF SEEING SUCH FOOLISH THINGS HAPPEN TO OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS A GREAT COUNTRY, A   GREAT LAND.   I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF THAT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS AS A POLITICIAN.   I CANNOT BELIEVE I'M SAYING THAT ABOUT MYSELF BUT I GUESS I HAVE BEEN A POLITICIAN. AND MY WHOLE CONCEPT WAS TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WHEN I WATCH THE DEALS BEING   MADE, WHEN I WATCH WHAT'S   HAPPENING WITH SOME HORRIBLE THINGS LIKE OBAMA CARE WHERE YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE AND   HEALTH CARE IS GOING UP BY NUMBERS THAT ARE ASTRO NOMIBICAL, 68%, 79%, 71%, WHETHER I LOOK AT THE IRAN DEAL   AND HOW BAD IT IS FOR US IS,   IT'S A ONE-SIDED TRANSACTION WHERE WE'RE GIVE BACK $150 BILLION TO A TERRORIST STATE,   REALLY THE NUMBER ONE TERRORIST STATE, WE'VE MADE THEM A STRONG COUNTRY FROM A VERY WEAK COUNTRY JUST THREE YEARS AGO,   WHEN I LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS I   SEE AND ALL THE POTENTIAL OUR COUNTRY HAS, WE HAVE SUCH TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL, WHETHER IT'S IN BUSINESS AND TRADE,   WHERE WE'RE DOING SO BADDY.   LAST YEAR WE HAD AN ALMOST $800   BILLION TRADE DEFICIT.  IN OTHER WORDS, TRADING WITH   OTHER COUNTRIES WE HAD AN $800 BILLION DOIFMENTS IT'S HARD TO   COMBLEEVE -- ARE BELIEVE. INCONCEIVABLE. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE TRADE   DEARBLINGSS HAVE A STRONG   BORDER.   BRING BACK LAW AND ORDER THE JUST YESTERDAY, POLICE MEN WERE   SHOT, TWO KILLED.   THIS IS HAPPENING ON A WEEKLY BASIS.  WE HAVE TO BRING BACK RESPECT   TO LAW ENFORCEMENT.   AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE ON ALL   SIDES. WE NEED JUSTICE. BUT I WANT TO DO THINGS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN DONE INCLUDING FIX   OUR INNER CITIES AND MAKING THINGS BETTER FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN CITIZEN WHO   ARE SO GREAT AND THE LATINO   AMERICANS, THE HISPANICS. IT'S CALLED MAKE AMERICA GREAT   AGAIN. UCONN THANK YOU, MR. TRUMP.   THE QUESTION WAS ARE YOU BOTH MODELING POSITIVE AND   APPROPRIATE BEHAVIORS FOR   TODAY'S YOUTH. WE'VE RECEIVED A LOT OF QUESTIONS ONLINE ABOUT THE TAPES RELEASED FRIDAY. YOU DESCRIBED IT IT AS LOCKER   ROOM BANTER. YOU BRAGGED ABOUT GRABBING THEIR GENITALS. THAT IS SEXUAL ASSAULT  NO, I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS SASMEDE THIS WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I APOLOGIZE TO MY FAMILY AND TO   THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  CERTAINLY I'M NOT PROUD OF IT.  THIS IS LOCKER ROOM TALK AND WHEN YOU HAVE A WORLD WHERE   ISIS IS CHOPPING OFF HEADS, DROWNING PEOPLE IN STEEL   CAURGESS WHERE YOU HAVE WARS AND HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SIGHTS ALL OVER, WHERE YOU HAVE SO   MANY BAD THINGS HAPPENING THIS IS LIKE MEDIEVAL TIMES.   WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE   THIS, THE CARNAGE ALL OVER THE   WORLD.  AND THEY LOOK AND SEE -- CAN   YOU IMAGINE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE FRANKLY DOING SO WELL AGAINST   US WITH ISIS AND THEY LOOK AT OUR COUNTRY AND SEE WHAT'S   GOING ON? YES, I'M VERY EMBARRASSED BY   IT, I HATE IT BUT IT'S LOCKER   ROOM TALK AND ONE OF THOSE   THINGS.   I WILL KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF   ISIS. WE'RE GOING TO DEFEAT ISIS.   ISIS HAPPENED A NUMBER OF YEARS   AGO IN A VACUUM THAT WAS LEFT   BECAUSE OF BAD JUDGMENT AND I WILL TELL YOU I WILL TAKE CARE OF ISIS --  AND GET ON TO MUCH   MORE IMPORTANT AND BIGGER THINGS.  I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR WOMEN.  NOBODY HAS MORE --  FRANKLY, YOU HEAR THESE THINGS --  I HAVE TREMENDOUS   RESPECT FOR WOMEN AND NO, I HAVE NOT.   I WILL TELL YOU I'M GOING TO   MAKE THE COUNTRY SAFE, WE WILL   HAVE BORDERS WHICH WE DON'T   HAVE NOW.   PEOPLE ARE POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY, AND COMING FROM THE   MIDDLE EAST AND OTHER PLACES.   WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND GREAT AGAIN AND   MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T DO THAT, IT JUST -- IT SOUNDS HARSH TO   SAY BUT WE HAVE TO BUILD UP THE WEALTH OF OUR NATION. RIGHT NOW OTHER NATIONS ARE   TAKE OUR JOBS AND WEALTH --  AM I ALLOWED TO RESPOND TO THAT?  I ASSUME I AM.  IT'S JUST WORDS,   FOLKS.  JUST WORDS.   THOSE WORDS I'VE BEEN HEARING   THEM FOR MANY YEARS.  I HEARD THEM WHEN THEY WERE   RUNNING FOR SENATE IN NEW YORK   WHEN HILLARY WAS GOING TO BRING   BACK JOBS TO UPSTATE NEW YORK   AND SHE FAFMENTDE I'VE HEARD THEM WHEN HILLARY IS CONSTANTLY TALKING ABOUT THE INNER CITIES   OF OUR COUNTRY, WHICH ARE A DISASTER EDUCATION-WISE, JOB-WISE, SAFETY-WISE, EVERY WAY POSSIBLE.   I'M GOING TO HELP THE   AFRICAN-AMERICANS, I'M GOING TO   HELP THE LATINOS, HISPANICS, I   AM GOING TO HELP THE INNER   CITIES. SHE'S DONE A TERRIBLE JOB FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS. SHE WANTS THEIR VOTE AND SHE DOES NOTHING.   THEN SHE COMES BACK FOUR YEARS   LATER. WE SAW THAT FIRST HAND WHEN SHE WAS THE UNITED STATES SENATOR. SHE CAMPAIGNED --  SO SHE'S ALLOWED TO   DO THAT AND I'M NOT ALLOWED TO RESPOND?  SOUNDS FAIR.  AS I TOLD YOU, THAT WAS LOCKER ROOM TALK. I'M NOT PROUD OF IT.  I AM A PERSON WHO HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR PEOPLE, FOR MY   FAMILY, FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS   COUNTRY AND CERTAINLY I'M NOT   PROUD OF IT.  BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT   HAPPENED, IF YOU LOOK AT BILL CLINTON, MINE ARE WORDS AND HIS WERE ACTION. HIS WAS WHAT HE'S DONE TO WOMEN.  THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYBODY IN   THE HISTORY OF POLITICS IN THIS   NATION THAT'S BEEN SO ABUSIVE   TO WOMEN.   SO YOU CAN SAY IT ANY WAY YOU WANT TO SAY IT, BILL CLINTON   WAS ABUSIVE TO WOMEN.   HILLARY CLINTON ATTACKED THOSE   SAME WOMEN AND ATTACKED THEM   VICIOUSLY. FOUR OF THEM ARE HERE TONIGHT.  ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO IS A   WONDERFUL WOMAN AT 12 YEARS OLD WAS RAPED AT 12.  HER CLIENT, SHE REPRESENTED,   GOT HIM OFF AND SHE'S SEEN   LAUGHING ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS LAUGHING AT THE GIRL   WHO WAS RAPED. CATHY SHELTON, THAT YOUNG   WOMAN, IS HERE WITH US TONIGHT. SO DON'T TELL ME ABOUT WORDS. I AM ABSOLUTELY, I APOLOGIZE   FOR THOSE WORDS.  BUT IT IS THINGS THAT PEOPLE   SAY.  BUT WHAT PRESIDENT CLINTON DID,   HE WAS IMPEACHED, LOST HIS LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW, HE HAD TO PAY AN $850,000 FINE TO ONE OF THE WOMEN, PAULA JONES, WHO   IS ALSO HERE TONIGHT, AND I   WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN HILLARY BRINGS UP A POINT LIKE THAT AND   SHE TALKS ABOUT WORDS THAT I SAID 11 YEARS AGO, I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL AND I THINK SHE   SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HERSELF IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH.    WELL, YOU OWE THE   PRESIDENT AN APOLOGY BECAUSE AS   YOU KNOW VERY WELL, YOUR   CAMPAIGN, SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL,   HE'S ANOTHER REAL WINNER THAT   YOU HAVE, HE'S THE ONE THAT GOT THIS STARTED ALONG WITH YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER.   THEY WERE ON TELEVISION JUST TWO WEEKS AGO, SHE WAS, SAYING EXACTLY THAT. SO YOU REALLY OWE HIM AN   APOLOGY. YOU'RE THE ONE THAT SENT THE   PICTURES AROUND, YOUR CAMPAIGN   SENT THE PICTURES AROUND WITH   PRESIDENT OBAMA IN A CERTAIN   GARB.   THAT WAS LONG BEFORE I WAS EVER   INVOLVED.   SO YOU ACTUALLY OWE AN JIFMENT   NUMBER TWO, MICHELLE OBAMA. I'VE GOTTEN TO SEE THE COMMERCIALS THAT THEY DID ON   YOU AND I GOT TO SEE SOME OF   THE MOST VICIOUS COMMERCIALS I'VE EVER SEEN OF MICHELLE   OBAMA TALKING BUT, HILLARY. SO YOU TALK ABOUT FRIEND?   GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE COMMERCIALS. A RACE WHERE YOU LOST, FAIR AND SQUARE, UNLIKE THE BERNIE SANDERS RACE WHERE YOU WON BUT   NOT FAIR AND SQUARE IN MY   OPINION. AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE   A LOOK AT WIKILEAKS AND SEE WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS AND SEE WHAT DEBORAH WASSERMAN SCHULTZ -- SCHULTZ HAD IN MIND BECAUSE BETWEEN HER   AND SUPER DELEGATES, BERNER   SANDERS NEVER HAD A CHANCE.   I WAS SO SURPRISED TO SEE HIM   SIGN ON WITH THE DEVIL. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT APOLOGIZING   THE THING YOU SHOULD BE JIGSE   FOR ARE THE 33,000 EMAILS THAT   YOU DELETED AND THAT YOU   ACID-WASHED AND THEN THE TWO BOXES OF EMAILS AND OTHER THINGS LAST WEEK THAT WERE   TAKEN FROM AN OFFICE AND ARE   NOW MISSING AND I'LL TELL YOU   WHAT, I THINK -- I DIDN'T THINK   I'D SAY THIS BUT I'M GOING TO SAY IT AND I HATE TO SAY IT BUT IF I WIN, I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR SITUATION   BECAUSE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SO MANY LIES, SO MANY DECEPTION,   THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING   LIKE IT AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE   A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.   WHEN I SPEAK, I GO OUT AND SPEAK, THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE FURIOUS.  IN MY OPINION, THE PEOPLE THAT   HAVE BEEN LONG-TERM WORKERS AT   THE F.B.I. ARE FURIOUS.   THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING   LIKE THIS WHERE EMAILS AND YOU   GET EAU SUBPOENA, YOU GET A   SUBPOENA AND AFTER GETTING THE   SUBPOENA YOU DELETE 33,000   EMAILS. AND THEN YOU ACID WASH THEM OR   BLEACH THEM AS YOU WOULD SAY, A VERY EXPENSIVE PROCESS.   SO WE'RE GOING TO GET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR AND WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW   WHAT?   PEOPLE HAVE BEEN, THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED FOR DOING   ONE FIFTH OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE   AND IT'S A DISGRACE. HONESTLY YOU OUGHT TO BE   ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.  BECAUSE YOU WOULD BE   IN JAIL.  AND YET SHE DIDN'T   KNOW THE LETTER C ON A   DOCUMENT, RIGHT?  SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT LETTER MEANT?   YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING. I'M WATCHING HILLARY GO OVER FACTS AND SHE'S GOING FACT   AFTER FACT AND SHE'S LYING AGAIN BECAUSE SHEE -- SHE SAID   SHERKS WHAT SHE DID WITH THE   EMAILS WAS FINE. YOU THINK IT WAS FINE TO DELETE 33,000 EMAILS?  I DON'T THINK SO. SHE SAID THE 33,000 HAD TO DO   WITH YOUR DAUGHTER'S WEDDING,   NUMBER ONE AND A YOGA CLASS.  MAYBE WE'LL GIVE THREE OR FOUR   OR FIVE. 33,000 DELETED AND NOW SHE'S   SAYING THERE WASN'T ANYTHING   WRONG. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THAT WAS   AFTER GETTING A SUBPOENA.   NOT ABOUT.  SHE GOT IT FROM THE UNITED   STATES CONGRESS AND I'LL BE   HONEST, I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN CONGRESSMEN, INCLUDING REPUBLICANS, FOR ALLOWING THIS TO HAPPEN. OUR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHERE   HER HUSBAND GOES ONTO THE BACK OF AN AIRPLANE 39 MINUTES,   TALKS TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, DAYS BEFORE A RULING IS GOING TO BE MADE ON HER CASE. BUT FOR YOU TO SAY THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU DELETING 39,000 I MAILS ARE, AGAIN YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.   WHAT  LET ALONE AFTER   GETTING A SUBPOENA FROM THE CONGRESS.  YOU DIDN'T DELETE THEM?  AND GET OFF THIS  I'D LIKE TO KNOW, ANDERSON, WHY AREN'T YOU BRING   UP THE EMAILS?  NO, IT HASN'T. NOT AT ALL. NICE, ONE ON THREE.  NO, I'M A GENTLEMAN.   GO AHEAD,  IT'S JUST -- SUCH A GREAT QUESTION AND THE QUESTION I GET ALMOST MORE THAN ANYTHING   ELSE OUTSIDE OF DEFENSE.  OBAMA CARE IS A DISASTER. YOU ALL KNOW IT. WE KNOW IT. IT'S GOING UP AT NUMBERS NOBODY   HAS EVEN WORLDWIDE.   IT'S ONLY GETTING WORSE.  IN 17 IT IMPLODES BY ITSELF.  THEIR METHOD OF FIXING IT IS TO GO BACK AND ASK CONGRESS FOR   MORE AND MORE MONEY.  RIGHT NOW WE'RE ALMOST $20 TRILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT. OBAMA CARE WILL NEVER WORK.   IT'S VERKS VERY BAD HEALTH INSURANCE, FAR TOO EXPENSIVE   AND NOT ONLY FOR THE PERSON WHO HAS IT, UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE   FOR OUR COUNTRY.  IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE   BIGGEST LINE ITEMS VERY SHORTLY.  WE HAVE TO REPEAL IT AND PRE --   REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE   AND SOMETHING THAT WORKS WHERE   YOUR PLAN CAN ACTUALLY BE TAILORED.   WE HAVE TO GET RIRVED THE BE   LINES AROUND THE STARKTSE   ARTIFICIAL LINES WHERE WE STOP INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM COMING   IN AND COMPETING BECAUSE   PRESIDENT OBAMA AND WHOEVER WAS   WORKING ON IT WANTS TO LEAVE   THOSE BECAUSE THAT GIVES THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ESSENTIALLY MONOPOLIES.   WE WANT COMPETITION. YOU WILL HAVE THE FINEST HEALTH CARE PLAN THERE IS. SHE WANTS TO GO TO SINGLE   PAYER, WHICH WOULD BE A   DISASTER. SOMETHING STHROOR CANADA. IF YOU EVER NOTICED CANADIANS  -- CANADIANS, WHEN THEY NEED A   BIG OPERATION OR SOMETHING HAPPENS, THEY COME INTO THE UNITED STATES IN MANY CASES BECAUSE THEIR SYSTEM IS SO SLOW, IT'S CATASTROPHIC IN MANY   WAYS. SHE WANTS TO GO TO SINGLE PAYER   WHICH MEANS THE GOVERNMENT   BASICALLY RULES EVERYTHING.   HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN AFTER   THIS FOR YEARS. OBAMA CARE WAS THE FIRST STEP.  IT'S A TOTAL DISASTER AND NOT   ONLY ARE YOUR RATES GOING UP BY NUMBERS THAT NOBODY'S EVER BELIEVED, BUT YOUR DEDUCTIBLES   ARE GOING UP SO THAT UNLESS YOU   GET HIT BY A TRUCK, YOU ARE   NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE   IT. IT'S A DISASTROUS PLAN AND HAS   TO BE REPEALED AND REPLACED.  ONE THING.   FIRST OF ALLING SEVERING BROKEN   ABOUT IT. BERNIE SANDERS SAID HILLARY   CLINTON HAS VERY BAD JUM.   THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF   IT, TRYING TO SAVE OBSERVE A.M.AH -- OBAMA CARE.  I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT MEANS. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PLANS THAT ARE SO GOOD, BECAUSE ONCE WE   HAVE COMPETITION IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY -- YUKES GOING TO HAVE A MANDATE THAT AMERICANS HAVE HEALTH  EXCUSE ME.   PRESIDENT OBAMA BY KEEPING   THOSE BOUNDARY LINES AROUND EACH STARKTSE AND IT WAS ALMOST GONE UNTIL JUST RIGHT TOWARD THE END OF 69 PASSAGE OF OBAMA   CARE WHICH BY THE WAY WAS A   FRAUD, YOU KNOW THAT.   JONATHAN GRUBER, THE ARCHITECT   OF OBAMA CARE, HE SAID IT WAS A GREAT LIKE, A BIG LIE.  PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID YOU KEEP YOUR DOCTOR, KEEP YOUR PLAN.  THE WHOLE THING WAS A FRAUD AND   DOESN'T WORK BUT WHEN YOU GET   RID OF THOSE LINES YOU KEEP   COMPETITION, WE WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP PREEXISTING AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO HELP PEOPLE THAT CAN'T   GET, DON'T HAVE MONEY. REPUBLICANS FEEL THIS WAY AND   BELIEVE IT OR NOT, STRONGLY THIS WAY WE'RE GOING TO BLOCK   GRANT INTO THE STATES, INTO MICKED AIDE INTO THE STATES SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF   PEOPLE WITHOUT THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES 78  WELL, YOU ARE RIGHT   ABOUT ISLAMO PHOBE YEA AND   THAT'S A SHAPE. BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE, THERE   IS A PROBLEM. WHO WE LIKE IT OR NOT, THERE IS A PROBLEM AND WE HAVE TO BE   SURE THAT MUSLIMS COME IN AND REPORT WHEN THEY SEE SOMETHING GOING ON.   WHEN THEY SEE HATRED GOING ON,   THEY HAVE TO REPORT IT.   AS AN EXAMPLE, IN SAN BERNARDINOO, MANY PEOPLE SAW THE BOMBS ALL OVER THE APORT -- APARTMENT OF THE TWO PEOPLE WHO KILLED AND WOUNDED SO MANY PEOPLE.   MUSLIMS HAVE TO REPORT THE   PROBLEMS WHEN THEY SEE THEM. THERE IS ALWAYS A REASON FOR   EVERYTHING THE IF THEY DON'T DO THAT, IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR OUR COUNTRY   BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT ORLANDO,   AND YOU LOOK AT SAN BERNARDINO AND AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER,   GO OUTSIDE, LOOK AT PARIS, THAT   HORRIBLE -- THESE ARE RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS AND SHE   WON'T EVEN MENTION THE WORD NOR   WILL PRESIDENT OBAMA. HE WON'T USE THE TERM RADICAL   ISLAMIC TERRORISM.  NOW, TO SOLVE A PROBLEM, YOU   HAVE TO BE ABLE TO STATE WHAT   THE PROBLEM IS OR AT LEAST SAY THE NAME.   SHE WON'T SAY THE NAME AND   PRESIDENT OBAMA WON'T SAY THE NAME.   BUT THE NAME IS THERE. IT'S RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR.  AND BEFORE YOU SOLVE IT YOU   HAVE TO SAY THE NAME.  FIRST OF ALL, CAPTAIN KHAN IS AN AMERICAN   HERO AND IF I WERE PRESIDENT AT THAT TIME HE WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY BECAUSE UNLIKE HER, WHO VOTED FOR THE WAR WITHOUT   KNOWING WHAT SHE WAS DOING, I   WOULD NOT HAVE HAD OUR PEOPLE   IN IRAQ. IRAQ WAS A DISASTER. SO HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ALIVE TODAY. THE MUSLIM BAN IS SOMETHING THAT IN SOME FORM HAS MORPHED INTO EXTREME VETTING FROM   CERTAIN AREAS OF THE WOMPLTD HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO ASLOW  --  YOU YOU INTERRUPT ME   ALL THE TIME. WHY DON'T YOU INTERRUPT HER?  IT'S CALLED EXTREME VETTING.  WE ARE GOING TO AREAS LIKE   SYRIA WHERE THEY'RE COMING IN   BY THE TENS OF THOUSANDS BECAUSE OF BARACK OBAMA AND   HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO ALLOW A 550% INCREASE OVER OBAMA, PEOPLE ARE COMING INTO OUR   COUNTRY, LIKE WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE, WHERE THEY'RE   FROM, WHAT THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT OUR COUNTRY IS AND SHE WANTS 550% MORE.  THIS IS GOING TO BE THE GREAT TROJAN HORSE OF ALL TIME.   WE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS IN THIS COUNTRY.  I BELIEVE IN BUILDING SAFE ZONES.  I BELIEVE IN HAVING OTHER PEOPLE PAY FOR THEM.  AS AN EXAMPLE, THE GULF STATES WHO ARE NOT CARRYING THEIR   WEIGHT BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING BUT MONEY AND TAKE CARE OF   PEOPLE. BUT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE WITH   ALL THE PROBLEMS THIS COUNTRY HAS AND ALL OF THE PROBLEMS YOU   SEE GOING ON, HUNDREDS OF   THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COMING IN FROM SYRIA WHEN WE KNOW NOTHING   ABOUT THEM, WE KNOW NOTHING   ABOUT THEIR VALUES AND NOTHING   ABOUT THEIR LOVE FOR OUR COUNTRY.  HAS NOT BEEN DEBUNKED. AND YOU VOTED FOR IT AND YOU   SHOULDN'T HAVE.  SHE JUST WENT ABOUT   235 SECONDS OVER HER TIME.  COULD YOU SHALL I JUST RESPOND TO THIS PLEASE? HILLARY CLINTON -- WE HAVE MANY CRIMINALS COME INTO THE COUNTRY.  WE WANT TO ACCEPTED THEM BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY AND MANY CASES THEY SAY WE DON'T WANT THEM.  HILLARY CLINTON AS SECRETARY OF   STATE SAID WE CANT -- CAN'T   FORCE THEM RIGHT BACK INTO   THEIR COUNTRIES. LET ME TELL YOU, I'M GOING TO FORCE THEM RIGHT BACK.  AND WHEN BERNIE SANDERS SAYS SHE HAS BAD JUDGMENT, SHE HAS   REALLY BAD JUDGMENT.  SHE'S LETTING PEOPLE IN,   LETTING DRUGS POUR THROUGH OUR SOUTHERN BORDER AT A RECORD   CLIP AND IT SHOULDN'T BE   ALLOWED TO HAPPEN. I C. -- I.C.E. JUST ENDORSED MECHE THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS. 16,000 OF THEM RECENTLY ENDORSED ME AND THEY DID IT BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE   BORDER. SHE DOESN'T.  SHE WANTS AMNESTY FOR EVERYBODY.  COME RIGHT IN, COME ON OVER.  IT'S A HORRIBLE THING AND SHE'S   GOT BAD JUDGMENT AND SO BAD   THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER BE   PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.  I THINK I SHOULD RESPOND BECAUSE IT'S SO RIDICULOUS.   LOOK, NOW SHE'S BLAMING -- SHE GOT CAUGHT IN A TOTAL LIE. HER PAPERS WENT OUT TO ALL HER FRIENDS AT THE BANKS, GOLDMAN SACHS AND EVERYBODY ELSE AND   SAID THINGS, WIKILEAKS JUST   CAME OUT AND SHE LIED AND NOW SHE'S BLAMING THE LIE ON THE   LATE, GREAT ABRAHAM LINK ON.  THAT'S ONE I HAVE -- OK. HONEST ABE NEVER LIED.  THAT'S THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LINCOLN AND UP.   BIG, BIG DIFFERENCE.  WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME   DIFFERENCE. BUT AS FAR AS OTHER ELEMENTS OF WHAT SHE'S SAYING, I DON'T KNOW   PUTIN.  I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE   GOT ALONG WITH RUSSIA BECAUSE   WE COULD FIGHT ICY TOGETHER AS   AN EXAMPLE BUT I DON'T KNOW PUTIN.  BUT I NOTICE ANY TIME ANYTHING   WRONG HAPPENS THEY LIKE TO SAY   IT'S THE RUSSIANED.   THEY DON'T KNOW BUT THEY ALWAYS BLAME RUSSIA BECAUSE THEY THINK   THEY'RE TRYING TO TARNISH ME   WITH RUSSIA.  I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT RUSSIA --   I KNOW ABOUT RUSSIA BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE INNER WORKINGS   OF RUSSIA.  I HAVE NO BUSINESS THERE, NO   LOANS FROM RUSSIA.  I HAVE A VERY, VERY GREASE   BALANCE SHEET, SO GREAT THAT WHEN I DID THE OLD POST OFFICE   BUILDING ON PENNSYLVANIA   AVENUE, THE UNITED STATES GOLF   CHOSE ME TO DO THE OLD POST OFFICE BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND CONGRESS.   ONE OF THE PRIMARY THINGS, IN   FACT THE PRIMARY THING WAS   BALANCE SHEET.  BUT I HAVE NO LOANS WITH   RUSSIA. YOU COULD GO TO THE UNITED   STATES GOVERNMENT AND THEY WOULD PROBABLY TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE THEY KNOW MY SHEET VERY WELL IN ORDER TO GET THAT DEVELOPMENT I HAD TO HAVE. THE TAXES ARE A VERY SIMPLE THING.  FIRST OF ALL, I PAY HUNDREDS OF   MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAXED. MANY OF HER FRIENDS TOOK BIGGER   DEDUCTIONS.   WARREN BUFF -- BUFFETT TOOK A   MASSIVE DEDUCTION.  OR OS. MANY OF THE PEOPLE GIVE HER ALL   THIS MONEY SO SHE CAN DO MANY MORE COMMERCIALS THAN ME, GAVE HER -- THEY TOOK MASSIVE DEDUCTIONS.   SOON AS MY ROUTINE AUDIT IS   DONE, I'LL BE PROUD TO RELEASE   MY RETURNS.  NO.  P BUT I PAY TAXES. THE WRITEOFF IS A WONDERFUL   THING. SHE'S GIVEN IT TO US.   IF SHE HAY PROBLEM, FOR 30   YEARS SHE'S BEEN DOING THIS. I SAY THAT ALL THE TIME. SHE'S BEEN TALK ABOUT HEALTH   CARE, WHY DIDN'T SHE DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT?  SHE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT   ANYTHING 0 OTHER THAN TAUFPBLGT WITH HER ATS ALL TALK, NO ACTION. AND AGAIN, BERNIE SANDERS, IT'S   REALLY BAD JUDGMENT.  SHE HAS MADE BAD JUDGMENT NOT   ONLY ON TAXES, BAD JUDGMENTS ON LIBYA, SYRIA, ON IRAQ. HER AND OBSERVE AMA, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.   THE WAY THEY GOT OUT OF IRAQ,   THE VACUUM THEY LEFT THAT'S WHY   ISIS FORMED IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEY STARTED FROM THAT LITTLE   AREA AND NOW THEY'RE IN 32 DIFFERENT NATIONS. HILLARY.  CONGRATULATIONS. GREAT JOB.  WHY DIDN'T YOU DO  SHE SAID A LOT OF   THINGS --  SHE WAS THERE WITH THE SO-CALLED LINE IN THE SAND  --  SADLY, PRESIDENT OBAMA PROBABLY LISTENED TO YOU. I DON'T THINK HE WOULD BE ANY MORE.   THE LINE IN THE SAND WAS   LAUGHED AT ALL OVER THE WORLD   WITH WHAT HAPPENED.   THAT BEING SAID, SHE TALKS TOUGH AGAINST RUSSIA BUT OUR   NUCLEAR PROGRAM HAS FALLEN WAY   BEHIND AND THEY'VE GONE WILD WITH THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM. NOT GOOD.   OUR GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T HAVE   ALLOWED THAT TO HAPPEN.   RUSSIA IS NEW IN TERMS OF NUCLEAR.  WE'RE OLD, TIRED, EXHAUSTED IN   TERMS OF NUCLEAR. A VERY BAD THING. NOW, SHE TALKS TOUGH. SHE TALKS REALLY TOUGH AGAINST PUTIN. AND AGAINST ASSAD. SHE TALKS IN FAVOR OF THE REBELS.   SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHO THE   REBELS ARE THE YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME WE TAKE REBELS, WHETHER   IT'S IN IRAN -- IRAQ OR   ANYWHERE ELSE WE'RE ARMING PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS?  THEY END UP BEING WORSE ON THE  -- THAN THE PEOPLE.   LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN LIBYA.  IT'S A MESS. AND ISIS HAS A GOOD CHUNK OF THEIR OIL.  YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD THAT.   IT WAS A DISASTER BECAUSE ALMOST EVERYTHING SHE'S DEMUN FOREIGN POLICY HAS BAIN MISTAKE   AND I DISASTER.   BUT IF YOU LOOK AT RUSSIA AND   LOOK AT WHAT THEY DID THIS WEEKING WHERE I AGREE, SHE   WASN'T THERE BUT POSSIBLY SHE'S   CONSULTED. WE SIGN A PEACE TREATY.   EVERYONE IS ALL EXCITED BUT WHAT RUSSIA DID, WITH ASSAD AND   BY THE WAY WITH IRAN, WHO YOU MADE VERY POWERFUL WITH THE   DUMBEST DEAL I HAVE EVER SEEN   IN THE HISTORY OF DEAL MAKING,   THE IRAN DEAL WITH THE $1.7 MILLION IN CASH, ENOUGH TO FILL   UP THIS ROOM, BUT LOOK AT THAT DEAL.   THE IRAN NOW AND RUSSIA ARE NOW   AGAINST US. SO SHE WANTS TO FIGHT.  SHE WANTS TO FIGHT FOR RERNLS  -- REBELS. THERE IS ONLY ONE PROBLEM.  YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THE   REBELS ARE THE  I DON'T LIKE ASSAD AT ALL BUT RUSSIA IS KILLING ISIS, ASSAD IS KILLING ISIS AND   IRAN AND THOSE THREE HAVE NOW   LINED UP BECAUSE OF OUR WEAK FOREIGN POLICY.  OK. HE AND I HAVEN'T SPOKEN AND I DISAGREE. YOU HAVE TO KNOCK OUT ISIS. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO   FIGHT BOTH AT THE SAME TIME BY  -- BUT SYRIA IS NOT ANY LONGER   SIR YALT IT'S IRAN, WHICH SHE   AND THE DEAL MADE INTO A VERY   POWERFUL NATION VERY QUICKLY  WE HAVE TO GET ICE, WE HAVE TO   BEFORE WE GET TOO MUCH MORE INVOLVED SHE HAD A CHANCE TO DO   SOMETHING WITH SYRIA.   THAT BECAUSE THE LINE.  I THINK IT BASICALLY HAS FALLEN, OK?   LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. TAKE A LOOK AT MOSUL. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE STUPIDITY OF OUR FOREIGN   POLICY, WE HAVE MOSUL, THEY   THINK A LOT OF THE ISIS LEADERS ARE THERE. SO WE HAVE ANNOUNCEMENTS COMING OUT, WE WILL BE ATTACKING MOSUL   IN THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AND ALL   THESE BAD LEADERS FROM ISIS ARE LEAVING MOSUL.  WHY CAN'T THEY DO IT QUIETLY,   MAKE IT A SNEAK ATTACK AND   AFTER THE ATTACK IS MADE INFORM   THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT WE'VE   KNOCKED OUT LEADERS, HAD A   TREMENDOUS SUCCESS?   WHY DO THOFE SAY WE'RE GOING TO BE ATTACKING MOSUL IN THE NEXT   FOUR TO SIX WEEKS?  HOW STUPID OUR COUNTRY?  LOOK, I HAVE 20OGENS AND ADMIRALS WHO ENDORSED ME.   21 CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENTS ENDORSE ME.  WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME. THEY UNDERSTAND, WHY CAN'T THEY DO SOMETHING SECRETIVELY WHERE THEY GO IN AND THEY KNOCK OUT THE LEADERSHIP? WHY WOULD THESE PEOPLE STAY THERE?  I'VE BEEN READING ABOUT MOSUL THAT IT'S THE HARBOR WHERE, THIS IS WHERE THEY THINK THE ISIS LEADERS ARE. WHY WOULD BE -- THEY BE STAYING THERE ANY SENATOR THEY'RE GONE. EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT HOW IRAQ, WHICH IS US WITH OUR LEADERSHIP, GOES IN TO FIGHT MOSUL.  NOW, WITH THESE 200 ADD MIRALS   AND GENERALS, THEY CAN'T   BELIEVE IT. ALL I SAY IS THIS, GENERAL PATTON AND GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR ARE SPINNING IN THEIR   GRIEVE -- GRAVE WITH THE   STUPIDITY OF WHAT WE'RE DOING   IN THE MIDDLE 5E6789  SHE GOES ONE MINUTE   OVER AND YOU DON'T STOP HER.  I GO ONE SECOND OVER AND YOU   STOP ME.  ABSOLUTELY. SHE CALLS OUR PEOPLE DEPLORABLE.   A LARGE GROUP.  AND IRREDEEMABLE.   I WILL BE A PRESIDENT FOR ALL   OF OUR PEOPLE AND I'LL BE A   PRESIDENT THAT WILL TURN OUR   INNER CITIES AROUND AND WILL   GIVE STRENGTH TO PEOPLE AND   WILL GIVE ECONOMICS TO PEOPLE   AND WILL BRING JOBS BACK BECAUSE NASTA, SIGNED BY HER   HUSBAND, IS PERHAPS THE GREATEST DISASTER TRADE DEAL IN   THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.   NOT OF THIS COUNTRY. IT STRIPPED US OF MANUFACTURING   JOBS. WE LOST OUR JOBS.   WE LOST OUR MONEY.  WE LOST OUR PLANTS.   IT IS A ZAFMENT AND NOW SHE WANTS TO SIGN T.P.P. EVEN   THOUGH NOW SHE SAYS, SHE'S FOR IT, CALLED IT THE GOLD   STANDARD. AT THE LAST DEBATE SHE LIED,   SAID SHE DIDN'T SAY IT'S THE   GOLD STANDARD. SHE LIED BUT SHE'S LIED BAY LOT   OF THINGS. I WOULD BE A PRESIDENT FOR ALL   OF THE PEOPLE. AFRICAN-AMERICANS, THE INNER CITIES.   DEVASTATING WHAT'S HAPPENING TO   OUR INNER CITIES.   SHE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR   YEARS. AS USUAL, SHE TALKS ABOUT IT,   KNOWLEDGE HAPPENS. SHE DOESN'T GET IT DONE. SAME WITH THE LATINO AMERICANS,   THE HISPANIC AMERICANS, THE   SAME EXACT THING.   THEY TALK.  THEY DON'T GET IT DONE.   YOU GO INTO THE INNER CITIES   AND YOU SEE IT'S 45% POVERTY. AFRICAN-AMERICANS NOW 45% POVERTY IN THE INNER CITIES. THE EDUCATION IS A ZAFMENT JOBS   ARE ESSENTIALLY NONEXISTENT.  I MEAN IT'S, YOU KNOW, AND I'VE   BEEN SAYING IT, BIG SPEECHES WHERE I HAVE 20,000 AND 30,000   PEOPLE, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO   LOSE? IT CAN'T GET ANY WORSE.   SHE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE   INNER CITIES FOR 25 YEARS.  NOTHING IS GOING TO EVER   HAPPEN.   LET ME TELL YOU, IF SHE'S PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN.   JUST TALK AND ALL HER FRIENDS,   THE TAXED WE WERE TALKING   ABOUT, I WOULD GET IT BY OSMOSIS.  SHE'S NOT DOING ME FAVORS BUT BY DOING ALL THE OTHERS FAVORS,   SHE'S DOING ME FAVORS. BUT I WILL TELL YOU SHE'S ALL   TAUFPBLGT IT DOESN'T GET DONE.  TAKE A LOOK AT HER SENATE RUN AND UPSTATE NEW YORK.   IT TURNED OUT TO BE A DISASTER  WE HAVE A DIVIDE NATION.   WE HAVE A VERY DIVIDED NATION.  YOU LOOK AT CHARLOTTE, BOORGES THE VIOLENCE TAKING PLACE IN   THE INNER CITIES. CHICAGO.  YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WASHINGTON, D.C., WE HAVE AN INCREASE IN   MURDER WITHIN OUR CITIES MUCH THE BIGGEST IN 45 YEARS. WE HAVE A DIVIDED NATION BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE  AND THIS COUNTRY   CANNOT TAKE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF BARACK OBAMA AND THAT'S WHAT   YOU ARE GETTING WITH HER.  NO.  IT WASN'T CHECK OUT A SEX TAPE.   IT WAS SO SEE TAKE A LOOK -- BY THE WAY, WHEN SHE SAID 3:00 IN THE MORNING, TAKE A LOOK AT BENGHAZI.   SHE SAID WHO IS GOING TO TAKE   THE CALL AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING?  SHE DIDN'T ANSWER IT. AMBASSADOR STEVENS, 600 TIMES  -- SHE SAID SHE WAS AWAKE AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING AND I --   SHE SENT A TWEET OUT AT 3:00. BUT THE FAMOUS THING, WHO IS   GOING TO ANSWER AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING?  GUESS WHAT HAPPENED? AMBASSADOR STEVENS SENT 600 REQUESTS FOR HELP AND THE ONLY   ONE SHE TALKED TO AS SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL, WHO'S HER FRIEND   AND NOT A GOOD GUY, BY THE WAY. SO YOU KNOW, SHE SHOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT THAT. NOW, TWEETING HAPPENS TO BE A   MODERN-DAY FORM OF COMMUNICATION.  UB -- COMMUNICATION. YOU CAN LIKE IT OR NOT LIKE IT.   BETWEEN FACEBOOK AND TWITTER I HAVE ALMOST 25 MILLION PEOPLE.  IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY OF   COMMUNICATION. YOU CAN PUT IT DOWN BUT IT'S A   VERY EFFECTIVE FORM BE   COMMUNICATION. I'M NOT UNPROUD OF IT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.  I'M SHOCKED TO HEAR   THAT.    THE LOWEST GROWTH SINCE 1929.  JUSTICE SCALIA, GREAT JUDGE, D-DAY RECENTLY. AND WE HAVE -- DIED RECENTLY AND WE'VE A VACANCY.  I AM LOOKING TO APPOINT JUDGES   VERY MUCH IN THE MOLD OF JUSTICE SKALIA.   I'M LOOKING FOR JUDGES AND I HAVE ACTUALLY PICKED 20 OF THEM   SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD SEE. HIGHLY RESPECTED.   HIGHLY THOUGHT OF AND ACTUALLY VERY BEAUTIFULLY REVIEWED BY   JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY.   BUT PEOPLE THAT WILL RESPECT   THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.   AND I THINK THAT THIS IS SO IMPORTANT, ALSO THE SECOND   AMENDMENT WHICH IS TOTALLY   UNDER SIEGE BY PEOPLE LIKE HILLARY CLINTON. THEY'LL RESPECT THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND WHAT IS STANDS   FOR, WHAT IT REPRESENTS.  SO IMPORTANT TO ME.   HILLARY MENTIONED SOMETHING   ABOUT CONTRIBUTIONS. JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND, SO I   WILL HAVE IN MY RACE MORE THAN   1 -- $100 MILLION OF MY MONEY, MEANING I'M NOT TAKING ALL THIS BIG MONEY FROM ALL THESE DIFFERENT CORPORATIONS LIKE   SHE'S DOING. I'M PUTTING IN MORE BY THE TIME IT'S FINISHED, MORE THAN $100 MILLION INVESTED.   PRETTY MUCH SELF FUNDED. WE'RE RAISING MONEY FOR THE   REPUBLICAN PARTY AND DOING TREMENDOUSLY ON THE SMALL DONATIONS, $61 AVERAGE OR SO. I ASKED HILLARY WHY DOESN'T SHE   MAKE $-- HOW WHY DOES -- SHE MADE $250 MILLION BY BEING IN OFFICE. WHY DON'T YOU PUT $10 MILLION OR $30 MILLION IN YOUR OWN   CAMPAIGN IN IT'S BARRY ZITO --  $30 MILLION LESS FOR SPECIAL   INTERESTS THAT WILL TELL YOU   EXACTLY WHAT TO DO AND IT WOULD   BE A NICE SIGN FOR THE AMERICAN   PUBLIC.   YOU HAVE A LOT OF IT BECAUSE OF   THE FACT THAT YOU'VE BEEN IN   OFFICE. YOU MADE A LOT OF IT WHILE YOU   WERE SECRETARY OF STATE   ACTUALLY. SO WHY AREN'T YOU PUTTING MONEY   INTO YOUR OWN CAMPAIGN?   JUST CURIOUS?  SUCH A GREAT QUESTION.   ENERGY IS UNDER SIEGE BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. ABSOLUTE SIEGE THE E.P.   PARVINGS IS KILLING THESE -- E.P.A. IS KILLING THESE ENERGY   COMPANIES AND FOREIGN COMPANIES   ARE NOW COMING IN, BUYING SO   MANY OF OUR DIFFERENT PLANTS   AND THEN REJIGGERING THE PLANTS   SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF THEIR OIL.  WE ARE KILLING, ABSOLUTELY   KILLING OUR ENERGY BUSINESS IN   THIS COUNTRY.   NOW, I'M ALL FOR ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF ENERGY, INCLUDING WIND, SOLAR, ETC., BUT WE NEED   MUCH MORE THAN WIND AND SOLAR   AND YOU LOOK AT OUR MINERS. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO PUT ALL THE MINERS OUT OF BUSINESS. THERE SAY THING CALLED CLEAN COAL.COAL LASTS 4000 YEARS IN THIS  COUNTRY. WE HAVE SO MANY THINGS -- BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY, WE HAVE  UNBELIEVABLE -- OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS, WE HAVE FOUND TREMENDOUS WEALTH RIGHT UNDER OUR FEET.  SO MUCH WEALTH. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE $20  MILLION IN DEBT -- $20 BILLION  IN DEBT.  I WILL BRING OUR COMPANIES BACK. THEY WILL MAKE MONEY.  THEY WILL PAY OFF OUR TREMENDOUS BUDGET DEFICITS WHICH ARE  TREMENDOUS.  BUT WE ARE PUTTING OUR ENERGY  COMPANIES OUT OF BUSINESS. WE HAVE TO BRING BACK OUR WORKERS.  YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS  HAPPENING TO STEAL AND -- HAPPENING TO STEEL AND CHINA DUMPING STEEL, WHICH IS KILLING OUR WORKERS. WE HAVE TO GUARD OUR ENERGY COMPANIES.  WE HAVE TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE.  THE EPA IS SO RESTRICT IT, THEY ARE PUTTING OUR ENERGY COMPANIES  OUT OF BUSINESS. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO TO A  GREAT PLACE LIKE WEST VIRGINIA OR OHIO, WHICH IS PHENOMENAL, OR  PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA, AND  YOU SEE WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO  THE PEOPLE -- MINERS AND OTHERS, IN THE ENERGY BUSINESS AND IT'S  A DISGRACE.  IT'S AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE.  --   MR. TRUMP: I CONSIDER HER STATEMENT ABOUT MY CHILDREN A  VERY NICE GOVERNMENT.  I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS MEANT TO  BE A COMPETENT. I'M VERY PROUD OF MY CHILDREN. THEY HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL KIDS.  I CONSIDER THAT A COMPLIMENT. I WILL SAY THIS ABOUT HILLARY. SHE DOESN'T QUIT. SHE DOESN'T GIVE UP.  I RESPECT THAT.  I TELL IT LIKE IT IS. SHE IS A FIGHTER. I DISAGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT SHE  IS FIGHTING FOR. I DO DISAGREE WITH HER JUDGMENT IN MANY CASES, BUT SHE DOES  FIGHT HARD AND SHE DOESN'T QUIT  AND SHE DOESN'T GIVE UP AND I  CONSIDER THAT TO BE A VERY GOOD  TRAIT.",Presidential Candidates Debate

I THINK ALL MY EMPLOYEES ARE VOTING.  I WILL TELL YOU. VIRGINIA, TRUMP, 15, CLINTON,  45.  UPI, THAT IS A BIG ONE.  THAT IS A BIG ONE. A BIG SURPRISE. LOOK AT THE MEDIA. THEY'RE GOING CRAZY.   THE MEDIA IS GOING CRAZY.  THEY DO NOT KNOW, THEY CANNOT  BELIEVE THIS.  THEY ARE NOT HAPPY, THIS IS NOT  THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE  HAPPENING.   THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,  RIGHT, THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY HAD  IN MIND.  THE CROOKED, CROOKED MEDIA WITH  THE CROOKED, CROOKED HILLARY.  NEW HAMPSHIRE, 48, 48.  WHAT IS WRONG? WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?  NEW HAMPSHIRE, 48, 48.  I DO NOT LIKE THAT.  THAT DOES NOT SOUND LIKE MY FRIENDS. WE ARE GOING TO WIN NEW  HAMPSHIRE. WE WILL WIN NEW HAMPSHIRE.   THESE ALL JUST CAME  OUT A LITTLE WHILE AGO. ARIZONA, 52, CLINTON, 42. WOW, HOW ABOUT THAT? HERE IS A GOOD ONE.  NORTH CAROLINA, UPI, TRUMP 50,  CLINTON, 46. WOAH, LOOK AT THIS ONE.  THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, WHERE  I WENT TO SCHOOL, WENT TO COLLEGE, PENNSYLVANIA, TRUMP 50,  CLINTON 46.   AND HERE IS ANOTHER  GOOD ONE, GREAT STAY, THE PEOPLE  OF GEORGIA.  TRUMP, 52, CLINTON, 43. WOW. YOU SEND IT BACK TO THE PRESS, SO THEY CAN EXAMINE IT.  SO, I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT IS REALLY AMAZING. AND I WANT TO THANK CHRIS FOR  BEING HERE, AND ALL OF MY FRIENDS. STEVE, ALL OF THE FRIENDS I  HAVE, IT IS BEEN INCREDIBLE. YOU KNOW, I WANTED TO BE HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE LOTS OF ENERGY AND WE LOVE THE PEOPLE.  AND WE LOVE THE PEOPLE, IN  PARTICULAR BECAUSE IT WAS MY  FIRST DAY, IT MEANT SO MUCH FOR ME.  AND I USED TO COME UP, THANK  YOU. I FEEL THE SAME WAY. I USED TO COME UP AND WE WOULD  HAVE MEETINGS WITH PEOPLE AND  THEY KEPT TALKING ABOUT HEROIN,  HEROIN, HEROIN.  I TELL THE STORY ALL OVER NEW  HAMPSHIRE BURIED BECAUSE IT IS SO DIFFERENT FROM THESE  BEAUTIFUL VALLEYS AND BEAUTIFUL  LAKES AND ROADS, YOU TALK ABOUT HEROIN AND IT DOES NOT WORK.  BUT IT IS A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM  HERE AND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.  AND WE WILL CLOSE UP THE BORDER,  WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL. YOU KNOW, WE GOT THE ICE  ENDORSEMENT YESTERDAY, GREAT  PEOPLE.   AND WE GOT THE BORDER  PATROL ENDORSEMENT, 16,500. AND SHERIFF JOE'S ENDORSEMENT.   SHERIFF JOE IS TOUGH  AND GOOD. BUT GETTING ICE WAS TREMENDOUS FORCE. I JUST WANT TO MAKE A QUICK REMARK. WE WILL START WITH HOWIE. AND WE WILL START.  I KNOW IT IS HOT IN HERE AND WE WANT TO KEEP THIS SMALL. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH  SUNDAY, WE ARE JUST HERE BECAUSE  WE WANTED TO BE HERE.  HILLARY, FRANKLY, TALKS ABOUT  DEBATE PREP. IT IS NOT DEBATE PREP, SHE IS RESTING.  SHE IS RESTING. AND I WANT TO BE WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND THE PEOPLE  OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND SHE WANTS  TO REST.   TONIGHT, WE WILL  DISCUSS MANY ISSUES OF GREAT  IMPORTANCE TO NEW HAMPSHIRE.  AND FEW STATES IN AMERICA HAVE  BEEN HURT WORSE BY THE TRADE  POLICIES OF MY OPPONENT, AND YOU  KNOW THAT.  NAFTA HAS BEEN A DISASTER,  SIGNED BY HER HUSBAND. AND YOU HAVE LOST NEARLY ONE IN  THREE JOBS, LOST SINCE WE MADE  DEALS WITH CHINA, WTO, WHAT A  DISASTER THAT WAS.  SUPPORTED BY HILLARY CLINTON.  THE NAFTA DEAL SIGNED BY HER  HUSBAND, ALTHOUGH HE DID A GREAT THING TWO DAYS AGO, WHEN HE WAS  WILLING TO SAY HOW BAD OBAMACARE WAS, THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD. THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.   THE OPEN BORDER  POLICIES, AND I JUST WROTE THIS OUT BUT I FEEL IT IS SO IMPORTANT, THE OPEN BORDER  POLICIES OF HILLARY CLINTON,  INCLUDING CATCH AND RELEASE, ANOTHER TERRIBLE PRACTICE, HAVE  ALLOWED A MASSIVE INFLUX OF  DRUGS INTO NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND  FRANKLY, INTO STATES ALL OVER  OUR COUNTRY.  ALMOST EVERY STATE.  AND IT HAS REALLY FUELED THE TREMENDOUS HEROIN AND DRUG CRISIS THAT WE HAVE.  WE WILL CLOSE UP THOSE BORDERS. FOLKS WILL BELIEVE ME.  AND I PROMISE THAT TO YOU IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, AND THEY TALK ABOUT IT EVERYWHERE I GO. I MENTIONED THIS STATE. BECAUSE REALLY THIS WAS REALLY  THE FIRST GLIMPSE I GOT OF HOW  SERIOUS THE PROBLEM WE HAVE,  THEY ARE POISONING OUR YOUTH,  MORE THAN OUR YOUTH, POISONING  EVERYBODY. BUT THEY ARE POISONING OUR  YOUTH.  IT IS TOUGH ENOUGH OUT THERE.  OUR YOUTH THAT DOES NOT HAVE A  CHANCE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING.  WE WILL NOT LET IT HAPPEN ANYMORE AND WE WILL HELP THE  PEOPLE THAT ARE SO BADLY AFFECTED.  WE'RE GOING TO HELP THEM.   I WILL BRING YOUR  JOBS THAT. JOBS ARE LEAVING LIKE YOU HAVE  NEVER SEEN BEFORE, RECORD LEVELS.  I WILL STOP THE DRUGS FROM  COMING IN.  I'M GOING TO CREATE SCHOOL  CHOICE AND WE WILL GET RID OF  COMMON CORE, WHICH IS A  DISASTER.   AND WE WILL CREATE  SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL FOR EVERY  DISADVANTAGED CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY.  OF WHICH, WE HAVE FAR TOO MANY.  WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL AND  REPLACE OBAMACARE.   WHICH BILL ADMITTED  THIS WEEK IS A CRAZY SYSTEM.  CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?  HEY, AT LEAST HE IS HONEST. BOY, HE HAS SUFFERED.  CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT?  HAS HE SUFFERED.  BUT HE SAID, IT IS A CRAZY SYSTEM.  HE SAYS IT IS A CRAZY SYSTEM  THAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE AND  DOES NOT WORK, AND WERE PEOPLE  END UP WITH PREMIUMS DOUBLED AND  COVERAGE CUT IN HALF.  I COULD NOT HAVE SAID IT BETTER  MYSELF. I HAVE BEEN SAYING IT FOR TWO  YEARS, LONGER.  I'M GOING TO PUT HIM ON THE CAMPAIGN.  DO YOU THINK ANYONE HAS CALLED HIM?  HE DID A MINOR RETRACTION, BUT  YOU CAN SEE HE WAS UNHAPPY ABOUT IT.  REMEMBER THE NAME, JONATHAN GRUBER? I DO NOT EVER FORGET. THE ARCHITECT, ADMITTED HE WAS  SOLD ON LIES.  HE THOUGHT HE WAS TALKING TO HIS FRIENDS, TURNED OUT NOT TO BE A  GOOD FRIEND. HIS FRIEND HAD A LITTLE CELL  PHONE, CELL PHONES ARE BRUTAL.  JUST LIKE E-MAILS ARE BRUTAL , UNLESS YOU WANT TO DELETE THEM  ALL.    UNLESS YOU DELETE ABOUT 33,000. BUT JONATHAN GRUBER, THE ARCHITECT OF OBAMACARE, ADMITTED  IT WAS SOLD ON LIES, AND TALKED  ABOUT THE STUPIDITY OF THE  AMERICAN VOTER. RIGHT? REMEMBER THAT, THE STUPIDITY OF  THE AMERICAN VOTER?  THE ONLY STUPIDITY WAS THAT THE  POLITICIANS WHO IGNORE THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE AND ABSOLUTELY  FORCED THIS THING DOWN THEIR  THROATS, HILLARY CLINTON WANTS  TO DOUBLE DOWN AND MAKE IT EVEN WORSE.  I MEAN, THAT IS ULTIMATELY WHAT  IS GOING TO HAPPEN. IN ME, YOU HAVE SEEN WHAT WE'RE  GOING TO DO.  WE WILL HAVE MUCH, MUCH BETTER  HEALTH CARE AT A MUCH LOWER PRICE. AND PEOPLE WILL BE VERY HAPPY.  EXTREMELY HAPPY. AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF  THOSE WERE DISADVANTAGED AND  CANNOT AFFORD TO DO WHAT OTHERS  CAN AFFORD TO DO.  WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM BETTER  THAN THEY ARE BEING TAKEN CARE  OF NOW.  BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE HEALTH  CARE THAT WORKS, HEALTH CARE WEAR COMPANIES COMPETE TO GET YOUR BUSINESS, THEY WILL COME UP  WITH PLANS YOU HAVE NOT EVEN  SEEN OR THOUGHT ABOUT RIGHT NOW,  IT WILL BE A BEAUTIFUL THING TO  SEE.  AND I'M SURE WE WILL BE TALKING  ABOUT IT SUNDAY NIGHT ON THE DEBATE. BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY WE ARE LOSE THIS ISSUE. IT IS A DISASTER. OBAMACARE IS A DISASTER.   WE WILL CREATE A MORE  HONEST GOVERNMENT, OUR  GOVERNMENT IS A DISASTER.  HOW ABOUT THE $1.7 MILLION IN  CASH. CASH, REMEMBER IT WAS GOING TO BE $400 MILLION, IT TURNED OUT  TO BE $1.7 BILLION IN CASH.  YOU KNOW THAT IS? THAT IS MORE THAN THIS ROOM/ . HE WOULD PUT IT IN 100TH. ALTHOUGH IT WAS FROM ALL  DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES. THEY SAID, ANYBODY SO STUPID TO  MAKE A DEAL LIKE THIS, WE DO NOT  WANT THEIR MONEY.   CAN YOU IMAGINE THIS, THESE PEOPLE? THEY NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT. AND BY THE WAY, THAT IS NOT GOING TO FIGHT TERROR.  THEY HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY THEY  WILL USE, GOING TO THEIR SWISS  BANK ACCOUNTS.  JUST ENCASE YOU HAVE ANY  QUESTIONS. ANYWAY, WE GAVE IT TO THEM, AND  BOY, DID WE GIVE IT TO THEM. I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW WE ARE  GOING TO BE A COUNTRY THAT WILL  BE RUN PROPERLY, AND BY THE TIME  THIS FINISHES, WE WILL HAVE  TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT  I FUND MYSELF. WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF WONDERFUL PEOPLE, IN TERMS OF SMALL DONATIONS.  THAT IS COMING IN FANTASTICALLY.  AND WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE WHO FEEL  VERY GOOD ABOUT OUR COUNTRY  UNDER PROPER LEADERSHIP.  BUT WE ARE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY AND WE ARE DOING IT  OURSELVES. WE ARE VERY PROUD OF IT. WE WILL BE VERY PROUD OF OUR  COUNTRY.  WHEN PEOPLE CALL OF TO ASK FOR  CERTAIN FAVORS THAT ARE BAD FOR  THE COUNTRY BUT GOOD FOR THEM,  THE BEST PART, I DO NOT HAVE TO  TAKE THEIR PHONE CALL.  I DO NOT NEED THEM.  I DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE THEIR  PHONE CALL.   BEFORE WE GO ANY  FURTHER, I WANT TO SEND OUR THOUGHTS, OUR HEARTS ARE WITH  ALL THE PEOPLE AND PRAYERS, TO , THE MILLIONS IN THE PAST OF  WHAT IS KNOWN AS HURRICANE  MATTHEW.  IT IS A BIG ONE AND A BAD ONE.  HOPEFULLY IT TAKES A RIGHT TURN,  BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS GOING  IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, NOT GOOD. IT IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST  STORMS TO HIT IN MANY DECADES,  AND OUR NEIGHBORS IN FLORIDA AND  GEORGIA AND THE CAROLINAS ARE IN  THE DIRECT PATH, IT SEEMS. SOUTHEAST FLORIDA IS TAKING THE BRUNT. WE HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS IN  FLORIDA, A LOT OF BUILDINGS, AND  A LOT OF INVESTMENTS, A LOT OF  GREAT EMPLOYEES. SOUTHEAST FLORIDA IS TAKING THE  BRUNT OF THE STORM. TO ALL OF MY FRIENDS IN FLORIDA,  PLEASE KNOW WE ARE PRAYING FOR YOU.  AND EVERYONE IN THE PATH YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND GET OUT OF THE AREA.  YOU HAVE TO LISTEN.  YOU HAVE A GREAT GOVERNOR,  GOVERNOR SCOTT.  AND YOU HAVE TO LISTEN. BECAUSE IT COULD BE A REALLY,  REALLY BAD ONE. SO, IT COULD BE A ROUGH COUPLE  DAYS, MAYBE BEYOND THAT, WE WILL  SEE WHAT THE PATH IS. WE HAVE SEEN IT, THE DAMAGE IN THE CARIBBEAN, THE BAHAMAS, HAITI. THEY SAY IN HAITI, THEY THINK AROUND 270 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN  KILLED BY THIS TERRIBLE STORM.  SO, TO FOLKS IN HAITI AND ALL  OVER, WE WILL BE HELPING YOU AND  WE WILL BE WITH YOU. AND WE SEND OUR BEST WISHES AND PRAYERS.  WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM  THAT I THINK IS BREWING RIGHT  NOW, AS WE SPEAK.  WE WILL KNOW IN ABOUT FOUR OR  FIVE HOURS.  I JUST SPOKE TO RICK SCOTT, AND  GOVERNOR CHRISTIE SPOKE TO RICK SCOTT. AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS JUST  FOUR OR FIVE HOURS AWAY.  BUT WHATEVER HAPPENS, WE ARE  WITH EVERYBODY. BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS  GOING TO BE A BAD ONE, MAYBE THE  WORST IN A LONG TIME.  WITH THAT, HOWIE CARR HAS BEEN AMAZING.  I DON'T KNOW IF HE IS ALLOWED TO SUPPORT, BUT I THINK HE SUPPORTS ME. I DO NOT KNOW IF HE SUPPORTS ME -- I AM NOT SURE HE HAS ALLOWED  TO, BUT I THINK HE PROBABLY  DOES.   HE HAS BEEN AMAZING,  AND HE IS A VERY TALENTED GUY,  HE IS A TERRIFIC GUY WITH A  TERRIFIC FAMILY. THEY SAID, LET'S GET HOW WE -- HOWIE. YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS.  TELL YOU WHAT, IF I AND DOING WELL, DO NOT CALL ME. IF I AM ANSWERING THE QUESTION POORLY, PLEASE CALL ME  IMMEDIATELY. . YOU CAN GO AND 30 SECOND.  HI, MATTHEW.  I DID HOLD BACK, I  THOUGHT IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE TO  SAY WHAT I WAS REALLY THINKING. AND I THINK I HELD BACK FOR GOOD  REASON. I THINK FOR GOOD REASON.  I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE IT BE  ON POLICY, AND I DID NOT LIKE  GETTING INTO THE GUTTER.  AND SO I DID HOLD BACK. ALSO, HONESTLY, THIS WAS THE  SO-CALLED COMMISSION ON  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES.  GIVE ME A BREAK.  DID YOU SEE WHERE THEY CAME  FROM? ONE OF THEM COMES FROM THE  HILLARY CAMP, HAD PERSON.  MY MICROPHONE WORKS PERFECTLY.  IT IS INGESTING, I WENT THERE  BEFORE AND SAID, BOY, THE MIKE C IS SO GREAT. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY TURNED IT UP  AND DOWN.  EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM SAW IT.  WE HAD A REAL PROBLEM.  THE HEAD OF THE DEBATE SAID, IT  WAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM.  HE TOLD US TO MAYOR GIULIANI. IT WAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AFTER  THE DEBATE.  AN HOUR AND A HALF. HE SAID NOW THAT THE DEBATE IS  OVER I AM GOING BACKSTAGE TO  FIND OUT WHAT IS  I SAID, OH GREAT,  THAT HELPS. BUT I REALLY FELT LIKE ONE AND  TO KEEP IT ON AS HIGH A LEVEL AS POSSIBLE.  LET US SEE WHAT HAPPENS. LET US SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I THINK WE ARE ALL BETTER OFF IF  WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE IT IS  ABOUT ISSUES AND POLICIES.   GOOD.  DO WE HAVE 24 HOURS  TO TALK ABOUT IT?  LOOK, WE HAVE HAD FAILURES AT  EVERY LEVEL, I THINK THE IRAN  DEAL IS ONE OF THE WORST DEALS I  HAVE EVER SEEN, IT WILL LEAD TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS. I WAS WITH BIBI NETANYAHU THE OTHER DAY AND TALKED ABOUT IT. NOT TO REVEAL WHAT HE SAID, BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT I SAID. THIS IS HORRIBLE FOR ISRAEL AND HORRIBLE FOR OUR COUNTRY. IT IS A HORRIBLE DEAL BECAUSE OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, WITHIN 10 YEARS, GOING TO BE ENDING UP WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  THEY HAVE LIKE A OAPATH. ON TOP OF IT, WE GAVE THEM BACK $150 BILLION.  WE PAID RANSOM FOR OUR HOSTAGES,  OBVIOUSLY, AND OBAMA SAID IT HAD  NOTHING TO DO -- WHY DID THEY  DELAY IT?  UNTIL AUGUST MONEY CAME IN? MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT IS A BAD DEAL.  I AM ALL FOR DEAL. I HAPPEN TO THINK THAT NUCLEAR  IS ABOUT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE  HAVE IN THE WORLD TODAY.  OBAMA THINKS IT IS GLOBAL  WARMING. I THINK IT IS NUCLEAR, IN THE  HANDS OF THE WRONG PLAYERS.  THIS IS DEVASTATING, THERE IS NO  WINNER.  THERE WILL NEVER BE A WINNER  WITH NUCLEAR, BELIEVE ME.  AND SO I THINK DEALS ARE FINE, BUT THEY HAVE TO BE GOOD DEALS. THE DEAL MADE BY SECRETARY KERRY NEVER LEFT THE TABLE, HE JUST AGREED, AGREED.  YOU WOULD WANT SOMETHING, THEY WOULD SAY NO, HE WOULD LEAVE THE  TABLE. SO SAD, BUT THERE IS ONE EXAMPLE  OF A HORRIBLE THING, WE SHOULD  NEVER HAVE GONE INTO IRAQ.  SHOULD NEVER HAVE GONE INTO IRAQ.  BUT OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE, BUT ALMOST EQUAL IMPORTANCE, HOW WE GOT OUT.  OBAMA CREATED THIS INCREDIBLE  VACUUM, ISIS WAS FORMED, A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROBLEMS HAPPENED. AND TOTALLY DESTABILIZED. YOU KNOW THE SURGE, WHETHER YOU , ARE IN FAVOR OF GOING IN OR  NOT, THE SURGE WORKED. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, BOOM. THEN WE ANNOUNCED WE ARE LEAVING HERE. HOW ABOUT MOSUL? THEY KEEP SAYING WE WILL ATTACK MOSUL, WHY DID THEY SAY THAT? A LETTER THE BAD GUYS, THE  LEADERS OF ISIS ARE THERE.  ISN'T THERE AN ELEMENT OF SURPRISE?  REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE YOUNG  AND WE WERE STUDYING HISTORY AND  THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT THE GREAT GENERALS AND THE GREAT ATTACKS.  IT WAS CALLED THE ELEMENT OF  SURPRISE? ONE THAT BE NICE IF WE ATTACKED FIRST, AND TALKED ABOUT THE  GREAT VICTORY LATER? NO, SERIOUSLY.   THEY'RE WASTING THEIR  TIME ATTACKING MOSUL. BECAUSE EVERYONE WE WANT WILL BE GONE.  IT WILL BE ALSO BILLIONS AND  TREMENDOUS DEATH AND CARNAGE.  THE PEOPLE WE WANT, HEY, THEY  WILL TELL THE LEADERS, GET THE  HELL OUT OF HERE.  IT IS A VERY SAD THING. WE ARE RUN BY PEOPLE WHO ARE  INCOMPETENT. I WILL TELL YOU THAT.   HOW ARE YOU?  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  I APPRECIATE IT.  THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN WHO OWNS A  RADIO STATION, ALL HISPANICS,  AND HE WAS ARGUING WITH ONE OF  THE HOSTS. HE SAID YOU DON'T  UNDERSTAND, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE  CALLING IN, HISPANICS, THEY'RE  ALL FOR DONALD TRUMP.  I SAID I WAS EVEN SURPRISED, BUT I AM FOR DONALD TRUMP ALSO.  THIS IS HAPPENING MORE AND MORE.  I JUST GOT BACK. I JUST GOT BACK FROM LAS VEGAS. WE HAD A TREMENDOUS CROWD OF PEOPLE.  A LOT OF HISPANICS.  AND LATINOS, THEY LIKE TO BE  CALLED IN THAT AREA, YOU KNOW  THAT, RIGHT? HISPANICS AND LATINOS.  WE HAD TREMENDOUS RESPONSE, JUST  TREMENDOUS OUTPOURING OF LOVE.  IT WAS AMAZING.  AND, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE THAT ARE  HERE ILLEGALLY, THEY DON'T WANT  PEOPLE COMING ACROSS THE BORDER  ILLEGALLY, TAKING THEIR JOBS, HOMES, WHATEVER THEY WANT TO  TAKE. AND WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME IN.  I WANT YOU WOULD COME IN SO BAD, BUT HAVE TO COME AND LEGALLY. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A COUNTRY, AND  WE HAVE LAWS.  WE HAVE A BORDER. AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BORDER, YOU DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY. BUT I THINK THE BIGGEST SURPRISE, TWO SURPRISES, WE ARE  GOING TO DO GREAT WITH  AFRICAN-AMERICANS. YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING  WITH THE INNER CITIES, IT IS A DISGRACE.  AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN  RUNNING THEM FOR UP TO 100 YEARS. UNBROKEN.  AND THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS, BELIEVE ME, I THINK WE ARE DOING -- YOU SEE HOW THE NUMBERS ARE  CHANGING.  ONE THING THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT  OF CONFIDENCE IN HILLARY CLINTON.  SHE HAS LIED TO THEM FOR YEARS. SHE DOES NOT PRODUCE, SHE JUST  DOES NOT PRODUCE.  BUT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO  GREAT WITH THE  AFRICAN-AMERICANS. YOU LOOK AT THE POVERTY IN THE  INNER CITIES, THE CRIME, THE  EDUCATION, AND THERE ARE NO  JOBS. AND WE ARE GOING TO DO FANTASTIC  WITH HISPANICS.  I BELIEVE THAT.  WE ARE KEEPING IT.  HI, KAREN.  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU.  I LIKE THIS AUDIENCE.   THE MIDDLE CLASS HAS  BEEN LEFT BEHIND. TAXES ARE TOO HIGH, JOBS HAVE  BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU.  A LOT OF OUR COMPANIES, A LOT OF  GREAT COMPANIES HAVE LEFT OUR  COUNTRY. THEY HAVE GONE TO MEXICO AND  OTHER PLACES.  CHINA IS MAKING SO MUCH OF OUR  PRODUCT, WE DON'T MAKE ANY  PRODUCT ANYMORE, LIKE WE USED TO.  AND I WILL TELL YOU, SUCH A  GREAT QUESTION, BECAUSE THE  MIDDLE CLASS HAS BEEN TREATED SO  BADLY BY THE POLITICIANS. I MEAN, IT IS LIKE FOR GOTTEN MARRIED AND WE ARE LOWERING  TAXES, AS YOU KNOW, WAY DOWN FOR  THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE ARE CHANGING THE TAX STRUCTURE COMPLETELY. WE HAD SEVEN BRACKETS, NOW WE HAVE THREE. AND WE ARE BRINGING IT DOWN ACTUALLY FOR THOSE MAKING NOT A LOT.  IT IS ZERO. AND WE DON'T WANT THEM BECAUSE IT IS HUGE BUREAUCRATICALLY AND EXTREMELY COSTLY, BUT WE ARE BRINGING THE RATES DOWN TO  NUMBERS THAT ARE MUCH LOWER. YOU HAVE SEEN THE NUMBERS. MUCH LOWER.  AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A MUCH  LOWER TAX RATE. HILLARY CLINTON IS RAISING YOUR  TAXES WAY UP.  I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT SHE'S THINKING.  WE ARE ALREADY THE HIGHEST TAXED  NATION IN THE WORLD.  JUST ABOUT. THE COMMITTEE FIND, EVERY ONCE A  WHILE, THEY WILL FACT CHECK ME.  NOW, THERE IS A NATION YOU HAVE  NEVER HEARD OF.  WHERE IT IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER. WE ARE JUST ABOUT, OF THE INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS, WE ARE  THE HIGHEST TAXPAYERS IN THE  WORLD.  WE ARE THE HIGHEST TAXED NATION  IN THE WORLD.  OUR BUSINESS TAXES WILL BE BROUGHT FROM 35%, 15%, WE'RE  CUTTING REGULATIONS.  WE WANT REGULATIONS, FOR  ENVIRONMENTAL. WE WANT REGULATIONS, FOR SAFETY.  BUT THE REGULATIONS ARE MASSIVE, HOWIE. THEY ARE MASSIVE.  AND WE'RE CUTTING THE  REGULATIONS AT A TREMENDOUS  SLOPE, AND I WOULD SAY 70% OF  THE REGULATIONS CAN GO.  IT IS JUST STOPPING BUSINESSES  FROM GROWING.  AND I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO SEE  A TREMENDOUS CHANGE IN THIS  COUNTRY.  WE ARE GOING TO SEE JOBS COME BACK.  WE ARE GOING TO SEE COMPANIES COME BACK INTO THE COUNTRY. RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE LEAVING. IT IS A ONE-WAY STREET. WE HAVE A ONE-WAY STREET RIGHT  OUT OF THE COUNTRY.  AND THEY ARE GOING LARGELY TO  MEXICO AND OTHER PLACES, BUT  MEXICO IS THE EIGHTH WONDER OF  THE WORLD. I TELL THE STORY A LOT.  I HAVE A FRIEND WHO BUILDS THESE  MASSIVE PLANTS.  HE SAYS, DONALD, YOU HAVE TO SEE  WHAT IS GOING ON IN MEXICO.  I SAID HOW ABOUT OUR COUNTRY?  HE SAID NOT SO MUCH.  WE WILL SWITCH THAT AROUND HERE . AND WE WILL GET ALONG THE MEXICO  BY THE WAY.  WE HAVE TO SWITCH THAT AROUND. IT IS A ONE-WAY HIGHWAY OUT OF THE U.S.  THAT IS THE BIGGEST  PROBLEM, THAT TAKES PLACE WITH  SO MANY.  AND EVEN THOUGH IT IS 100  DEGREES IN THE ROOM, IT WAS NOT  MEANT FOR THAT MANY PEOPLE, YOU  DO KNOW THAT. RIGHT? I HEARD THE OTHER NIGHT, I WAS  MAKING A SPEECH AND WE HAD  TREMENDOUS, MASSIVE CROWDS AND  IT WAS REALLY HOT.  SO, A LITTLE WARM, THERE  MIGHT'VE BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF SWEAT. AND ONE OF THESE DISHONEST PEOPLE SAID DONALD TRUMP WAS SWEATING. I SAID, SWEATING?  IT WAS 100 DEGREES.   AND GUESS WHAT, WE ARE ALL  SWEATING TONIGHT?  THAT IS OK.  THAT IS GOOD. THAT IS HEALTHY.  THE BIGGEST PROBLEM YOU HAVE IS THAT PEOPLE GO TO COLLEGE.  THAT IS GREAT. GETTING OUT MAGNA, THAT IS  REALLY SMART. IT IS FANTASTIC.  BUT PEOPLE GO TO COLLEGE, THEY  BORROW MONEY, UP TO HERE, UP TO  THEIR NECK IN DEBT.  THEY GET OUT AND CAN'T GET A JOB.  IT IS SUCH A MASSIVE PROBLEM. THEY CAN'T GET A JOB. THE REALLY GOOD JOBS ARE GONE,  AND THEY HAVE GONE TO OTHER COUNTRIES.  AND SO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES ARE  MAKING OUR PRODUCT.  I WANT TO SEE THE DAY WHEN YOU  CAN GET THOSE GREAT MARKS, THAT  INCREDIBLE PROFESSION, WHICH YOU  LOVE PROBABLY, OR YOU WOULD NOT  HAVE BEEN SO HIGH UP IN THE  CLASS, RIGHT, AT THE TOP?  BUT I WANT TO SEE THE DAY WE  HAVE THOSE JOBS BACK IN THIS COUNTRY AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.  I WANT TO SEE THE DAY WHEN APPLE  WILL MAKE THE IPHONE IN THIS  COUNTRY, INSTEAD OF MAKING THEM  IN CHINA, VIETNAM, ALL OVER THE  PLACE.   OK?  AND BELIEVE ME, IF I'M PRESIDENT, THAT IS GOING TO  HAPPEN. I USE APPLE, BUT APPLE IS NOT  MAKING THEM HERE, MOSTLY CHINA,  NOW VIETNAM, WHICH IS BECOMING  VERY STRONG FOR THIS.  THEY ARE GOING TO START MAKING THEM HERE. WE HAVE THE PEOPLE.  WE HAVE THE MOST UNBELIEVABLE PEOPLE.  IF I HAVE LEARNED ONE THING IN  GOING AROUND, WE STARTED ON JUNE  16 OF LAST YEAR, AND I HAVE GOT TEN TO KNOW THE PEOPLE. AND WE HAVE BY FAR THE BIGGEST RALLIES THAT PEOPLE HAVE SEEN, FAR BIGGER THAN BERNIE, HE WAS  SECOND, FAR BIGGER.  NOW, BERNIE'S NOT SO BIG.  BY THE WAY, THEY ARE VERY SMALL. BERNIE MADE A BIG MISTAKE. BY THE WAY, BERNIE SANDERS WOULD HAVE BEEN LEGENDARY, IF HE DID NOT MAKE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL. WHEN HE MADE THAT DEAL, HIS STOCK WENT WAY DOWN, WAY DOWN. I MEAN, HONESTLY, EVEN AS SOMEBODY THAT HAS DISAGREED WITH  HIM ON A LOT OF THINGS, OTHER THAN TRADE, WE AGREE VERY MUCH ON TRADE, VERY, VERY MUCH. ON TRADE, EXCEPT I WILL DO  THINGS ABOUT TRADE, BECAUSE I  LIKE FREE TRADE, BUT I WANT TO MAKE GREAT DEAL FAIR TRADE. HE WAS RIGHT, BECAUSE OUR  COUNTRY IS BEING RIPPED OFF ON  JOBS AND EVERYTHING.  BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A  COUNTRY THAT MAKES PRODUCT AGAIN.  WE ARE TO HAVE A COUNTRY THAT  APPLE AND THESE OTHER GREAT  COMPANIES ARE GOING TO MAKE  THEIR PRODUCT IN OUR COUNTRY,  AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE LOTS OF  PEOPLE WORKING, INCLUDING YOURSELF.  WE HAVE TO DO THAT.  OK?  THANK YOU.   HI, BOB.  WELL, I GUESS WE WILL  BE TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A  WHILE TO COME, BUT I HAVE TO  TELL YOU, IT IS ONE OF THE  SADDEST THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN  HAPPEN TO OUR COUNTRY.  WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH HILLARY  CLINTON, WHERE YOU SEND E-MAILS , WHERE THEY SEND A SUBPOENA,  AND THEY WANT ALL OF YOUR  E-MAILS, I MEAN, IF YOU'RE IN  PRIVATE BUSINESS AND YOU DO WHAT  SHE DID, IT IS CALLED -- OK, THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, CONGRESS, SENT A SUBPOENA, WANTING E-MAILS. AND SHE GETS THE SUBPOENA AND  SHE DELETES 33,000 E-MAILS. AND MANY OTHER THINGS, INCLUDING  LYING ALL OVER THE PLACE.  AND YOU SEE PEOPLE WHO HAVE  SUFFERED GREATLY, INCLUDING GENERAL PETRAEUS, FOR DOING A  TINY FRACTION OF WHAT SHE DID.  WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT ONLINE. -- ALL NIGHT.  BUT THE LIES SHE TOLD THE CONGRESS, AND THE LIES SHE TOLD  TO THE PEOPLE. YOU SEE THE FBI GIVE HER A NO  ANYTHING, NO SWEARING IN.  YOU DON'T HAVE TO EVEN SWEAR IN?  THEY QUESTIONED HER ON THE  FOURTH OF JULY. AND THEN, THEY RELEASED THE  FINDINGS ON LABOR DAY, RIGHT  BEFORE LABOR DAY.  EVERYONE IS GONE, THEY'RE GONE  HERE AND THERE.  I THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO -- BECAUSE I HAVE RESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE FBI, AND I HAVE SUCH INCREDIBLE PEOPLE, WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE  FBI AND TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE HIGHEST  LEVEL, HONESTLY, I THINK IT IS  ONE OF THE SADDEST THINGS I'VE  EVER SEEN IN THIS COUNTRY.  WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR DO NOT  LIKE IT, TO LOOK AT WHAT IS  HAPPENED AND TO LOOK AT THE WAY  IT HAS BEEN HANDLED, AND YOU  KNOW, EVERY TIME I SPEAK THIS IS MENTIONED.  THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE  VERY, VERY ANGRY. AND I WOULD THINK THAT SOME OF  THESE GREAT FBI AGENTS AND THE  PEOPLE THAT WORK WITHIN THE FBI,  I WOULD IMAGINE THEY ARE JUST  FURIOUS AS TO WHAT HAS HAPPENED  TO THE REPUTATION OF THE FBI.  SO, I MEAN, I THINK IT IS AN  AMAZING QUESTION.  HONESTLY, IT IS LIKE WE ARE A  THIRD WORLD COUNTRY.  IT IS ONE OF THE SADDEST THINGS  I HAD EVER SEEN HAPPEN IN THIS  COUNTRY, AND IT HAPPENED TO  JUSTICE, AND THAT IS PROBABLY I  GUESS THE WAY YOU FEEL ALSO?  YEAH, IT IS VERY SAD.  I JUST AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.  YOU KNOW, WHEN HE READ THE CHARGES AND HE IS GOING 1, 2, 3, 4 -- I'M SAYING, WOW, THEY'RE  GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING.  THEN, HE GOES -- ESSENTIALLY,  HOWEVER, IT WAS AMAZING.  TO GO POINT AFTER POINT, AND  THAT WAS ONLY A FEW OF THEM.  SO, IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING. VERY DISAPPOINTING.  WE DON'T HAVE TOO  MANY.  I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU, THE  PRESS LIKES TO REPORT WE HAVE  SOME OF THESE LONG-TERM PEOPLE  THAT HAVE DONE SUCH A BAD JOB.  LOOK AT THE PROBLEM OUR COUNTRY  IS IN.  I WOULD NEVER USE THESE PEOPLE.  AND THEY KNOW THAT.  SO THEN THEY ANNOUNCE IN A GROUP THEY ARE GOING OVER TO HILLARY, RIGHT?  YOU UNDERSTAND. THEY ANNOUNCE IN A GROUP. WE HAVE TREMENDOUS SUPPORT, INCLUDING A COUPLE OF YOUR VERY DISTINGUISHED FOLKS FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHO WERE AGAINST ME,  WHO ARE NOW FOR ME.  AND YOU ARE ALLOWED TO ANNOUNCE  THE NAMES, BUT WE HAVE  TREMENDOUS SUPPORT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.  ONE OF THEM WAS VERY TOUGH AND  VERY SMART.  GO AHEAD.  THAT'S TRUE. I WATCHED HIM AS A BOY.  HE IS TOUGH.  THAT'S GOOD. I THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIFIC. I MENTIONED THE OTHER DAY. AND, I'M SORRY, I THINK THEY'RE  GREAT PEOPLE, BUT HE WAS TOUGH.  I TELL YOU WHAT, HE WAS REALLY  HUNTING FOR TRUMP.  AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I HAVE  RESPECT FOR SOMEBODY WHO CAN GO OVER -- WHO CAN GO THE OTHER  WAY, A PIVOT, AS YOU WOULD SAY. BUT I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE  FAMILY, AND THE FACT THAT THEY  ARE WITH ME.  AND I AM WITH THEM.  AND THEY ARE GOING TO DO VERY  WELL.  HE WILL DO VERY WELL.  I SEE THE NUMBERS.  YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT  HAPPENED, THEY THOUGHT OH,  TRUMP, I HAVE NEVER DONE THIS.  BUT I'VE DONE VERY WELL IN LIFE  AND BUSINESS, A LOT OF THINGS  VERY WELL, BUT I'VE NEVER DONE  THIS.  ALL OF THE POINTS THAT WE WILL  TAKE DOWN THE CENTER AND THE  SENATOR? YOU KNOW HOW WELL THEIR -- HOW WELL THE REPUBLICANS ARE  DOING? I GUESS THERE IS A GENTLEMAN IN ILLINOIS NOT DOING SO WELL.  THIS GUY WAS ACTUALLY TAKING OUT  ADS AGAINST ME. I SAID ARE YOU SURE HE IS A  REPUBLICAN?  MAYBE HE IS A DEMOCRAT. BUT THAT IS HIS PROBLEM.  HE WAS NOT FOR ME. THAT WAS FOR POLITICAL REASONS. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING  ON, NOW THEY ARE ALL TALKING ABOUT -- IN FACT, THE OTHER DAY I SAW VERY INTERESTINGLY, YOU  KNOW, DONALD TRUMP IS HAVING A  VERY POSITIVE EFFECT ON THESE RACES. THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO HOLD. THEY'RE DOING TERRIFICALLY WELL, FAR BETTER THAN ANYONE THOUGHT. AND FRANKLY, WE ARE WINNING STATES AND ARE GOING TO WIN SOME  STATES THAT WOULD NEVER IN A  MILLION YEARS -- YOU KNOW THIS, BE IN PLAY.  WE HAVE SOME STATES LIKE  COLORADO, SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD NOT DO WELL.  WE'RE DOING GREAT. I THINK WE ARE LEADING COLORADO AND -- IN ONE OF OF THE POLLS THAT CAME OUT.  I JUST LEFT, WE ARE LEADING A  LOT OF PLACES, AND DOING AT  LEAST VERY COMPETITIVELY IN A  LOT OF STATES THAT ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT BE FOR REPUBLICANS.  AND ONE OF THE FUNNY THINGS,  THEY DO THE MAPS.  REMEMBER, I WATCHED THE PEOPLE  THAT DO THE MAPS.  IT IS TOUGHER FOR THE REPUBLICANS, I HAVE TO TELL YOU,  BUT THEY SAID THERE IS A VERY  SMALL PATH.  I WAS WATCHING THE OTHER DAY, AND THE SAME PERSON WAS SAYING,  WOW, THIS PATHWAY IS GETTING A  LOT WIDER.  DOES THAT MEAN THEY WERE HAPPY ABOUT IT, BUT -- NOW THERE ARE  FOUR DIFFERENT PATHS.  NATE SILVER, YOU KNOW, HE DID  NOT PREDICT US IN THE PRIMARY.  HE NEVER CALLED A LOSER BEFORE.  HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON THE RIGHT  SIDE OF WHAT HAPPENED, IN TERMS  OF AT LEAST HIS PREDICTIONS. HE DID NOT PREDICT ME IN THE  PRIMARIES, AND IN ALL FAIRNESS,  HE HAS NEVER SEEN ME, NEVER  SPOKEN TO ME, NEVER SAW WHAT WE DID.  YOU KNOW, WE HAD 17 VERY  TALENTED PEOPLE. ONE BY ONE BY ONE, IT WAS A  BEAUTIFUL SIGHT TO WATCH.   BY THE WAY, THOSE  PEOPLE, MOST OF THEM ENDORSED  ME. BEN CARSON, CHRIS CHRISTIE, SO  MANY OF THEM ENDORSED ME.  THEY ARE GREAT.  SCOTT WALKER HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE.  MIKE PENCE HAS BEEN  INCREDIBLE. HE DID A GREAT JOB LAST NIGHT.   THANK YOU, LOIS.  JOHN HARWOOD WAS THE  WORST MODERATOR OUT OF ALL THE DEBATES WE HAD.  HOW MANY DID WE HAVE, 11 OR 12? HE WAS SO BAD. THIS GUY KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ME. I WAS SO HAPPY.  I SAW TODAY THAT SOMEONE ON CNN,  THE CLINTON NEWS NETWORK, WHO  KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT US, THEY USE  JOHN KING, ACTUALLY. I LIKE HIM ON THE MAPS, DOES A GOOD JOB.  I LIKE THEM BETTER THAN I DID A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, BECAUSE A  COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO I HAD NO CHANCE AREA NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN -- NO CHANCE. NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT MAP IS GETTING VERY RED.  BUT JOHN KING SAID, YOU KNOW,  THEY ALWAYS HAVE A SOURCE, THEY  ALWAYS HAVE A SOURCE.  NOBODY TALKS TO HIM.  NOBODY TALKS BECAUSE HE IS,  LIKE, THE ENEMY, THE ENEMY, BUT  A FEW OF THE PEOPLE SAID DONALD  TRUMP WAS FIRST HAPPY, THEN HE WAS UNHAPPY BECAUSE MIKE PENCE DID SO WELL.  I SAID UNHAPPY? WE ARE JUMPING UP AND DOWN. AND I TELL YOU WHAT, HE IS A  GREAT HUMAN BEING. YOU CANNOT ROOT AGAINST HIM.  YOU CAN'T.   I WAS TELLING CHRIS  CHRISTIE, CAN YOU IMAGINE THE  PEOPLE SAYING THAT I WOULD HAVE  LOVED TO, YOU KNOW, SEE HIM NOT  DO WELL BECAUSE THAT MAKES ME  LOOK BETTER?  THESE PEOPLE -- THAT IS WHY A  GUY LIKE JOHN KING HAS STAYED IN  THE SAME POSITION. HOW LONG HAS HE BE IN -- HAS HE  BEEN AT CNN? I USED TO SAY SOMEDAY HE WOULD  BE AN ANCHOR.  GUESS WHAT?  HE IS STILL DOING THE MAPS.  NO, I WAS SO HAPPY. I CAN GIVE YOU MY WORD ON THIS,  I WAS SO HAPPY THAT MIKE DID WELL.  I WAS ROOTING HIM ON, AND WE  WERE TALKING ALL DURING THE DAY, AND I WAS GIVING HIM SOME IDEAS, AND WE WERE RUNNING THINGS BY  EACH OTHER. IT IS SO DISCONCERTING. EVEN TONIGHT, THEY SAID DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO NEW HAMPSHIRE TO PRACTICE FOR SUNDAY. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SUNDAY. THEY MAKE YOU LIKE A CHILD. I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF NEW  HAMPSHIRE. THIS WAS SET UP A LITTLE WHILE  AGO. THEY WERE GOING TO CANCEL IT, AND I SAID WHY ARE YOU GOING TO CANCEL IT? THEY SAID, WELL, YOU WANTED  DEBATE PREP.  I SAID, FORGET DEBATE PREP.  GIVE ME A BREAK.  DO YOU THINK HILLARY CLINTON IS  IN DEBATE PREP?  SHE IS RESTING. SHE WANTS TO BUILD UP HER ENERGY  FOR SUNDAY NIGHT.  AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT IS FINE. BUT THE NARRATIVE IS SO FOOLISH. I'M HERE FOR ONE REASON.  I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE.  I SAID I WAS GOING TO BE HERE,  AND I AM HERE.  VERY SIMPLE.   THAT IS TROUBLE.  ALWAYS GO INTO WHAT  YOU LOVE DOING.  YOU MAY HAVE PARENTS PUSHING YOU ONE WAY, BUT YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT  YOU LOVE. I SAY THIS ALL THE TIME IN SPEECHES AND EVERYTHING.  I MEAN, I WILL SPEAK IN FRONT OF  YOUNG PEOPLE, BECAUSE I LOVE DOING IT. I SAY, ALWAYS FOLLOW YOUR DREAM, ALWAYS GO INTO WHAT YOU LOVE, AND NEVER, EVER QUIT OR GIVE UP.  I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE, BIG  PEOPLE AND NOT SO BIG, USUALLY NOT A BIG BECAUSE IF THEY QUIT THEY WON'T GET BIG, THE MOST  SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE I HAVE BEEN -- I HAVE MET ARE THE PEOPLE WHO  NEVER QUIT AND NEVER GIVE UP. THEY JUST DON'T TAKE NO FOR AN  ANSWER. DO SOMETHING THAT YOU REALLY LOVE DOING, BECAUSE THAT IS NOT WORK.  AND NEVER, EVER QUIT OR GIVE UP.  DO ONE OR TWO MORE?   THANK YOU.  HELLO, AL.  THE VETERANS -- I  HAVE GOTTEN CLOSE TO SOME OF YOU -- A LOT OF IT STARTED WITH NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA, BUT I REALLY GOT CLOSE TO THE VETS. IN MANY CASES, THEY ARE LIVING IN HELL.  WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE  VETERANS ADMINISTRATION BETWEEN THE CORRUPTION, THE LONG, LONG WAITS, 22 SUICIDES A DAY. WHEN I HEARD THAT, I SAID,  THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.  22 SUICIDES A DAY, MUCH BECAUSE  THEY CANNOT GET TO SEE A DOCTOR. HOWIE, THEY WAIT IN LINE FOR  FIVE OR SIX DAYS, AND AT THE END  OF THE SIXTH DAY, THE DOCTOR SAYS, SORRY, I'M GOING ON VACATION.  VETS TELL ME THIS, THEY HAVE REALLY GREAT DOCTORS, BUT GETTING TO SEE THEM IS SOMETIMES ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.  WE ARE GOING TO SOLVE, FINALLY,  THE PROBLEM OF THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION.  WE HAVE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THAT IN MANY CASES ARE TREATED BETTER  THAN OUR VETERANS. YOU KNOW THAT AND EVERYBODY  KNOWS THAT.  THEY ARE BEING TREATED BETTER  THAN OUR VETERANS.  THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.  ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE GOING TO DO IS, THE LINES ARE IMPOSSIBLE.  JUST DAYS AND DAYS TO SEE THE  DOCTOR. WHEN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE HAPPENS,  WE WILL LET OUR VETERANS GO  ACROSS THE STREET, AROUND THE  CORNER, TWO MILES AWAY, AND SEE  A DOCTOR, PRIVATE, OR A  HOSPITAL, PUBLIC OR PRIVATE,  WHERE THEY ARE LOOKING FOR WORK,  WOULD HAVE WONDERFUL PEOPLE  LOOKING FOR WORK.  TAKE CARE OF THEIR PROBLEM, AND  WE WILL PAY THE BILL.  AND THAT IS GOING TO BE THE  CHEAPEST THING WE CAN DO, THE  CHEAPEST THING WE CAN DO.   AND AL CAN TELL YOU,  A LOT OF THE VETS I RECOGNIZE  IN THE ROOM CAN TELL YOU, EVERYBODY IS IN LOVE WITH THE  PLAN. WE WILL KEEP THE PLAN, BUT KEEP  THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION, KEEP THE HOSPITALS, KEEP THE BUILDINGS, BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT. WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS.  THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WOULD NOT  BE HERE IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE VETS. BUT WHEN THEY ARE WAITING IN  LINE, AND THEY KNOW THERE IS NO  END IN SIGHT, AND HONESTLY, THEY  ARE DYING.  THEY NEED A SIMPLE PROCEDURE, THEY NEED A PRESCRIPTION, THEY  NEED SOMETHING VERY EASY, AND  THEY END UP DYING. IS A VERY SAD THING, SO THERE -- SO THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO ACROSS THE STREET TO A  PUBLIC OR PRIVATE HOSPITAL, TO A DOCTOR, AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS. FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE'RE REALLY GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS. OK?   LET ME TELL YOU, YOU  HAVE HEARD THAT, MOST PEOPLE DO  NOT BELIEVE IT, BUT IT IS TRUE.  SHE IS OPEN BORDER. SHE WANTS PEOPLE TO JUST BLOW  THROUGH. LOOK, WHEN THE BORDER PATROL  AGENTS COME OUT -- AND I HAVE  NEVER ENDORSED ENDORSED A  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BEFORE, -- AND THEY HAVE NEVER ENDORSED  A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BEFORE,  BUT THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE.  THEY WANT TO DO THEIR JOB.  IT IS MUCH HARDER TO DO THE JOB,  BUT TO STAND BACK AND LET THE MEN.  CATCH AND RELEASE IS A DISASTER.  BUT WHEN THEY WANT TO DO THEIR  JOBS, AND IT IS MUCH MORE  DIFFICULT, AND THEY COME OUT AND  ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP, WHO IS  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE JOBS?  WE'RE GOING TO BUILD THE WALL,  STOPPING THEM FROM COMING FROM  IN. IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, IF I WIN AND I BECOME PRESIDENT, FIRST GET THE NOMINATION, AND THAT HAPPENED,  IF I BECOME PRESIDENT, I TOLD  THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT  WE ARE GOING TO STOP THIS CRAP  FROM COMING INTO YOUR STATE.  100%. 100%.   IT CAN BE DONE, AND  IT CAN BE DONE EVEN BEFORE THE WALL GOES UP.  THE WALL IS NECESSARY.  I ASKED THE BORDER CONTROL, ICE  FOLKS THAT ENDORSED ME, AND I ASKED THE PATROL FOLKS THAT  ENDORSED ME, HOW IMPORTANT IS  THE WALL? YOU KNOW, I AM SO COMMITTED TO  THE WALL.  I WAS PRETTY SURE THEY WERE  GOING TO SAY THIS, BUT I WAS NOT 100%.  THEY SAID, MR. TRUMP, IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR US TO DO OUR PROPER JOB.  WHICH MADE ME, YOU KNOW, GAVE ME  A LITTLE ADDITIONAL SECURITY, AS  FAR AS THE WALL IS CONCERNED. WE NEED THE WALL. WE HAVE TO STOP THE DRUGS. HEROIN, MANY DRUGS, WE HAVE TO STOP THE DRUGS FROM POURING IN. BELIEVE ME, IT IS POISONING OUR COUNTRY, POISONING OUR YOUTH. AND WE ARE GOING TO STOP IT, AND  WE ARE GOING TO STOP IT FAST.  LONG BEFORE THE WALL COMES UP. WE ARE GOING TO START THAT WALL FAST.  I DIDN'T BUILD FAST. BUT I WILL TELL YOU, LONG  BEFORE, WE ARE GOING TO STOP  THAT POISON FROM COMING INTO OUR  COUNTRY.  OK?  ONE  WE WILL DO ANOTHER QUESTION.  SHE GETS EASY ONES.  BY THE WAY, DO YOU SEE THE  DIFFERENCE?  I AM GETTING BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. WITH HER, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO  FIX THE ECONOMY? OF COURSE, THAT IS ACTUALLY A  MUCH TOUGHER THAN YOU UNDERSTAND, AND SHE DOESN'T HAVE  A CLUE, BUT YOU SEE THE  QUESTIONS I WAS GETTING.  LET'S HAVE A FUN  QUESTION.  THANK YOU. I THINK JUST THE RELATIONSHIP I  HAD WITH MY PARENTS.  YOU KNOW, MY FATHER BUILT HOUSES  IN BROOKLYN AND QUEENS, AND APARTMENTS. HE WAS A GREAT NEGOTIATOR. IT WAS NOT THAT HE TAUGHT ME, HE  WOULD BE ON THE TELEPHONE NEGOTIATING WITH THE PLUMBER OR ELECTRICIAN OR SHEET ROCKER, AND I WOULD HEAR THIS, AND I WOULD BE PLAYING WITH BLOCKS AT HIS KNEE ON THE FLOOR. I WOULD BE LISTENING.  AND IT WAS ALWAYS SO VIVID.  AND HE WAS ALWAYS NEGOTIATING. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT IS WHAT  WE NEED IN THIS COUNTRY, BECAUSE  PEOPLE ARE RUNNING AWAY WITH OUR  COUNTRY.  YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON, WHETHER IT IS THE BORDER,  WHETHER IT IS OUR DEPLETED MILITARY -- THE GREATEST PEOPLE  ON EARTH ARE OUR MILITARY  PEOPLE, BUT THEY HAVE OLD  EQUIPMENT. THEY SHOW FIGHTER JETS THAT ARE  18 YEARS OLD.  THEY ARE SO OLD THEY DON'T MAKE  THE PARTS ANYMORE.  THESE ARE FIGHTER JETS THAT OUR  PEOPLE ARE FLYING NOW, AND THEY  HAVE TO GO INTO PLAIN  GRAVEYARDS TO GET PARTS.  AND THEY HAVE TO GOING TO MUSEUMS TO GET PARTS, BECAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE THE PARTS  ANYMORE. NO, WE NEED A STRONG MILITARY. WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT.  WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF OUR  VETS.  WE NEED BORDERS.  WE NEED GREAT EDUCATION, GETTING  RID OF COMMON CORE, SO IMPORTANT.  WE NEED SO MANY THINGS.  AND BY THE WAY, ONE THING, I KNOW JOHNSON A NEW AND --  JOHNSON A NEW -- JOHN SUNUNU AND  A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE FELT THIS  WAS SO IMPORTANT WHEN IT CAME  OUT SO STRONGLY, UNITED STATES  SUPREME COURT.  WE LOST A GREAT JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA.  WE NEED GREAT JUSTICES WHO ARE  GOING TO UPHOLD OUR  CONSTITUTION. AND IF HILLARY CLINTON GETS IN, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A MUCH  DIFFERENT COUNTRY.  SO MANY PEOPLE FEEL THAT IS SO IMPORTANT.  I PERSONALLY FEEL IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS. WE HAVE TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY,  AND WE HAVE TO STOP PEOPLE FROM COMING IN FROM PARTS OF THE  WORLD WHERE THEY ARE LOOKING TO  DO US HARM.  BELIEVE ME, THEY ARE POURING IN.  AND HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO HAVE THEM COMING IN AT A RATE OF 550% MORE THAN PRESIDENT OBAMA. WE'RE GOING TO STOP IT. YOU KNOW THE STATEMENT, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AND IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN QUICKLY. SO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY.  OH, LOOK. THE WORLD STAIRS.    OF COURSE, IT IS BOSTON.","Donald Trump Town Hall Meeting in Sandown, New Hampshire"

THANK YOU. IT IS SO GREAT TO BE HERE IN WEB LOW, PUEBLO, COLORADO.  WE LOVE PUEBLO. AND OF THOSE TWO GENTLEMEN ARE  AMAZING MEN AND I WANT TO THANK  THEM FOR BEING WITH US. YOU KNOW, PUEBLO IS CALLED HOME  OF THE HEROES. DID YOU KNOW THAT?  BECAUSE OF YOUR PROUD TRADITION OF MILITARY SERVICE. PUEBLO IS THE HOME OF FOUR MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENTS.  I JUST GOT THE ENDORSEMENT OF 19 ALTOGETHER.  19. SO WHEN YOU HAVE 19, THAT'S , PRETTY GOOD. BUT YOU HAVE 4, THAT'S AMAZING.  AS PRESIDENT EISENHOWER SAID,  THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN THE  WATER OUT HERE. BECAUSE ALL OF YOU GUYS TURN OUT TO BE HEROES.  WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT'S GOING ON?  IS THERE SOMETHING IN THE WATER?  GIVE ME SOME OF THAT WATER. COLORADO IS HOME TO SIX MILITARY  BASES. WE ARE GOING TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT TRULY, TRULY STRONG AGAIN.  ANOTHER GREAT COLORADO LEGACY IS HUNTING AND FISHING.   MY SONS KNOW THAT VERY WELL.  THEY ARE HERE ALL THE TIME. WE ARE GOING TO CONSERVE YOUR  LAND AND SAVE YOUR SECOND  AMENDMENT, WHICH IS UNDER SIEGE.   THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN  THIS ROOM.  THIS IS VERY IMPRESSIVE. A GREAT HONOR.  ANOTHER GREAT RESOURCE HERE, ENERGY.  CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO  SHUT DOWN THE MINDS, SHUTDOWN SHALE, SHUTDOWN OIL AND NATURAL GAS.  WE ARE GOING TO END THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY AND WE ARE GOING TO PUT THE MINERS BACK TO WORK.   I'VE ALSO MADE CENTERPIECE THE  LARGEST MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUT  SINCE RONALD REAGAN AND THE  LARGEST REGULATORY REFORM IN  AMERICAN HISTORY. WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT.  HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO INCREASE THE TAXES VERY SUBSTANTIALLY.  AND SHE ADMITS IT.  AT LEAST SHE ADMITS IT.  THAT IS BECAUSE I KNOW HOW  OVERTAXED AND OVERREGULATED THE  WORKING PEOPLE AND COMPANIES HERE ARE. A CENTRAL ISSUE I WOULD LIKE TO  ADDRESS TODAY IS OUR BROKEN TAX CODE, AN ISSUE OF CONCERN TO ALL AMERICANS. ALONG WITH SECURING OUR BORDERS,  REBUILDING OR MILITARY, REDOING OUR TRADE DEALS, AND BRINGING  BACK JOBS -- AND THEY ARE SORT  OF ONE AND THE SAME -- FIXING  OUR BROKEN TAX CODE IS ONE OF  THE MAIN REASONS I RUNNING FOR  AM PRESIDENT.  I HAVE BEEN SAYING FROM THE  BEGINNING OF THIS CAMPAIGN HOW  RIDICULOUS, COMPLEX, AND, YES  UNFAIR THE TAX SYSTEM IS. ,IT IS AN UNFAIR SYSTEM. AND SO COMPLEX THAT VERY FEW  PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IT. FORTUNATELY, I UNDERSTAND.   THIS IS NOT THE FAULT OF THE IRS.  BUT THE POLITICAL CLASS THAT IS  OWNED OUTRIGHT BY THE SPECIAL  INTERESTS AND LOBBYISTS, BELIEVE ME.  IT'S THESE POLITICIANS WHO WROTE  THE TAX CODE AND ARE CONSTANTLY ADDING, REVISING, AND CHANGING  AN ALREADY OVER COMPLICATED SET OF LAWS, ALL AT THE BEHEST OF THEIR FAVORITE DONORS AND  SPECIAL INTERESTS WHO WANT  CERTAIN PROVISIONS PUT IN AND  THEY WON'T TAKE NO FOR AN  ANSWER. IT'S THOUSANDS OF PAGES LONG. THE AVERAGE AMERICAN WOULD NEED AN ARMY OF ACCOUNTANTS AND  LAWYERS TO WAIT THROUGH IT. -- TO WADE THROUGH IT. MANY SO-CALLED EXPERTS, DUE TO THE SHEER SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE CODE, DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT THESE PAGES REPRESENT. THESE ARE EXPERTS.  THEY GET PAID AND THEY DON'T  KNOW WHAT IT REPRESENTS.  DESPITE BEING A BIG BENEFICIARY  OF THE LAWS. -- IS SOMETHING UP AND TALKING ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME DESPITE , BEING A BIG BENEFICIARY OF THE  LAWS. BUT I'M NOT WORKING FOR YOU NOW. -- BUT I'M WORKING FOR YOU NOW. I'M NOT WORKING FOR TRUMP. AT  BELIEVE ME.   I UNDERSTAND THE TAX LAWS BETTER  THAN ALMOST ANYONE. WHICH IS I AM ONE THAT CAN TRULY  FIX THEM. I UNDERSTAND IT.  I CAN GET IT.  THAT IS WHAT I COMMIT TO DO. WE WANT FAIRNESS. WE WANT MONEY BROUGHT IN, AND WE  WANT MONEY TO BE SPENT WHEN IT  GOES OUT, BECAUSE THEY SPEND OUR  TAX DOLLARS SO UNFAIRLY AND  UNWISELY. REMEMBER THAT.  AS A BUSINESSMAN AND REAL ESTATE  DEVELOPER, I HAVE LEGALLY USED  THE TAX LAWS TO MY BENEFIT.  AND TO THE BENEFIT OF MY COMPANY.  MY INVESTORS AND MY EMPLOYEES. I MEAN, HONESTLY, I HAVE  BRILLIANTLY USED THOSE LAWS. I HAVE OFTEN SAID ON THE  CAMPAIGN TRAIL I HAVE A  FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY NO MORE TAX THAN IS LEGALLY  REQUIRED. LIKE ANYONE ELSE. OR PUT IT ANOTHER WAY, TO PAY AS  LITTLE TAX IS LEGALLY POSSIBLE.  I MUST TELL YOU, I HATE THE WAY  THEY SPEND OUR TAX DOLLARS.   BELIEVE ME, THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. AS A MAJOR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER IN THIS COUNTRY AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, I FACE AND NORMA'S  TAXES. CITY TAXES, STATE TAXES, SALES  TAXES, EXCISE TAXES, EMPLOYEE TAXIS -- EMPLOYEE TAXES.  IT'S MY CHANCE TO MINIMIZE THE OVERALL TAX BURDEN TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE, WHICH  ALLOWS ME TO REINVEST IN  NEIGHBORHOODS, IN WORKERS, AND  BUILD AMAZING PROPERTIES WHICH  YIELD TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN THE COMMUNITIES AND ALWAYS HELP. -- ALWAYS HELP OUR GREAT  PROVIDERS OF JOBS AND WE HAVE TO HELP OUR SMALL BUSINESSES.  THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. THE TORTOISE ALL ABOUT. THE NEWS MEDIA IS NOW OBSESSED  WITH AN ALLEGED TAX FILING FROM THE 1990'S AT THE END OF ONE OF  THE MOST BRUTAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY. IF YOU REMEMBER THE EARLY 90'S,  OTHER THAN 1928I WOULD SAY THERE -- OTHER THAN, I WOULD SAY 1928,  THERE WAS NOTHING CLOSE.  THE CONDITIONS FACING REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS BACK THEN WERE ALMOST AS BAD AS THE GREAT DEPRESSION OF 1929 AND FAR WORSE  THAN THE GREAT RECESSION OF  2008. NOT EVEN CLOSE.  WHAT HAD BEEN A BOOMING ECONOMY  IN THE ERA OF RONALD REAGAN  CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. AND THE BUSINESS LANDSCAPE CHANGED WITH IT.  BANK FAILURES, COLLAPSE, THE ABSOLUTE TOTAL DISRUPTION OF THE  SAVINGS AND LOAN INDUSTRY, AND  THE IMPLOSION OF THE RETAIL  MARKET AND REAL ESTATE IN  GENERAL, SOMETHING WE HAVE NEVER  SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. MANY BUSINESS PEOPLE, INCLUDING MANY OF MY COMPETITORS AND SOME OF MY FRIENDS, WERE NOT ABLE TO  SURVIVE. COMPANIES, JOBS, AND  OPPORTUNITIES WERE LOST AND LIES  WERE DESTROYED AS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE PUT OUT  OF WORK.  SOME OF THE BIGGEST AND  STRONGEST PEOPLE AND COMPANIES WENT ABSOLUTELY BANKRUPT, WHICH  I NEVER DID, BY THE WAY.  ARE YOU PROUD OF ME?  I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO USE THAT CARD, BUT I JUST DIDN'T. YES TODAY MY COMPANY IS BIGGER, , STRONGER, FAR GREATER ASSETS THEN IT EVER HAD BEFORE.  MORE PREMIUM PROPERTIES.  WE HAVE NEVER DONE BETTER, IT'S  THE STRONGEST WE HAVE EVER BEEN.  OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE EMPLOYED  THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF  PEOPLE, WHICH IS THE THING THAT  FRANKLY MAKES ME THE MOST HAPPY. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN BY CHANCE OR LUCK. IT HAPPENED BY ACTION AND TALENT. I WAS ABLE TO USE THE TAX LAWS  OF THIS COUNTRY AND MY BUSINESS ACCOUNT TO DIG OUT OF THE REAL ESTATE MESS.  YOU WOULD CALL IT A DEPRESSION. WHEN FEW OTHERS WERE ABLE TO DO  WHAT I DID. I'M A STAR.  THANK YOU. YOU ARE, TOO. THEY WERE AMAZING TIMES. IN THOSE MOST DIFFICULT TIMES, WHEN SOMEONE HAD THEIR BACKS TO THE WALL, I REACHED WITHIN MYSELF AND DELIVERED FOR MY  COMPANY, MY EMPLOYEES, MY FAMILY, AND THE COMMUNITIES  WHERE MY PROPERTIES EXISTED AND  I REALLY DELIVERED. THOSE WHO SPEND THEIR ENTIRE  LIVES WITHIN THE CONFINES OF  GOVERNMENT WORK AND KNOW  VIRTUALLY NOTHING OF BUSINESS FAILED TO UNDERSTAND THE SKILL,  DEDICATION, THE SHEER GRIT IT  TAKES FOR A COMPANY TO CLIMB OUT  OF THE ECONOMIC DEPRESSION THE  SCALE OF WHICH WE HAD IN THE  EARLY 1990'S.  PEOPLE LIKE MY OPPONENT, HILLARY  CLINTON, WHO IS ONLY --      FOLKS, LET'S WIN ON  NOVEMBER 8.  OK? ANYWAY, HER ONLY METHOD OF  MAKING MONEY IS BY SELLING  GOVERNMENT FAVORS AND BY  GRANTING ACCESS TO SPECIAL INTERESTS.  SHE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HOW  BUSINESSES SUCCEED AND GROW.  HILLARY HAS NEVER CREATED A  SINGLE JOB IN HER ENTIRE LIFE.  BY THE WAY, WE HAVE SOMEBODY WHO HAS.  WHERE IS BERNIE MARCUS?  WHERE IS PART -- WHERE IS  BERNIE. THE FOUNDER OF HOME DEPOT. GO TO HOME DEPOT. HE ONLY CREATED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS.  HOW MANY JOBS AS HOME DEPOT  PRODUCED NOW, BERNIE? MILLIONS?  MILLIONS? THAT'S A LOT OF JOBS AREA  SOMEBODY WHO PUT A LOT OF PEOPLE  TO WORK.  THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE,  HOME DEPOT IS A TERRIFIC COMPANY. BERNIE.  APPRECIATE IT.  THEY HAVEN'T HAD A SINGLE DOLLAR  OF VALUE, PEOPLE LIKE HILLARY,  FOR THE AMERICAN ECONOMY.  SHE HASN'T MADE AN HONEST DOLLAR  IN HER ENTIRE LIFE.  ALL THAT SHE DOES IS TAKE FROM  YOU, TAKE FROM THE COUNTRY.  THE SPECIAL INTERESTS AND  FOREIGN ACTORS AND ASTRONOMICAL  AMOUNTS THAT YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.  CORRUPTION OF THE HIGHEST ORDER.  WHILE I MADE MY MONEY AS A VERY  SUCCESSFUL PRIVATE BUSINESS  PERSON FOLLOWING THE LAW, ALL  THE WAY HILLARY CLINTON MADE HER  MONEY AS A CORRUPT PUBLIC  OFFICIAL, BREAKING THE LAW AND  PUTTING HER GOVERNMENT OFFICE UP  FOR SALE.  AND NOW SHE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. BY HER OWN ACCOUNT, HILLARY CLINTON LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE,  DEAD BROKE.  DEAD BROKE.   AND THEN -- REMEMBER? SHE BECAME A SENATOR FOR NEW YORK? REMEMBER THE JOBS SHE WAS GOING TO PRODUCE?  SHE NEVER PRODUCE THEM.  THEN SHE BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE. AND NOW SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAVE MADE OVER $200 MILLION, WITHOUT BUILDING A COUNTRY -- COMPANY OR CREATING A SINGLE THING OF VALUE.  DURING THE EARLY 90'S, AS COMPANIES WERE COLLAPSING ALL OVER THE PLACE, LEFT AND RIGHT, THE MEDIA AND POWERS THAT THE  SAID -- DONALD TRUMP, HE COULD  NEVER MAKE IT BACK.  I REMEMBER THE STORIES.  WE WERE ALL -- HOW MANY PEOPLE  WERE IN TROUBLE BACK THEN?  EVERYONE WAS IN TROUBLE.  THEY SAID I HAD BILLIONS OF  DOLLARS IN BORROWING, WHICH WAS  TRUE, AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IN PERSONAL GUARANTEES, WHICH WAS TRUE.  AND NO PATHWAY OUT.  WHICH IS FALSE.  THAT WAS A BAD TIME.  IT WAS AN UGLY TIME.  A LOT OF PEOPLE, YOU WILL NEVER  HEAR FROM THEM AGAIN.  I NEVER HAD ANY DOUBTS WHATSOEVER.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, I NEVER, EVER  GIVE UP OR EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT  GIVING UP.  THAT IS BECAUSE I KNEW IN MY  HEART THAT WHEN THE CHIPS ARE  DOWN, THAT'S WHEN I PERFORM THE  VERY BEST.  THAT IS ALWAYS WHEN I PERFORM  THE BEST.  IT'S WHEN I MAKE MY BEST  DECISIONS. DO YOU REMEMBER?  BERNIE SAYING THAT HILLARY  CLINTON HAS BAD JUDGMENT.  MY SINGLE BEST ASSET IS TEMPERAMENT. IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT  TEMPERAMENT, YOU COULD NEVER  HAVE ESCAPED THAT FINANCIAL  JUNGLE, THAT'S FOR SURE.  SINGLE GREATEST ASSET IS MY TEMPERAMENT.  AND I HAVE A TEMPERAMENT FOR  WINNING.  YOU HAVE TO WIN.  THE TEMPERAMENT OF ALL OF US IS  WINNING.  AND WHEN PEOPLE MAKE THE MISTAKE  OF UNDERESTIMATING ME, THAT IS WHEN THEY ARE REALLY IN FOR  THEIR BIGGEST SURPRISE. SAME THING FOR A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM.  REMEMBER THE PRIMARY? TRUMP IS RUNNING, STARVE THE APPRENTICE -- ""STAR OF ""THE APPRENTICE -- STAR OF ""THE APPRENTICE,"" HE'S NOT REALLY RUNNING.  NOW LOOK AT THIS MOVEMENT.   WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS  AMAZING.  NOW WE HAVE ONE PERSON LEFT.  CROOKED HILLARY. WE HAVE TO BEAT HER.  YOU HAVE TO GET OUT, MAKE CALLS.  JOKINGLY I LIKE TO SAY THAT --  IF YOU ARE SICK, IF YOU GET THE  ABSOLUTE WORST PROGNOSIS FROM  THE DOCTOR AND IT LOOKS LIKE  MAYBE YOU AREN'T EVEN GOING TO  MAKE IT, IT DOESN'T MAKE A DAM N BIT OF DIFFERENCE.  GET UP AND VOTE.   THE REASON I NEVER FELT  ENDANGERED -- I NEVER REALLY DID -- I NEVER DID DURING THE REAL  ESTATE DOWNTURN -- I GUESS I  DIDN'T READ THE STORIES.  I KNEW MYSELF. I KNEW MY BUSINESS.  I KNEW THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND  THE TAX CODE.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, I KNEW HOW TO  FIGHT.  THAT'S WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.  THAT IS WHAT I AM, A FIGHTER.  I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR YOU.  I'M NOT FIGHTING FOR ME ANYMORE.  I'M FIGHTING FOR YOU.  WITH MY KNOWLEDGE I KNEW THAT I  WOULD MAKE A COME BACK WITHOUT QUESTION.  I NEVER HAD A DOUBT IN MY MIND.  I DON'T EVEN THINK OF IT AS A  COME BACK.  WE HAD GOOD TIMES, TOUGH TIMES,  WE JUST KNEW THAT THINGS WERE  GOING TO BE FINE.  THAT IS WHY AM HERE TODAY.  THANK YOU. >>   AND I'M PRAYING FOR  YOU AND I LOVE YOU.  GREAT PEOPLE.  NOW I GET THE WHOLE HERO THING.  NOW I GET IT.   BUT THAT IS WHY I  HAVE LEFT PRIVATE BUSINESS. YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE TOLD ME I WOULD BE GOING -- DOING THIS. I WOULDN'T HAVE COMMENCED WITH THOSE INTERVIEWS.  I WOULD HAVE SAID THINGS  SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY. AND I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD AS GOOD A TIME IN LIFE.  AND WOULD HAVE MADE MY LIFE AS A  POLITICIAN OF IT EASIER. YOU KNOW, THESE PEOPLE, HOLIER THAN THOU, THEY NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THE BREAKFAST -- AROUND THE BREAKFAST TABLE.  THEY NEVER DO.  BILL AND HILLARY NEVER SAY  ANYTHING LIKE THIS.  CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THEY SAY?  WELL, THEY TALKED ABOUT  DEPLORABLES AND IRREDEEMABLES.  THE FLOOR BULL, IRREDEEMABLE.  RIGHT?  THEY TALK ABOUT THAT.  YOU ARE DEPLORABLE. YOU ARE IRREDEEMABLE. I THINK THAT IRREDEEMABLE MIGHT  BE WORSE.  EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT DEPLORABLE? AY YI YI. THESE ARE THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN  THIS ROOM.  WE HAVE SEEN HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.  THESE ARE THE GREATEST PEOPLE.  IMPORTANTLY, WE ARE GOING TO  MAKE A GREAT FOR ALL THE PEOPLE.  WE ARE TO MAKE A GREAT FOR ALL  THE PEOPLE.   BUT I'M DOING THIS AND I'M DOING  IT FOR A VERY SPECIFIC REASON.  BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT OUR  COUNTRY IS IN VERY, VERY BAD SHAPE.   THAT'S ALL RIGHT.  SOUNDS LIKE A NICE PERSON.  OH, OH.  I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE  COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES.  I SAID I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE HERE.  WHEN THEY WERE PLAYING WITH THE  MIC, BACK AND FORTH, I THOUGHT  THAT WAS THE COMMISSION. OF THE COMMISSION, LET'S SEE  WHAT HAPPENS ON SUNDAY AGAIN.   MY BIGGEST OPPONENT WAS THE MICROPHONE. AND NOW OUR COUNTRY IS IN NEED OF A MAJOR COMEBACK. NEEDS ONE NOW JUST ABOUT MORE  THAN EVER.  WE OWE $20 TRILLION IN DEBT,  DOUBLED DURING OBAMA'S PERIOD AS  PRESIDENT.   BUT THAT'S ONLY PART OF THE STORY. WE HAVE $100 TRILLION IN  UNFUNDED LIABILITY. THE BUDGET IS OUT OF CONTROL WITH ANNUAL DEFICITS. IN ADDITION BECAUSE OF THE INCOMPETENCE OF OUR LEADERS WE  RUN MASSIVE TRADE DEFICITS ON AN  ANNUAL BASIS. I WILL GET BURNING TO NEGOTIATE A COUPLE OF THESE TRADE DEALS. -- I WILL GET BERNIE TO  NEGOTIATE A COUPLE OF THESE TRADE DEALS.  YOU WILL FIND OUT.  WE NOW HAVE ALMOST $800 BILLION PER YEAR IN TRADE DEFICITS. YOU SAY TO YOURSELF -- WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE NEGOTIATING THESE DEALS?  OUR COUNTRY IS BROKE. IT'S BROKE.  THE WORST PART IS THAT WITH ALL  THE MONEY THAT WE SPEND SO  FOOLISHLY ALL OVER THE WORLD, WE  PROTECT OTHER COUNTRIES WITH  TREMENDOUS LOSSES. AND WE WANT TO PROTECT  COUNTRIES. BUT THEY SHOULD PAY US THE PROPER AMOUNT.   BUT THINK OF IT, WITH ALL OF THE  MONEY THAT WE SPEND, AND WITH 20  DOLLARS -- $20 TRILLION IN DEBT,  ALL THE TALK AND THE POLITICAL  NONSENSE, WE HAVE A DECAYING INFRASTRUCTURE, FAMINE SCHOOLS  AND RISING CRIME.  WE HAVE A DEPLETED MILITARY OF  GREAT PEOPLE.  AIRPLANES THAT ARE SO OLD, THEY  GO TO AIRPLANE GRAVEYARDS FOR  PART. THEY GO TO MUSEUMS BECAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE THE PARTS ANYMORE.  WE HAVE AN OPEN BORDER AND AN  ECONOMY THAT CANNOT CREATE  FULL-TIME, HIGH-PAYING JOBS.  OUR GREAT JOBS HAVE BEEN TAKEN.  WE WILL BUILD A WALL.  DON'T WORRY.   WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A WALL.  WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL.  DON'T WORRY.  WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL.  MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE  WALL.  THEY DON'T KNOW IT YET.  BUT THEY ARE GOING TO PAY FOR  THE WALL.   YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM  RIGHT HERE, BUT WE WILL HAVE  DRUGS STOP POURING INTO OUR  COUNTRY, DESTROYING OUR YOUTH,  POISONING OUR PEOPLE.  POISONING OUR PEOPLE.  WE ARE A DIVIDED NATION.  EACH WEEK IT SEEMS THAT WE ARE  GETTING MORE AND MORE DIVIDED.  WITH RACE RIOTS ON THE STREETS  ON A MONTHLY BASIS.  SOMEBODY SAID DON'T CALL THEM RACE RIOTS.  BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE.  RACE RIOTS.  IT'S HAPPENING MORE AND MORE.  IF YOU LOOK AT CHARLOTTE, A  GREAT CITY WHERE I HAVE  PROPERTY, A GREAT CITY,  DIFFERENT PLACES AROUND THE  COUNTRY, ST. LOUIS, FERGUSON,  BALTIMORE, CHICAGO. IN CHICAGO THOUSANDS OF , SHOOTINGS, THOUSANDS SINCE JANUARY. 4000 SHOOTINGS -- THINK OF IT --  SINCE JANUARY.  THIS WAS NOT THE AMERICA THAT  WAS HANDED DOWN TO US OR THE ONE  WE WANT TO LEAVE TO OUR CHILDREN.  IT IS CERTAINLY NOT THE AMERICA THAT WE WANT TO PASS DOWN TO OUR  GRANDCHILDREN.  BUT THIS IS THE AMERICA THAT WE  WILL HAVE IF WE DON'T TURN  THINGS AROUND STARTING IMMEDIATELY.  WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME, FOLKS.  WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. AND IF WE DON'T WIN THIS ELECTION, IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN. WHAT I SAY IS NOT LOST ON THE HOAX -- WHAT I SAY IS NOT LOST  ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  70% OF YOU BELIEVE THE COUNTRY  IS HEADED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO THE OTHER 30% ARE. I WANT TO MEET THEM. WE CANNOT HAVE ANOTHER FOUR  YEARS OF BARACK OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE WORSE. SHE WILL BE WORSE. WE CAN TURN OUR COUNTRY AROUND. BUT IF WE DON'T THEY COULD CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP RIGHT NOW, IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN.  THE FAILED POLITICAL  ESTABLISHMENT MUST GO. IT MUST GO FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR COUNTRY, YOUR FUTURE, AND THOSE THAT YOU LOVE THE MOST.  IN THE EARLY 1990'S THEY SPLASH  THE FRONT PAGES WITH STORIES ABOUT HOW DONALD TRUMP -- ME, THEY SAID I WAS FINISHED.  EVERYBODY SAID THAT I WAS DONE. THERE WERE FRONT-PAGE ARTICLES IN ""THE WALL STREET JOURNAL,"" AND ""THE NEW YORK TIMES,"" AMONG MANY OTHERS. THEY WERE THRILLED AND DELIGHTED -- CAN YOU BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE?  THEY'RE GOING CRAZY.   THEY SAY 1990'S,  SAYING HERE I AM -- CAN I EVER  GET RID OF THIS GUY? THEY WERE THRILLED TO WRITE THE STORIES.  THEY SAID I WAS FINISHED. THE ONLY PERSON THAT DIDN'T THINK I WAS IN TROUBLE WAS A GUY NAMED DONALD J.  TRUMP.  I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS IN TROUBLE.  I SORT OF DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY  WERE TALKING ABOUT.  DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?  POWER OF POSITIVE THINKING, BUT  I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE  TALKING ABOUT.  AS I GREW, I BORROWED MONEY TO  GROW THE COMPANY.  BIG MONEY FROM BIG BANKS.  WHEN THE BOTTOM FELL OUT OF THE  REAL ESTATE MARKET, I HAVE THIS  LARGE AMOUNT OF DEBT THAT STAY  THE SAME AND THE VALUE OF ASSETS  PLUMMETED. I WAS YOUNG AND YOU HAVE TO LEARN.  I LEARNED.  I WORK REALLY HARD.  I KNEW HOW TO USE THE TAX CODE  TO REBUILD MY COMPANY WHEN  OTHERS DIDN'T.  I FULLY UNDERSTOOD THE BANKS,  THE BANKERS, AND HOW TO DEAL  WITH THEM.  MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE TAX CODE  GIVE ME A TREMENDOUS ADVANTAGE  OVER THOSE WHO DIDN'T HAVE A  CLUE ABOUT IT, INCLUDING MANY OF  MY COMPETITORS, WHO LOST  EVERYTHING THEY HAD NEVER TO BE  HEARD FROM AGAIN. SOME PEOPLE THAT I KNEW WERE GOOD, DOING A GOOD JOB.  NEVER EVER TO BE HEARD FROM  AGAIN. NOW THEY ARE GONE, AND I'M HERE,  READY TO TURN THINGS AROUND FOR  OUR COUNTRY.  I'M GOING TO DO IT.   THE EARLY 90'S WAS A VERY TOUGH TIME FOR THE WORLD. BUT IN TOUGH TIMES YOU NEED VERY TOUGH AND VERY SMART PEOPLE. THESE ARE TOUGH TIMES FOR AMERICA. I WILL TELL YOU, WE NEED TOUGH AND SMART LEADERSHIP. NOT PEOPLE WHO TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR, BUT PEOPLE WHO TELL YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO HEAR. WE MUST NEVER ALLOW CORRUPT  CAREER POLITICIANS LIKE THE  CLINTONS EVER TO GET BACK INTO  THE WHITE HOUSE AGAIN.   THESE TOUGH TIMES  WERE WHEN I PERFORMED MY BEST.  THE ECONOMY, THE BANKS, THEY  WERE COLLAPSING.  I ENJOYED WAKING UP EVERY DAY TO  GO TO BATTLE.  SURVIVE UNTIL 95 AND YOU WILL BE OK.  I GET UP TO TAKE ON THE  FINANCIAL ESTABLISHMENT ON  BEHALF OF MY COMPANY, MY  EMPLOYEES, MY FAMILY, MYSELF,  AND WIN.  THAT'S WHAT WE DID.  I WON, I WON, AND I KEPT ON WINNING.  UNTIL THIS DAY.  ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK ALL  THE EVIL WEEK COMPETED AGAINST  AND ASK THEM -- HOW DID TRUMP -- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK ALL  OF THE 17 PEOPLE WE COMPETED AGAINST AND ASK THEM -- HOW DID TRUMP DO.  THEY WILL SAY, HE WON.  BUT THAT'S THE THINKING THAT WE  NEED FOR OUR COUNTRY.  WHEN WE ARE NEGOTIATING TRADE  DEALS, MILITARY DEALS, ECONOMIC  DEALS ON THE BEHALF OF THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE.  WE NEED GREAT PEOPLE NEGOTIATING OUR DEALS FOR US.  WE HAVE THE GREATEST NEGOTIATORS AND GREATEST IS NICE PEOPLE IN  THE WORLD AND WE USE POLITICAL HACKS TO NEGOTIATE OUR DEALS.  NOT ANYMORE, WE'RE NOT.  NOT ANYMORE. PUT ME INTO THE BOARDROOM AS  YOUR REPRESENTATIVES AND I  PROMISE I WILL DELIVER. HILLARY CLINTON IS IN IT ONLY  FOR HERSELF, HER DAUGHTERS, ENTER SPECIAL INTERESTS. I'M PROVIDING FOR AMERICA. MANY PEOPLE.   MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID OVER THE YEARS THAT I PERFORM BETTER UNDER PRESSURE THAN ANYONE THEY'VE EVER SEEN. I PROVEN IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO RIGHT NOW.  WHEN THE PRESSURE IS ON, WHEN THE ODDS ARE STACKED AGAINST ME  AND YOU, WHEN PEOPLE SAY THAT IT CAN'T BE DONE, THAT IS WHEN WE GET STARTED. WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THINGS AROUND.  THE THING THAT MOTIVATES ME THE  MOST IS WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME THAT  SOMETHING IS IMPOSSIBLE.  FOR ME, IMPOSSIBLE IS JUST A  STARTING POINT.  THAT'S WHEN YOU BEGIN.   AND REMEMBER, WITH $20 TRILLION IN DEBT AND $100 TRILLION IN UNFUNDED LIABILITY,  A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.  WE ARE SITTING ON A BIG, FAT, UGLY BUBBLE.  OBAMA DOESN'T ALLOW THE FED TO  RAISE INTEREST RATES.  WHEN THEY GO, YOU WATCH WHAT HAPPENS.  IT WILL BE VERY UNATTRACTIVE.  HE WILL BE OUT PLAYING GOLF  SOMEPLACE.  YOU KNOW WHAT?  THEY ARE WRONG AND WHAT THEY ARE  DOING AND IT'S UNFAIR TO THE  PEOPLE, UNFAIR TO THE COUNTRY  AND THEY ARE SO WRONG.  FROM THE DEPTHS OF THAT TERRIBLE  REAL ESTATE DEPRESSION I CREATED  A COMPANY WORTH BILLION'S AND  BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND CREATED  TENS OF THOUSANDS AND CREATED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF  JOBS.  TOGETHER WE REVITALIZED NEIGHBORHOODS, REJUVENATED COMMUNITIES, AND HIRED THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF WORKERS.  ON NOVEMBER 8, AMERICA'S COME  BACK BEGINS, AND WE NEED A COME  BACK. AND WE ARE GOING TO RISE UP FROM OUR PRESENT CHALLENGES BIGGER  AND BETTER AND STRONGER THAN  EVER BEFORE.   A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID,  WHY ARE YOU GOING TO PUEBLO?  EVERYTHING ABOUT PUEBLO SAYS  WINNER, INCLUDING WHAT DWIGHT  EISENHOWER SAID LONG AGO.  AND THEY SAID, DO YOU THINK THEY  WILL LIKE YOU IN PUEBLO?  I SAID, I THINK SO.  THEY SAID, WELL COME YOU HAVE A  LOT OF HISPANICS AND LATINOS IN PUEBLO.  I SAID THAT'S WHY THEY ARE GOING  TO LIKE ME, ACTUALLY.  BELIEVE ME.  WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS  HAPPENING WITH THE  AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, WHEN  YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING  WITH THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY,  VERY, VERY UNFAIR.  VERY, VERY UNFAIR.   THE PEOPLE IN PUEBLO  KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO REBUILD  THIS COUNTRY.  FRIEND OR FOE.  HE'S GOT A VERY WEAK VOICE, SO  YOU CAN LET HIM STAY.  BUT JUST BE GOOD, SIR.  BE NICE. WE ALL LOVE YOU.  YOU'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE. YOU KNOW, THE SANDERS PEOPLE HAD  SO MUCH MORE SPIRIT AND VIM AND  VIGOR THAN THE HILLARY PEOPLE.  THE HILLARY PEOPLE ARE NOT IN  THE SAME CATEGORY. IF BERNIE SANDERS HAD NOT MADE THE DEAL WITH THE DEVIL, HE WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN IN THE  HISTORY OF POLITICS IS A VERY  RARE AND UNIQUE PERSON.  BUT WHEN HE MADE THAT DEAL, AND I KNOW THAT HE WISHED HE DIDN'T, HE HAD AN EVENT RECENTLY WHERE  150 PEOPLE SHOWED UP TO HEAR HIM TALK.  I WILL SAY THIS, WE'VE ALWAYS  HAD BY FAR THE BIGGEST CROWDS.  BUT HE WAS SECOND.  BUT HE MADE A DEAL WITH THE  DEVIL AND HIS SUPPORTERS ARE NO  LONGER REALLY HIS SUPPORTERS ANY  LONGER. THAT I CAN TELL YOU.  ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BERNIE  SANDERS AND I AGREED ON IS  TRADE.  AND TRADE IS SOMETHING THAT IS  SO SAD IN THIS COUNTRY, WHAT IS  HAPPENING, HOW JOBS ARE BEING TAKEN.  THE DIFFERENCE IS, I CAN DO  SOMETHING ABOUT IT, AND MAKE A  BAD DEAL INTO A A GREAT DEAL.  ALL HE KNEW IS, IT WAS BAD.  THIS IS A CITY WITH A RICH  IMMIGRANT HISTORY AND A RICH  LATINO HISTORY.  THE LATINOS LOVE TRUMP, RIGHT?  THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO MUCH TO  THIS COUNTRY AND THIS STATE.  THROUGH THE PEOPLE OF PUEBLO -- THANK YOU.  AND THEIR FAMILIES, THEY'VE COME  FROM ALL REGIONS OF THE WORLD.  YOU ARE UNITED BY THIS ONE VERY  IMPORTANT FACTOR.  YOU ARE ALL AMERICANS.    AND AS AMERICANS, YOU  ARE ENTITLED TO THE SAME  PROTECTIONS AS EVERY OTHER  AMERICAN GETS.  EVERYONE LIVING LAWFULLY INSIDE  OUR BORDERS ARE ENTITLED TO THE  SAME THINGS, SAFE COMMUNITIES, A  GREAT EDUCATION, AND ACCESS TO  HIGH PAYING JOBS AND REALLY GOOD JOBS.  AND THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.  THIS IS THE CHANGE THAT I WILL DELIVER.  HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN THERE  FOR 30 YEARS, DELIVERING NOTHING  BUT TALK AND FAILURE.  THE OTHER NIGHT WHEN WE WERE AT  THE DEBATE, I NOTICED MORE THAN  EVER BEFORE, SHE SAYS SHE'S  GOING TO THIS AND THIS AND THAT.  I SAID TO MYSELF, WHY HASN'T SHE  BEEN DOING IT FOR 30 YEARS, RIGHT?  JUST TALK.  HER POLICIES HAVE WROUGHT DEATH  AND DESTRUCTION OVERSEAS AND POVERTY AT HOME.  SHE HAS BROUGHT MASSIVE POVERTY TO EVERYONE, BUT ESPECIALLY FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO CITIZENS. SHE COMES IN, TRIES TO GET THEIR VOTE, ALTHOUGH I MUST TELL YOU,  THE ENTHUSIASM FOR HER IS VERY SMALL. DON KING, THE GREAT BOXING PROMOTER, WHO ENDORSES ME, SAID DONALD, THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS LOVE YOU. DON KING.  BIG DON. HERE'S A MAN, WHETHER YOU LIKE  HIM OR NOT, THAT'S A SMART COOKIE, A TOUGH COOKIE, AND HE HAS DONE A JOB.  HE HAS DONE JOB.  BUT HE SAID YOU ARE GOING TO SEE  A BIG SURPRISE IN NOVEMBER. IN THIS CASE HE WAS TALKING  ABOUT THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS.  HE SAID YOU ARE GOING TO SEE A  BIG SURPRISE BECAUSE SO MANY  AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE LOVE YOU  AND THEY WANT YOU TO REALLY HELP  THEM OUT IN TERMS OF THE INNER  CITIES IN PARTICULAR, WHERE IT  IS SO DANGEROUS, WHERE EDUCATION  IS SO BAD, WHERE JOBS ARE  NONEXISTENT, WHERE YOUTH CANNOT  GET JOBS.  SO I WANT TO THANK DON KING AND  SO MANY OTHERS FOR THEIR ENDORSEMENT.  WE HAVE SO MANY OTHERS, AND SO  MANY REVERENDS AND PASTORS,  BISHOP JACKSON FROM DETROIT,  INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.  PASTOR DARRELL SCOTT. SO MANY, AND I'M SO HONORED BY IT. BELIEVE ME, I AM HONORED BY IT. DON SAID THAT HILLARY CLINTON TAKES THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE  FOR GRANTED.  HERE IS THE BAD NEWS, I DON'T  THINK YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO  GO OUT AND VOTE FOR HER.  THIS IS NOT BARACK OBAMA WHERE  THEY REALLY HAD SPIRIT TO VOTE  FOR HIM.  NOBODY HAS SPIRIT.  REMEMBER SHE CALLED  AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE YOUTH  SUPER PREDATORS?  WHO WANTS TO VOTE FOR HER, SHE'S  NOT GOING TO DO THE JOB ANYWAY.  SHE OPPOSES SCHOOL CHOICE AND  SHE WANTS TO TRAP AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO CHILDREN INTO THE FAILING GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS. BECAUSE SHE IS GETTING A LOT OF  MONEY FROM THE TEACHERS UNIONS.  SHE DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE CHOICE  AND SHE DOESN'T WANT TO END COMMON CORE THAT WE CAN BRING  EDUCATION LOCALLY, WHICH IS VERY  IMPORTANT.  SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO THAT.  WE ARE GOING TO GET POOR  MINORITIES -- I'M TELLING YOU,  THE COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL  DEBATES IS OPERATING THIS MICROPHONE. EVERY TIME THE SECRET SERVICE HEARS THAT SOUND, THEY GO, WHOA. THAT COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES, WHAT A JOKE THEY ARE. I GOT TO GO THROUGH THEM ON SUNDAY NIGHT AGAIN? AND BY THE WAY, MIKE PENCE ON TUESDAY NIGHT, HE HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. TUESDAY NIGHT. TUESDAY NIGHT. WE ARE GOING TO GET POOR MINORITY CHILDREN OUT OF FAILING SCHOOLS AND INTO THE  PUBLIC-PRIVATE CHARTER OR MAGNET  SCHOOL OF THEIR CHOICE.  IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG  DIFFERENCE.  I WILL TELL YOU, THE LATINO  CHILDREN, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN, IT'S GOING TO BE SOME  DIFFERENCE, BELIEVE ME.  HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTS  OBAMACARE AND WANTS TO EXPAND IT.  AND OBAMACARE IS AN ABSOLUTE  DISASTER.  HOW MUCH HAVE THEY RAISED YOUR  PREMIUMS THIS YEAR?  HOW ABOUT TRIPLE, QUADRUPLE?  IT'S HORRIBLE, AND IT'S GOING TO  DIE OF ITS OWN WEIGHT, BUT WE  ARE GOING TO TERMINATE IT AND  REPLACE IT AND IT WILL BE SO  MUCH BETTER AND SO MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE.  PREMIUMS IN COLORADO ARE SET TO  GO UP ANOTHER 20%.  THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THIS  DISASTER IS TO VOTE FOR TRUMP. I'M TELLING YOU TO VOTE FOR  TRUMP.  THEY'LL BE GOING DOWN.  HILLARY CLINTON ALSO SUPPORTS THE TERRIBLE TRADE DEALS LIKE BILL CLINTON'S NAFTA AND CHINA'S  ENTRY INTO THE WORLD TRADE  ORGANIZATION, AND NEXT, SHE  WANTS TO SUPPORT TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP, THE DEAL SHE CALLED  THE GOLD STANDARD, THAT SHE LIED  TO DURING THE DEBATE. SHE SAID SHE NEVER CALLED IT THE  GOLD STANDARD, AND LESTER HOLT  KEPT QUESTIONING ME ON  EVERYTHING, BUT HE NEVER  QUESTIONED HER ON THAT.  RIGHT? AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A LIE.  SHE CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD,  AND SHE WILL APPROVE IT IF SHE  GETS IN.  BUT IF SHE GETS IN, YOU PEOPLE  HAVE MADE ONE BAD MISTAKE, I CAN  TELL YOU. COLORADO HAS LOST MORE THAN ONE IN SEVEN MANUFACTURING JOBS  SINCE NAFTA AND CHINA DEALS. BUT WHILE YOU HAVE LOST OUT, HILLARY CLINTON HAS RAKED IN CASH FROM HER CONTRIBUTORS. SHE AND BILL HAVE MADE $150 MILLION IN SPEECHES, AND SHE'S A  BAD SPEAKER, TO SPECIAL INTERESTS. AND SHE IS A BAD SPEAKER -- TO SPECIAL INTERESTS.  THEY GAVE 39 SPEECHES TO BE -- BIG BANKS INCLUDING $2 , MILLION IN SPEAKING FEES FROM GOLDMAN SACHS.  THE CLINTONS RECEIVED ANOTHER $2  MILLION FROM US WITH BANK AFTER -- FROM A SWISS BANK AFTER  HILLARY NEGOTIATED A FAVORABLE  SETTLEMENT FOR THEM AS SECRETARY  OF STATE.  CROWD CHANTING ""LOCK HER UP""]  TO HIDE HER  CORRUPTION, HILLARY CLINTON PUTS  HER E-MAILS ON IT ILLEGAL SECRET  SERVER, OPEN TO FOREIGN HACKING.  THEN SHE DELETED AND BLEACHED  33,000 E-MAILS AFTER A  CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENA TO HIDE  THEM FROM THE PUBLIC.  SHE LIES TO CONGRESS UNDER OH  AND HER RINGLEADERS TOOK THE  FIFTH AMENDMENT AND GOT IMMUNITY DEALS. EXPLAIN THAT IN SO MANY WAYS, IT  ONE.  IS WORSE THAN WATERGATE. THE INVESTIGATION OF HILLARY CLINTON WAS RIGGED AND IT'S A  SHAME, AND IT'S ONE OF THE SETTLERS THINGS THAT HAS EVER  TAKEN PLACE IN OUR NATION,  BELIEVE ME, WHAT HAS GONE ON.  WE HAVE BECOME A BANANA REPUBLIC.  YOU KNOW WHAT? WE HAVE.  TODAY WE LEARNED THAT THE FBI  MADE A SIDE DEAL WITH CLINTON TOP AIDES TO DESTROY THEIR  LAPTOPS. DID YOU KNOW THIS?  LET ME REPEAT. THE FBI REPORTEDLY MADE A DEAL TO DESTROY THE LAPTOPS OF  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IMPLICATED  IN A MASSIVE CRIMINAL COVER-UP.  I THINK YOU HAVE A LOT OF GREAT  PEOPLE IN THE FBI, AND YOU DO,  INDEED. I THINK THEY ARE EXTREMELY UPSET AT WHAT IS GOING ON.  HILLARY CLINTON IS THE  RINGLEADER OF A CRIMINAL  ENTERPRISE IT HAS CORRUPTED OUR  GOVERNMENT AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL,  AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE ONE  CHANCE TO STOP IT, BY SHOWING UP  IN VOTING ON NOVEMBER 8.  PEOPLE HAVE HAD IT WITH THE  YEARS AND DECADES OF CLINTON  CORRUPTION. THIS IS THE YEAR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. THE CLINTONS ARE THE SORDID  ASPECT WE ARE TOGETHER AS A MOVEMENT, ALL OF US COME OUTSIDE OF THIS AREA, ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, WE ARE THE BRIGHT FUTURE. NOW, ANOTHER ISSUE I WANT TO ADDRESS TODAY, ONLY, IS IMMIGRATION. AS I MENTIONED, PUEBLO IS FILLED  WITH WONDERFUL, HARD-WORKING IMMIGRANTS. IT'S THESE HARD-WORKING IMMIGRANTS WHO STAND TO LOSE THE MOST FROM OUR OPEN BORDER IMMIGRATION POLICY.  ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND BROKEN  THESE OF PROGRAMS TAKE JOBS  DIRECTLY FROM LATINO AND HISPANIC WORKERS LIVING HERE LAWFULLY TODAY.  YOU KNOW THAT.  THEY ARE TAKING YOUR JOBS. IT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BRINGS  WITH IT MASSIVE CRIME AND MASSIVE DRUGS, INCLUDING A  TERRIBLE HEROIN PROBLEM RIGHT  HERE IN COLORADO.  YOU HAVE A BIG PROBLEM.  SO WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A  BORDER WALL, -- WHAT?   WE ARE GOING TO BUILD  A WALL AND WE ARE GOING TO STOP  THE DRUGS, THE GANGS, THE  VIOLENCE, FROM POURING INTO COLORADO.  WE'VE GOT A LOT OF BAD PEOPLE  THAT CAME IN.  WE HAVE GREAT PEOPLE THAT CAME  IN, BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF GANG  MEMBERS, WE HAVE A LOT OF  DRUGLORDS, WE HAVE A LOT OF DRUG  SELLERS.  WE ARE GOING TO SHIP THEM THE  HELL OUT, OK? IMMEDIATELY.  WE ARE GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE  SANCTUARY CITIES THAT HAVE LED  TO THE PREVENTABLE DEATHS OF SO MANY. CASES LIKE A WOMAN MURDERED BY  A FIVE-TIME DEPORTED ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANT WHO SHOULD NEVER HAVE  BEEN HERE.  OR CASES LIKE SARAH ROOTS KILLED , BY AN IMMIGRANT RELEASED AT  THE BORDER BY PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THEN RELEASED AGAIN AFTER  THE KILLING.  THERE ARE OVER 2 MILLION  CRIMINAL ALIENS IN THIS COUNTRY,  AND WE ARE GOING TO GET THEM  OUT, AND GET THEM OUT FAST.  TO THE CARTELS, THE GANGS, THE  DRUG DEALERS, I HAVE A SIMPLE  MESSAGE TO YOU.  YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED, AND YOUR  REIGN OF CRIME WILL SOON COME  CRASHING TO ENHANCE. -- WILL SOON COME CRASHING TO AN  END. WE ALSO HAVE TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE FROM TERRORISM.  THE TERRORISTS WHO PLANTED THE BONDS IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY AND WHO CARRIED OUT THE MALL STABBING IN MINNESOTA, YOU ALL SAW THAT, WERE FOREIGN NATIONALS ADMITTED INTO OUR COUNTRY, AS  WAS THE MALL SHOOTER IN WASHINGTON. OR LOOK AT CASES LIKE THE BOSTON BOMBERS, OR THE SAN BERNARDINO SHOOTINGS, HERE ON A FIANCEE VISA FROM SAUDI ARABIA. FIANCEE -- NICE VISA.  KILLED 14 PEOPLE THAT GAVE HIM -- GAVE THEM A BABY SHOWER A SHORT WHILE BEFORE, AND SHE KILLED THEM.  NOT ONLY KILLED THEM, BUT MANY,  MANY HORRIBLY WOUNDED TO THIS  DAY. OR THE ORLANDO SHOOTING, THE SON  OF A TALIBAN SUPPORTER FROM AFGHANISTAN. TERRORISTS ARE INFILTRATING OUR COUNTRY. NOW, HILLARY CLINTON ONCE A 550%  INCREASE IN SYRIAN REFUGEES AND  COUNTLESS MORE REFUGEES FROM ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST. I WANT TO KEEP YOUR FAMILY SAFE. MY JOB IS NOT TO REPRESENT FOREIGN COUNTRIES. MY JOB IS TO REPRESENT THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. PUTTING YOUR JOBS, YOUR WAGES, AND YOUR SECURITY FIRST AREA  AMERICA FIRST, REMEMBER THAT.  AMERICA FIRST.

THANK YOU.   WE ARE GOING TO MAKE  AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.   WE ARE. I AM THRILLED TO BE HERE  TONIGHT. BEAUTIFUL CITY. MANNHEIM.  I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, WE WILL  WIN THE GREAT STATE OF  PENNSYLVANIA. I WENT TO SCHOOL IN PENNSYLVANIA.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN PENNSYLVANIA. WE ARE GOING TO WIN BACK THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE ARE GOING TO  BE SO HAPPY. WE ARE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY AND  WE ARE GOING TO AGAIN BE PROUD  OF OUR COUNTRY. WE WILL BE PROUD. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE ON THE CORRUPT MEDIA, THE POWERFUL LOBBYISTS, AND THE SPECIAL INTERESTS THAT HAVE STOLEN YOUR JOBS, HERE FACTORIES IN YOUR  FUTURE. THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED. WE ARE GOING TO STOP HILLARY CLINTON FROM CONTINUING TO RATE  THE INDUSTRY -- RAID THE INDUSTRY FROM YOUR STATE FOR HER  PROFIT. HILLARY CLINTON HAS COLLECTED  MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE  SAME GLOBAL CORPORATIONS SHIPPING YOUR JOBS IN YOUR DREAMS TO OTHER COUNTRIES. YOU KNOW IT AND EVERYBODY ELSE  KNOWS IT.  THAT IS WHY CLINTON WOULD 100% APPROVE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP, A TOTAL DISASTEROUS  TRADE DEAL. SHE CALLED THE DEAL ""THE GOLD  STANDARD."" THE TTP WILL BRING ECONOMIC  DEVASTATION TO PENNSYLVANIA AND  OUR CAMPAIGN IS AMERICA'S ONE  AND ONLY CHANCE TO STOP THAT AND  LOTS OF OTHER BAD THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY. AND SHE LIED ABOUT THE GOLD STANDARD THE OTHER NIGHT AT THE DEBATE.  SHE SAYS SHE DID NOT SAY IT.  SHE SAID IT. WE DON'T WANT TO STOP THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP, AND IF  WE DON'T, BILLIONS -- REMEMBER  THIS. WE DON'T STOP IT, BILLIONS AND  ALIENS OF JOBS AND WEALTH WILL  BE VACUUMED OUT OF PENNSYLVANIA  AND SENT TO THESE OTHER COUNTRIES JUST LIKE NAFTA WAS A DISASTER. THIS WILL BE A DISASTER. FRANKLY I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE  AS BAD AS NAFTA. THEY CAN'T GET ANY WORSE THAN  THAT. SIGNED BY BILL CLINTON. ALL OF US HERE IN THIS MASSIVE ROOM TONIGHT CAN PREVENT THIS  FROM HAPPENING. TOGETHER WE WILL STOP TPP AND WE  CAN AND THE FACT OF AMERICAN  JOBS AND PROSPERITY. -- THEFT OF AMERICAN JOBS AND  PROSPERITY. ONE MAN -- WE HAVE TO DO IT.  IT IS TIME. IT IS TIME WE BRING OUR COUNTRY  BACK. IT IS TIME WE ACT LIKE  INTELLIGENT PEOPLE. IT IS TIME WE DON'T LET MEXICO  AND ALL THESE OTHER COUNTRIES TAKE OUR JOBS AND THAT IS WHAT  THEY ARE DOING.  YOU LOOK HERE, THE MINERS. WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR MINERS. WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR  STEELWORKERS. WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR FACTORIES AND OUR MANUFACTURERS.  I KNEW ONE MAN -- I'M NOT A BIG  FAN. ONE MAN THEY KNEW THE DANGERS AND THE DANGERS OF TPP WAS BERNIE SANDERS.  CRAZY BERNIE.  HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING. ONLY ONE THING, AND THAT WAS  TRADE. HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT IT BECAUSE HE  KNEW WE WERE GETTING RIPPED OFF  BUT HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO  ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  WE ARE GOING TO DO A LOT ABOUT  IT. WE WILL HAVE THE HIGHWAYS  RUNNING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF TRADE, BUT IT WILL COME INTO OUR COUNTRY.  WE ARE GOING TO START BENEFITING OUR COUNTRY. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT IS A  ONE-WAY ROAD TO TROUBLE. OUR JOBS LEAVE US, OUR MONEY  LEAVES US. WITH MEXICO WE GET THE DRUGS. THEY GET THE CASH.  THAT SIMPLE.  BY THE WAY, BY THE WAY WE ARE  GOING TO HAVE A VERY, VERY POWERFUL, STRONG SOUTHERN  BORDER. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE DRUGS STOP  POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY.   AND WE WILL BUILD THE WALL --  WE ARE GOING TO STOP THE DRUGS FROM POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY  AND POISONING OUR YOUTH, AND  PLENTY OF OTHER PEOPLE. AND WE ARE GOING TO HELP ALL THE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE SO HORRIBLY ADDICTED TO WHAT IS COMING IN. WE ARE GOING TO STOP IT AND WE  ARE GOING TO STOP IT FAST. WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL? >> MEXICO!  100%. THEY MAY NOT KNOW IT YET, BUT  THEY ARE PAYING. BELIEVE ME, THEY ARE PAYING. THEY HAVE NOT FIGURED THAT ONE  OUT YET. HILLARY CLINTON IS CONTROLLED BY  GLOBAL SPECIAL INTERESTS. SHE IS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF BERNIE ON THE TRADE ISSUE. SHE IS TOTALLY ON THE OPPOSITE  SIDE OF BERNIE. A NEW AUDIOTAPE HAS SURFACED JUST YESTERDAY FROM ANOTHER ONE OF HILLARY'S HIGHROLLER FUNDRAISERS. SHOWS HER DEMEANING AND MOCKING BERNIE SANDERS AND ALL OF HIS  SUPPORTERS.   I WILL TELL YOU  SOMETHING.  WE HAVE A MUCH BIGGER MOVEMENT AND BERNIE SANDERS EVER HAD. TRUE. IT'S TRUE. WE HAVE MUCH BIGGER CROWDS THAN BERNIE SANDERS EVER HAD. IT'S TRUE. AND WE HAVE A MORE IMPORTANT MOVEMENT THAN BERNIE SANDERS  EVER HAD. WE ARE GOING TO SAVE OUR  COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO SAVE OUR  COUNTRY.  BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT BERNIE SANDERS WOULD HAVE LEFT A GREAT, GREAT LEGACY HAD HE NOT MADE THE DEAL WITH THE DEVIL. HE REALLY WOULD HAVE LEFT A  GREAT LEGACY. NOW HE SHOWS UP AND 120 PEOPLE COME AND HEAR HIM TALK. BERNIE SANDERS WOULD'VE LEFT A  GREAT LEGACY HAD HE NOT MAKE THE  DEAL. HAD HE HELD HIS HEAD HIGH AND WALKED AWAY. HE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE PERHAPS FROM US, BUT WE WANT TO GET  ALONG WITH EVERYBODY. WE WILL UNITE THE COUNTRY. BUT WITH BERNIE SANDERS DID TO HIS SUPPORTERS WAS VERY, VERY  UNFAIR. THEY ARE REALLY NOT HIS  SUPPORTERS ANY LONGER. AND THEY ARE NOT GOING TO  SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON.  I REALLY BELIEVE A LOT OF THOSE  PEOPLE ARE COMING OVER, AND LARGELY BECAUSE OF TRADE, COLLEGE EDUCATION, LOTS OF OTHER  THINGS. BUT LARGELY BECAUSE OF TRADE. THEY ARE COMING OVER TO OUR  SIDE. YOU WATCH. YOU WATCH.  ESPECIALLY AFTER HILLARY MOCKS ALL THOSE PEOPLE BY ATTACKING HIM AND HIS SUPPORTERS AS LIVING  IN THEIR PARENTS BASEMENTS AND TRAPPED IN DEBT IN CAREERS. THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY ARE. SHE DESCRIBES MANY OF THEM AS IGNORANT, AND THEY WANT THE  UNITED STATES TO BE MORE LIKE  SCANDINAVIA, BUT HALF THE PEOPLE  DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS AND A  REALLY SARCASTIC TONE. SHE IS A SARCASTIC WOMAN.  TO SUM UP, AND I WILL TELL YOU  THE OTHER THING, SHE'S AN  INCOMPETENT WOMAN.  I HAVE SEEN IT. SHE IS AN INCOMPETENT WOMAN. JUST TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT SHE  TOUCHES. IT NEVER WORKS OUT. AND YOU WATCH. HER RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY WILL  NEVER, EVER WORK OUT. WE CAN'T LET IT WORK OUT.  HILLARY CLINTON THINKS BERNIE SANDERS'S SUPPORTERS ARE  HOPELESS AND IGNORANT BASEMENT DWELLERS. THEN OF COURSE SHE THINKS PEOPLE WHO VOTE FOR IN FOLLOW US ARE DEPLORABLE AND IRREDEEMABLE. I DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T THINK SO. WE HAVE THE SMARTEST PEOPLE. WE HAVE THE SHARPEST PEOPLE. WE HAVE THE MOST AMAZING PEOPLE. AND YOU KNOW IN ALL OF THE YEARS  OF THIS COUNTRY THEY SAY EVEN THE PUNDITS, MOST OF THEM ARE NOT WORTH THE GROUND THEY ARE STANDING ON -- SOME OF IT COULD  BE WEALTHY GROUND, THAT MOST OF THESE PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE NEVER  SEEN A PHENOMENON LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON. WE HAVE CROWDS LIKE THIS  WHEREVER WE GO. WE HAVE THESE MASSIVE CROWDS.  SOME CALL IT THE GREATEST PHENOMENON THEY'VE EVER SEEN  POLITICALLY IN THEIR LIVES. I THINK THAT IS WHAT IT IS.  REMEMBER THIS. ONE SAID TO ME LONG AGO, IT  DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU WIN OR  LOSE. WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS AMAZING. I SAID FORGET IT.  IF WE DON'T WIN ON NOVEMBER 8,  FIRST OF ALL I HAVE TENS AND TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. NOBODY ELSE DOES. I PUT MY OWN MONEY INTO THIS. WE HAVE SMALL SUPPORTERS AND A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT JUST WANT TO HELP THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.  BUT I HAVE PUT SELF FUNDING IN  TO A LEVEL TO HAVE NOT SEEN MAYBE EVER OR MANY YEARS. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. THE MONEY IS THE LEAST OF IT. I PUT A LOT OF ENERGY -- WE PUT  A LOT OF HEART AND SOUL, ALL OF  US. SOME OF YOU PEOPLE GET HERE AT  12:00 IN THE AFTERNOON FOR THIS AND EARLIER.  I KNOW, I KNOW. I KNOW. IT IS THE GOOD NEWS. WHEN YOU LEAVE, IS IT WORTH IT?  IF WE DON'T WIN ON NOVEMBER 8, I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY WRITE. I DON'T CARE IF THEY HAVE TO  GIVE US A LOT OF CREDIT.  I THINK THEY HAVE TO GIVE US  CREDIT. I WILL CONSIDER IT A TREMENDOUS  WASTE OF TIME, ENERGY AND MONEY.  BELIEVE ME. IF WE DON'T GET THERE, WE ARE  NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THE JOB.  WE ARE GOING TO BE DOING  SOMETHING FOR THIS COUNTRY THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS NEEDED FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. WE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING SO SPECTACULAR -- YOU WILL BE SO  PROUD OF YOUR COUNTRY ONCE AGAIN AND YOU ARE NOT PROUD OF YOUR  COUNTRY NOW.  YOU ARE CERTAINLY NOT PROUD OF  YOUR LEADER. HOW ABOUT LAST WEEK? ARE YOU PROUD OF YOUR LEADER?  HOW ABOUT TWO WEEKS  AGO? $400 MILLION IN CASH GOING TO IRAN.  REMEMBER THE HOSTAGES.  THEN HE LIED ABOUT THAT. NO, IT WAS NOT FOR HOSTAGES. BUT THEY CANNOT LEAVE UNTIL THEY  GOT THE CASH.  IT TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG. NOW IT IS LOOKING LIKE IT IS -- GET THIS.  SEE THE CORNERS? YOU CANNOT FIT THEM IN HERE. $1.7 BILLION IN CASH THEY PAID  TO A TERRORIST NATION. THEY PAID TO IRAN. $1.7 BILLION. HOW ABOUT LAST WEEK? THEY WERE GOING TO DEPORT 800  PEOPLE. THEY WERE READY FOR DEPORTATION,  WHICH MEANS THEY HAD PROBLEMS. BUT THEY MADE A MISTAKE AND  INSTEAD OF DEPORTING THESE 800 PEOPLE BACK TO THE MIDDLE EAST,  GUESS WHAT HAPPENED? THEY BECAME UNITED STATES  CITIZENS.   AND THAT TURNED OUT  TO BE WRONG, JUST LIKE THE $400 MILLION BECAME $1.7 BILLION. IT LOOKS LIKE THE 800 PEOPLE ARE 1700 PEOPLE AND WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME FOLKS. THEN I SAID, WELL, YOU MADE A MISTAKE. SO WHEN DO IT. THEY SAID -- SO UNDO IT. THEY SAID WE CAN'T DO THAT  BECAUSE IT WOULD BE  UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  THE WORLD LOOKS AT US LIKE WE  ARE STUPID PEOPLE. BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE STUPID PEOPLE MUCH LONGER, FOLKS. YOU HAVE GOT TO GO OUT. YOU HAVE GOT TO GO OUT AND YOU  HAVE GOT TO GET YOUR FRIENDS. YOU'VE GOT TO GET EVERYBODY YOU KNOW AND YOU HAVE GOT TO WATCH  HER POLLING BOOTHS. I HEAR TOO MANY STORIES ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA, CERTAIN AREAS. HIGH HERE TOO MANY BAD STORIES  AND WE CAN'T LOSE AN ELECTION  BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M  TALKING ABOUT. GO AND VOTE AND THEN GO CHECK OUT AREAS. A LOT OF BAD THINGS HAPPEN. WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE FOR THAT REASON. WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE, BUT WE ESPECIALLY DON'T WANT TO LOSE  FOR THAT REASON. GO OVER AND WATCH. AND WATCH CAREFULLY BECAUSE WE  ARE GOING TO WIN THE STATE OF  PENNSYLVANIA. IF WE WIN PENNSYLVANIA, WE TAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE.   WE ARE LEADING IN  OHIO. WE ARE LEADING IN NORTH  CAROLINA. I THINK WE ARE LEADING ALL OVER THE PLACE. WE ARE LEADING IN STATES THAT  NEVER REALLY PLAYED FOR REPUBLICANS, BUT WE ARE LEADING  ALL OVER. WE ARE DOING SO GREAT.  IF WE WIN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, WHERE I WENT TO  SCHOOL, WHERE MY KIDS WENT TO SCHOOL, IF WE WIN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, WE ARE GOING TO  HAVE A COUNTRY THAT YOU ARE  GOING TO BE SO PROUD OF. BELIEVE ME.  SO LET'S NOT FORGET THE OTHER  NIGHT. THE RECENT DEBATE, WHICH I THINK I WON TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.  EVEN THOUGH THEY GAVE ME A BUM  MIC. THEY CALL IT THE COMMISSION ON  THE DEBATES.  THE COMMISSION. THEY GET A GREAT JOB. I GO IN AND THE MICS ARE WORKING. WE HAVE THE COMMISSION ON  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES. BIG FANCY NAME, AND THEY GAVE ME  A BUM MIC. I HAVE TO SCREAM INTO THE  MIC. I HAVE FRIENDS IN THE AUDIENCE  GOING WHAT IS GOING ON?  HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM  THINK THAT MAYBE THAT WAS DONE  ON PURPOSE? YEAH. OK. AND THE HEADMAN, AFTER AN HOUR  AND A HALF AND IT'S OVER, AND I GOT GREAT -- I HAVE GREAT PRAISE.  ONE MINUTE LATER ALL OF THE DOPES THAT WORK AT CNN SAID TRUMP LOST AND START SCREAMING. I DON'T THINK HALF OF THEM WATCHED BECAUSE THEY WANT TO  CHANGE THE NARRATIVE. YOU WATCH THAT WITHOUT BEING INFLUENCED BY THESE PHONY PUNDITS -- DON'T FORGET, THEY  HAVE BEEN CALLING US WRONG FROM  THE BEGINNING. THEY HAVE BEEN CALLING US WRONG FROM JUNE 16.  WE HAD NO CHANCE.  WE WERE RUNNING AGAINST PROFESSIONALS. WE WERE RUNNING AGAINST SENATORS AND GOVERNORS, AND WE HAD NO  CHANCE. AND THEN ONE BY ONE, BUM, BUM. THESE TO WATCH THESE CHARACTERS  ON TELEVISION. DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT WON 25%. YOU HAVE 17 PEOPLE IN THE RACE. THEN THEY GO, TO WEEKS LATER, ANOTHER VICTORY, ANOTHER ONE. THEY SAY DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT WON 38%. AND WE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE LEFT  AND I HAD 49% OF THE VOTE WITH A  LOT OF PEOPLE. YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS? IT IS HARD TO GET TWO MANY -- TOO MANY VOTES. WE HAD 49% WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE RUNNING. WE HAD SENATORS AND GOVERNORS. TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE BEN CARSON WHO WERE GREAT PEOPLE AND  ENDORSED ME. SMART PEOPLE. GOOD PEOPLE. BEN CARSON, GREAT GUY. BUT THEY SAID -- I WILL NEVER  FORGET IT. 49% IN THE SAID TO ME RIGHT OVER THE TELEVISION, WHAT -- DONALD  TRUMP IS NOT HIT 50% YET. HOW THE HELL DO YOU HIT 50% WHEN  YOU HAVE 11 PEOPLE LEFT? BUT THEN WE LOST A COUPLE. VERY SAD TO WATCH. WE WERE ALL BROKEN UP. I GUARANTEE MOST OF THE PEOPLE  IN THIS ROOM WERE WITH US IN THE  BEGINNING.  WE WERE ALL BROKEN UP. REALLY.  AND THEN WE STARTED GETTING 52%, 58%, 66%, 78%, 82%. AND THEY JUST DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON. AND NOW THEY SAID WITH CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON, THAT IS ALL WE  HAVE LEFT IS CROOKED HILLARY. HERE IS A WOMAN THAT IS SUPPOSED TO FIGHT PUTIN --  HERE IS A WOMAN WHO  WAS SUPPOSED TO FIGHT TRADE  DEALS IN CHINA -- THEY ARE  RIPPING US LIKE NO ONE HAS RIPPED US IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.  HERE IS A WOMAN SUPPOSED TO BE FIGHTING PUTIN. HERE IS A WOMAN THAT IS GIVEN  BARACK OBAMA SUCH BAD ADVICE  THAT I GUARANTEE YOU IF HE HAD  THE CHOICE TO DO ALL OVER AGAIN,  GO BACK YEARS, HE WOULD OF NEVER  PICKED HER AS SECRETARY OF  STATE. SHE HAS BEEN A DISASTER. EVERYTHING SHE HAS DONE HAS BEEN  BAD. HUGE FINANCIAL LOSS AND DEATH,  AND I MEAN DEATH ON BOTH SIDES. YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON IN  THE MIDDLE EAST WHERE THEY  BOMBED THESE CITIES. YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW MANY PEOPLE  DIED. SHE HAS BEEN A DISASTER.  HERE IS A WOMAN -- SHE IS  SUPPOSED TO FIGHT ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS AND SHE CAN'T  MAKE IT 15 FEET TO HER CAR.  GIVE ME A BREAK.   GIVE ME A BREAK. SHE IS HOME RESTING RIGHT NOW.  SHE IS GETTING READY FOR HER NEXT BEACH WHICH OF THE IN 15  MINUTES AND TWO OR THREE DAYS.  WE NEED STAMINA. WE NEED ENERGY. WE NEED PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO  TURN DEALS AROUND. WE CAN'T LET CHINA TAKE  ADVANTAGE OF US ANYMORE.  WE HAVE THE PIGGY BANK.  WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE. BY THE WAY, DON'T WORRY.  THEY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT TEMPERAMENT. THAT IS A WORD THEY GOT FROM  MADISON AVENUE. HOW CAN WE ATTACK TRUMP? I HAVE A GREAT TEMPERAMENT.  I HAVE, IN MY OPINION -- IT'S  ONE OF MY STRONGEST THINGS.  I HAVE A WINNING TEMPERAMENT.  YOU KNOW HOW THEY -- OUR COUNTRY  DOES NOT WIN ANY MORE. SHE HAS BAD TEMPERAMENT. SHE COULD BE CRAZY. SHE COULD ACTUALLY BE CRAZY. DID YOU SEE THAT ALL THE NUMBERS  ARE GOING TO VOTE. THE TOP GUYS WILL BE WITH HER  BECAUSE THE TOP PEOPLE -- I WILL  TELL YOU ABOUT THAT SOMEDAY. HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE ARE IN THE AFL-CIO? NOT SO MANY.  WHERE ARE YOU? THE TOP PEOPLE ARE USUALLY  AGAINST US. THE UNIONS WILL BE WITH ME  BECAUSE I WILL PRODUCE JOBS. WE WILL BUILD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE  AND REBUILD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. SHE WOULD NOT KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN. I ONLY SAY THIS, LOOK, WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO IS STRONG. WE NEED SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS WHAT  THEY ARE DOING. WE WILL BRING THE GREATEST PEOPLE.  WE HAVE NOW -- IT WILL BE ANNOUNCED NEXT WEEK AN ADDITIONAL 200 PLUS ADMIRALS AND  GENERALS SUPPORTING US.  17 WINNERS OF THE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR, RECIPIENTS,  THESE GREAT RECIPIENTS OF THE  CONGRESSIONAL -- 17. ALMOST EVERY POLICE ORGANIZATION  IN THE COUNTRY. YOU TAKE A LOOK. LAW AND ORDER AND JUSTICE. LAW AND ORDER AND JUSTICE. THE BORDER PATROL. WE HAVE SO MANY THOUSANDS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. WITH THE UNIONS WE HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE UNDERNEATH THE BOSS THAT STOOD UP THERE WITH THEIR MILLION-DOLLAR SALARIES AND THEY WORK WITH THE DEMOCRATS, BUT THEY DON'T GET  ANYTHING.  WE HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE WITHIN THE UNIONS.  WE HAVE THE SUPPORT. YOU WATCH WHAT IS GOING TO  HAPPEN. AND WE HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE HISPANICS AND THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS BECAUSE THEY ARE TIRED OF BEING RIPPED OFF  AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. BELIEVE ME, YOU WATCH. THEY WILL HAVE SOME BIG,  BEAUTIFUL SURPRISES ON NOVEMBER  8. HILLARY CLINTON ALL THAT SAID THAT MOST OF THE COUNTRY IS RACIST, INCLUDING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. SHE SAID THAT THE OTHER NIGHT.  DID ANYBODY LIKE LESTER HOLT?  DID ANYBODY QUESTION HER WHEN  SHE SAID THAT? HE SAID IT THE OTHER NIGHT. YOU ARE NOT A DIEHARD CLINTON  FAN. YOU ARE NOT A SUPPORTER. FROM DAY ONE HILLARY CLINTON THANKS THAT YOU ARE A DEFECTIVE  PERSON. THAT IS WHAT SHE IS GOING AROUND  SAYING. HOW ON EARTH CAN HILLARY CLINTON  TRY TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY WHEN SHE HAS NOTHING BUT CONTEMPT FOR  THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE  COUNTRY?  SHE HAS CONTEMPT.  FIRST OF ALL SHE HAS BEEN IN SO  MANY SCANDALS. SHE HAS BEEN CAUGHT CHEATING SO  MUCH. ONE OF THE WORST THINGS I'VE EVER WITNESSED AS A CITIZEN OF  THE UNITED STATES WAS LAST WEEK  WHEN THE FBI DIRECTOR WAS TRYING  SO HARD TO EXPLAIN HOW SHE GOT  AWAY WITH WHAT SHE GOT AWAY  WITH. BECAUSE SHE SHOULD BE IN PRISON. LET ME TELL YOU.  SHE SHOULD BE IN PRISON. AND SHE IS BEING TOTALLY  PROTECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES  AND THE WASHINGTON POST AND ALL  OF THE MEDIA. AND CNN, CLINTON NEWS NETWORK  THAT NOBODY IS WATCHING  ANYWAY SO WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES  IT MAKE. SHE IS BEING PROTECTED BY MANY OF THESE GROUPS.  I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. IT IS NOT LIKE YOU THINK SHE IS GUILTY?  THEY HAVE ADMITTED SHE IS  GUILTY. AND THEN SHE LIVES IN LIES. 33,000 E-MAILS DELETED, BLEACHED, ACID WATCHED. THAT THEY TAKE THE PHONES AND  HAMMER THE HELL OUT OF THEM. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE ACID WATCHED -- WASHED A TWEET THAT YOU DELETED? BUT THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. THIS IS GETTING CRAZY. HOW COUNTRY IS BECOMING A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY. I WILL TELL YOU, YOU HAVE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. YOU HAVE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE IN  THE FBI. GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE. AND THEY ARE EMBARRASSED BY WHAT  IS GOING ON.  THEY ARE EMBARRASSED BY WHAT IS  GOING ON, BELIEVE ME. JUST LIKE YOU ARE EMBARRASSED AND I AM EMBARRASSED. HILLARY CLINTON SLANDERS AND ATTACKS ANYONE WHO WANTS TO PUT AMERICA FIRST.  WHETHER THEY ARE TRUMPED VOTERS  OR BERNIE VOTERS -- TRUMP  VOTERS OR BERNIE VOTERS. SHE WAS TO ERASE OUR BORDERS AND  DO IT FOR HER DONORS AND SHE  WANTS PEOPLE TO POUR INTO OUR  COUNTRY WITHOUT KNOWING WHO THEY ARE. YOU WANT TO SEE PROBLEMS?  YOU WATCH. THE SPECIAL INTERESTS PAY HER  FOR SPEECHES. THEY PAY HER FOUNDATION. THEY PAY HER HUSBAND. AND RETURN THEY GET YOUR JOBS.  THEY GET YOUR JOBS. YOU ARE STANDING HERE FROM  PENNSYLVANIA, STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS  HAPPENING. PEOPLE ARE NEGOTIATING AND  OWNERS OF COMPANIES ARE NEGOTIATING TO MOVE YOUR  COMPANIES TO MEXICO AND OTHER  PLACES.  IT IS GETTING WORSE. YOU ARE UNSUSPECTING. RIGHT NOW YOU SAY LET'S GO TO A  MOVIE AFTER TRUMP, BUT YOU WILL  DO THAT BECAUSE YOU WILL BE SO  EXCITED THAT NO MOVIE IS GOING  TO SATISFY YOU. YOU KNOW WHY? HONESTLY, BECAUSE THEY DON'T  MAKE MOVIES LIKE THEY USED TO.  IS THAT RIGHT? WHAT A DIFFERENCE. I HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL WEEK WHEN  IT COMES TO HILLARY CLINTON ALWAYS HAVE TO DO IS THESE THREE  WORDS. FOLLOW THE MONEY. ONE IN THREE COMPANIES THAT  LOBBIED FOR TPP PASSAGE DONATED  TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, AS  MUCH AS $67 MILLION. NINE COMPANIES THAT LOBBIED FOR  PASSAGE OF TPP GAVE HILLARY CLINTON $2.7 MILLION FOR SPEECHES. NOW SHE DOESN'T FOR FREE AND  VERY FEW PEOPLE SHOW UP. WHEN SHE WENT TO PENNSYLVANIA LAST WEEK, DID YOU SEE IT? IT WAS A SMALL ROOM AND THEY CANNOT FILL THE SEATS.  LOOK AT THIS PLACE. A MEDIA, TURN YOUR CAMERAS -- HEY MEDIA, TURN YOUR CAMERAS OVER THERE. THEY DON'T DO IT. THEY NEVER TURN THE CAMERAS. THE ONLY TIME THEY TURN THE CAMERAS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE  DISHONEST AS HELL. THEY DON'T REALIZE WHAT IS NEXT. IF THEY SHOWED -- ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE DOORWAY. PEOPLE OUTSIDE. IF THEY SHOWED THE KIND OF CROWDS WE HAVE, WHICH PEOPLE CAN HEAR. YOU CAN HEAR THE CROWDS. BUT IF THEY SHOWED, IT WOULD BE BETTER TELEVISION. BUT THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT  THAT. IT WOULD BE BETTER TELEVISION. THREE TPP MEMBER COUNTRIES GAVE BETWEEN $6 MILLION AND $15 MILLION TO CLINTON.  AT LEAST FOUR LOBBYISTS ACTIVELY LOBBYING FOR TPV PASSAGE HAVE  RAISED MORE THAN -- TPP PASSAGE  HAVE RAISED MORE THAN $800,000  FOR HER CAMPAIGN. I'M TELLING YOU PENNSYLVANIA WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT.  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT IF WE  HAVE PENNSYLVANIA, THAT IS FOR  SURE. THAT WOULD MAKE IT EASY. I'M JUST TELLING YOU, YOU CANNOT LET THIS PASS. NAFTA PASSED. IT IS IN THE WORST TRADE DEAL  PROBABLY EVER MADE. NOT IN THIS COUNTRY, ANYWHERE IN  THE WORLD. IT CLEANED OUT DOING WITH, BIG  PORTIONS OF -- A CLEANED OUT NEW ENGLAND, PENNSYLVANIA, OHIO, NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA. YOU CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN. THESE BLOODSUCKERS WANTED TO  HAPPEN. THEY ARE POLITICIANS GETTING  TAKEN CARE OF BY PEOPLE THAT  WANT IT TO HAPPEN. OTHER COUNTRIES WANT IT TO HAPPEN BECAUSE IT IS GOOD FOR  THEM BUT NOT GOOD FOR US. SO HOPEFULLY YOU ARE NOT GOING  TO LET IT HAPPEN. WHATEVER HILLARY'S OWNERS WANT,  THEY GET.  THEY OWN HER. ON NOVEMBER 8 WE ARE GOING TO AND CLINTON CORRUPTION -- END  CLINTON CORRUPTION.  HILLARY CLINTON, DISHONEST PERSON, IS AN INSIDER FIGHTING  FOR HERSELF AND FOR HER FRIENDS.  I AM AN OUTSIDER FIGHTING FOR  YOU.  BY THE WAY, JUST IN CASE YOU ARE NOT AWARE, I USED TO BE AN INSIDER BUT I THOUGHT THIS WAS  THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO,  BELIEVE ME.  FOR DECADES WE TALKED ABOUT THE CORRUPTION IN CONFIDENCE AND  FAILURES OF OUR LEADERS. 2016, OUR LONG-AWAITED CHANCE.  IT WILL BE OUR LONG-AWAITED CHANCE TO BRING ABOUT REAL  CHANGE. NOT OBAMA CHANGE, THE REAL  CHANGE.  REMEMBER THIS. HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE FOUR MORE YEARS OF BARACK OBAMA.  AND MAY BE WORSE. IT ACTUALLY MAY BE WORSE. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. WE WILL NOT HAVE A COUNTRY LEFT. IF YOU DO THIS ONE SIMPLE THING,  YOU CAN DELIVER JUSTICE FOR  EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO HAS BEEN  WRONGED BY THE SYSTEM. YOU HAVE TO SHOW UP AND VOTE. WHEN YOU CAST THAT BALLOT JUST  PICTURE A WALL STREET BOARD ROOM FILLED WITH SPECIAL INTERESTS  WHO HAVE BEEN BLEEDING OUT COUNTRY, WHO HAVE BEEN BLEEDING PENNSYLVANIA, WHO HAVE BEEN  TAKING YOUR JOBS. TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR FACES AND  YOU WILL SEE SMART PEOPLE THAT  KNOW THE GAME. BUT PEOPLE THAT WANT TO TAKE YOUR JOBS AND WANT TO TAKE YOUR MONEY. TO THEM, I SAY YOU ARE FIRED.   I COULD BE DOING ""THE APPRENTICE"" RIGHT NOW. I LOVED IT, 14 SEASONS. TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. THEY WANTED TO EXTEND. I COULD BE DOING ""THE APPRENTICE."" SOMEHOW I THINK THIS IS A LITTLE  MORE IMPORTANT. AND TO THE MILLIONS OF UNEMPLOYED AMERICANS, WE ARE  GOING TO SAY THE TWO WORDS THAT  I REALLY LOVE. YOU KNOW THEY ARE? YOU ARE HIRED. I AM NOT A POLITICIAN. I HAVE NO SPECIAL INTERESTS. MY ONLY LOYALTY -- AND I MEAN THIS. THIS IS TOUGH WORK. THIS IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A LOT  OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. FOR 17, 18, 20 YEARS YOU HAD A  BETTER JOB 20 YEARS AGO AND YOU HAD RIGHT NOW.  YOU GOT MORE MONEY. NOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF YEARS. YOU GET LESS MONEY.  IN MANY CASES YOU ARE WORKING  TWO JOBS, THREE JOBS. YOU ARE WORKING HARDER. YOU ARE OLDER. YOU ARE MAKING LESS MONEY. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE OTHER  WAY AROUND. THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY TO YOU IS I AM ALSO WORKING HARDER. THIS IS HARD WORK, BELIEVE ME. THIS IS HARD WORK. WHEN THEY TOLD ME OUTSIDE, SIR,  YOUR HELICOPTER CANNOT LAND  TONIGHT. THE WEATHER IS TERRIBLE. I SAID HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE THERE? IS THAT OF THESE 15,000. I SAID ARE YOU CRAZY? LAND THAT HELICOPTER.  THERE IS NO WAY WE WERE GOING TO  MISS IT.  THERE IS NO WAY WE ARE GOING TO  MISS IT AND THESE ARE AMAZING PEOPLE.  WE HAVE AMAZING PEOPLE IN OUR  COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR  COUNTRY TOGETHER EVERYWHERE.  HE WILL BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER.  MY ONLY LOYALTY IS TO YOU. I DON'T CARE ABOUT MY COMPANY AT  THAT POINT.  MY KIDS WILL RUN IT, BY  EXECUTIVES WILL RUN IT.  THIS IS A GREAT COMPANY. SOME OF THE GREATEST REAL ESTATE  ASSETS IN THE WORLD.  THEY SAY MAYBE YOU WILL HAVE A CONFLICT. IF I DO A GREAT JOB AS PRESIDENT, THEY WILL PROBABLY BE  MORE VALUABLE. THAT IS A CONFLICT, THAT IS A GOOD CONFLICT. ISN'T IT? WE NEED PROPER THINKING. OUR COUNTRY -- CAN YOU IMAGINE SOMEBODY SAYING $400 MILLION IN CASH OR $1.7 BILLION IN CASH, OR  800 PEOPLE AND NOW 1700 PEOPLE  FOR DEPORTATION. NOW COMING BACK AS CITIZENS. NOT LEGALLY, AS CITIZENS. HILLARY CLINTON'S ONLY LOYALTY  IS TO HER FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTORS  AND TO HERSELF. I DON'T EVEN THINK SHE IS LOYAL  TO BUILD YOU WANT TO KNOW THE  TRUTH. -- BILL IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE  TRUTH. AND REALLY, FOLKS, REALLY WHY  SHOULD SHE BE? WHY SHOULD SHE BE? THE LARGE CORPORATIONS WHO SUPPORT TERRIBLE TRADE DEALS  THAT SHIP YOUR JOBS TO OTHER COUNTRIES, THEY ARE DONATING TO  CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON. THE WALL STREET INVESTORS WHO HAVE RIGGED THE REGULATIONS AGAINST THE MIDDLE CLASS -- AND  BY THE WAY, WE HAVE  MIDDLE-CLASS. WE HAVE REALLY RICH PEOPLE HERE. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT SO  RICH. WE HAVE POOR PEOPLE. WE HAVE EVERYBODY HERE. WE HAVE HIGHLY EDUCATED PEOPLE. I KNOW TWO OF THEM. THEY ARE FRANKLY -- THEY ARE  HERE. THEY HAVE TOO MUCH EDUCATION.  THEY WOULD'VE DONE BETTER WITH A  LITTLE BIT LESS. ALWAYS ANGRY AT ME.  THAT IS OK. WE HAVE EVERYBODY, THAT WE HAVE  THE MOST LOYAL PEOPLE. EVERYBODY SAYS IT. WE HAVE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE  GOING TO GET OUT AND VOTE. WE HAVE THE PEOPLE THE MATTER  WHAT HAPPENS, THEY ARE OUT THERE  WITH US.  THEY KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING IS GOING TO BE SO GREAT FOR OUR  COUNTRY.  THE WEALTHY DONORS WHO WANT TO  SHUT DOWN AMERICAN ENERGY, AND  THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING, THEY ARE GIVING TO HILLARY  CLINTON. YOU SEE IT ALL THE TIME.  THE SPECIAL INTERESTS THAT WOULD OPEN BORDERS, THEY ARE DONATING  TO HILLARY CLINTON. FOLLOW THE MONEY. AND HER CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON HAS RECEIVED $100 MILLION IN CONTRIBUTIONS  FROM WALL STREET AND HEDGE  FUNDS. HE WAS A PERSON WHO IS ONLY WORKED IN THE GOVERNMENT  ESSENTIALLY. AND NOW THEY ARE WORTH $250 MILLION. IT'S NOT LIKE THEY BUILT A BIG  PROJECT OTHER PUT A LOT OF  PEOPLE TO WORK. THEY SAY SHE IS WORTH $200 MILLION, $250 MILLION.  GIVE ME A BREAK. HAVE YOU DO THAT? -- HOW DO YOU DO THAT? YOU KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENS. SHE AND BILL WERE PAID $150 MILLION FOR SPEECHES SINCE BILL LEFT THE OVAL OFFICE. THE SAME GROUPS PAYING BILL AND HILLARY -- I LOVE YOU TOO. THAT WAS A GUY, BUT I LOVE HIM. BILL AND HILLARY, FOR THEIR SPEECHES WERE LOBBYING THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE GETTING PAID TO LOBBY  THE GOVERNMENT. 22 GROUPS PAID BILL CLINTON FOR SPEECHES, LOBBIED THE STATE  DEPARTMENT WHILE HILLARY WAS  SECRETARY OF STATE. $250 MILLION. FAVORS AND ACCESS FOR GRANTED TO THOSE WHO WROTE CHECKS. SHE PUT THE SECRETARY OF STATE  OF FOR SALE. IF HE EVER GOT THE CHANCE, SHE  WOULD PUT THE OVAL OFFICE UP FOR SALE TOO. BELIEVE ME.  SHE DELETED AND BLEACHED 33,000 E-MAILS AFTER GETTING A  CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENA. HERE IS THE STORY, FOLKS. IF YOU'RE IN A PRIVATE DEAL AND  MR. SMITH IS SUING YOU, AND THEY  WANT YOUR RECORDS IN YOUR  E-MAILS AND EVERYTHING AND YOU SAY I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM,  BUT YOU HAVE A COURT ORDER --  THIS IS A COURT ORDER. YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM. IF YOU DON'T GIVE THEM, IF YOU  GET RID OF THEM, MEANING DELETE THEM, THEY PUT YOU IN JAIL. THEY PUT YOU IN JAIL. RIGHT? >> LOCK HER UP, LOCK HER UP.  SHE GOT A CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENA. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I TALK ABOUT IT. THE FBI DOES NOT DO ANYTHING. IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOES  NOT DO ANYTHING. THEN CLINTON, BILL, ME TO THE  ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HER PLANE. HE SAID THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT  GOLF AND THEIR GRANDCHILDREN. 39 MINUTES. I GIVE TWO MINUTES AND TWO OR  THREE MINUTES TO THE  GRANDCHILDREN. HE WAS SUPPOSEDLY AN ARIZONA  PLAYING GOLF, BUT I THINK IT WAS 114 DEGREES THAT DAY. IS VERY HOT. I LOVE ARIZONA, ONE OF MY  FAVORITE PLACES, BUT IT IS VERY  HARD TO PLAY THE TEMPERATURE  GOES OVER 100 DEGREES.  HE WAS THERE TO PLAY GOLF AND NOBODY PLAYED GOLF. DID ANYBODY SEE HIM PLAYING  GOLF? HE JUST HAPPENED TO BE STANDING  ON THE RUNWAY WHEN THIS PLANE  CAME BY. OH, HI. I HAVE HAD A PLANE FOR LONG TIME  AND NOBODY HAS EVER DONE THAT IN  YEARS.  DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY. WE ARE IN A RIGGED SYSTEM. AND WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IS  HORRIBLE. I WILL TELL YOU, AND I'VE SAID IT BEFORE, THIS IS ALL A GREAT  EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR GREAT  COUNTRY.  IT IS A GREAT EMBARRASSMENT. PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE 5% OF WHAT SHE DID ARE SUFFERING GRAVE  CONSEQUENCES. YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING TO  THEM. THE MOTHER CRYING BECAUSE OF THE  WAY THEY ARE TREATING HER BOY  WHO DID NOTHING BY COMPARISON. AND DID NOT MEAN TO DO IT.  YOU SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. GENERAL TRIAS -- PATREUS, DESTROYED HIS LIFE. AND IT WAS A TINY, TINY PIECE  COMPARED TO WHAT SHE HAS DONE.  THEN SHE HAS TAKEN 13 PHONES AND  THEY ARE MISSING, AND THEY WERE  DESTROYED. SOME OF THEM WITH A HAMMER. FOREIGN ENEMIES WITH EASY ACCESS WERE ABLE -- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY DID -- HACKER SERVER. HOW ABOUT THE SERVER PUT IN THE BASEMENT? LIES TO CONGRESS UNDER OATH ABOUT TURNING OVER HER  WORK-RELATED E-MAILS. HER STAFFERS TAKING THE FIFTH AMENDMENT, AND THE RINGLEADER'S  GETTING IMMUNITY DEALS. NOBODY LEFT BUT HER. SHE HAS NOT GOTTEN IMMUNITY YET. I WONDER IF OBAMA WILL GIVE HER  COMMUNITY. INTERESTING. SHE HAS NOT GOTTEN IMMUNITY YET. SHE IS THE ONLY ONE. DID ANYBODY EVER SEE SO MANY  PEOPLE GET IMMUNITY? EVERYBODY. YOU ARE GUILTY, YOU ARE GUILTY. WE WILL GIVE EVERYBODY COMMUNITY. LIKE ANY TO INVESTIGATE IF  EVERYBODY IS GETTING IMMUNITY?  SHE HAS NOT GOTTEN IT YET. WHAT ARE HER CHANCES OF GETTING IMMUNITY FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA? IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING. IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING. CLINTON AND HER CRONIES WILL SAY  ANYTHING, DO ANYTHING, LIE ABOUT ANYTHING TO ENRICH THEMSELVES  AND KEEP THEIR GRIP ON POWER. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE HAD IT  WITH YEARS AND DECADES OF CLINTON CORRUPTION AND SCANDALS.  REMEMBER HE GOT IMPEACHED FOR LYING. YOU WERE MEMBER WHAT HE LIED ABOUT. WHAT HE GOT IMPEACHED FOR LYING  ABOUT. HE CAN'T PRACTICE LAW, CAN'T BE A LAWYER. EVERYONE FORGETS. WE WANT TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK, FOLKS. WE WANT TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK.  LOOK AT WHITEWATER. LOOK AT THE CATTLE DEAL SHE  MADE. A FRIEND OF MINE IS IN THE CATTLE BUSINESS. THEY SAID THE SINGLE GREATEST DEAL PERCENTAGEWISE. SHE MADE A PERCENTAGE GAIN, I THINK IT HAVE TO BE SOME KIND OF  RECORD IN THE HISTORY OF THE CATTLE BUSINESS.  I GUESS SHE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT  CATTLE. IS A VERY SERIOUS THING. WE HAVE A VERY, VERY SERIOUS THING HAPPENING RIGHT NOW TO OUR COUNTRY. I WILL TELL YOU WHO IS LEADING IT, THESE PEOPLE BACK HERE. ALL OF THOSE CAMERAS ARE LEADING  IT. THEY ARE LETTING HER GET AWAY  WITH MURDER. THEY ARE PROTECTING HER.   WE ARE TIRED OF THE LIES, TIRED OF THE TRIVIAL POLITICS, TIRED OF BEING TALKED  DOWN TO, LOOK OUT UPON, AND  TREATED LIKE SECOND-CLASS  CITIZENS. IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE. THIS WILL BE THE YEAR THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN A TOTAL DISASTER FOR SO MANY COMMUNITIES, BUT ESPECIALLY FOR  THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. I DON'T THINK AFRICAN-AMERICANS  ARE GOING TO COME OUT AND VOTE  FOR CLINTON. THEY ARE TOO SMART AND THEY KNOW THEY HAVE BEEN USED FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS.  THEY ALSO KNOW HE WILL DO  NOTHING FOR THEM ONCE THE  ELECTION IS OVER.  SHE NEVER DOES, AND THAT'S NEVER  GOING TO CHANGE. MANY OF THEM WILL NEVER FORGET HER CALLING YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN SUPER PREDATORS.  THAT IS WHAT SHE CALLED THEM. TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN  COMMUNITY LET ME ASK YOU THIS ONE QUESTION, ARE YOU BETTER OFF THAN YOU WERE EIGHT YEARS AGO? LOOK FOR INSTANCE AT OUR INNER  CITIES. LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON.  LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON. MASSIVE LEVELS OF POVERTY, CRIME  OUT OF CONTROL, NO EDUCATION, NO JOBS, TREMENDOUS JOBLESSNESS. PEOPLE WALK TO THE OFFICE, THEY WALK TO GET A LOAF OF BREAD AND THEY GET SHOT. THEIR CHILD GETS SHOT. IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES AND DECADES.  HILLARY CLINTON AND PEOPLE THAT  THINK LIKE HER -- AND I SAY THIS  TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY, VOTE FOR DONALD  TRUMP. WHAT THE HELL THE YOU HAVE TO  LOSE? I WILL FIX IT.  I WILL FIX IT. I WILL BRING JOBS, GREAT EDUCATION, SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS. GIVE YOU KEEP VOTING FOR THE SAME PEOPLE, YOU WILL KEEP  GETTING THE SAME HORRIBLE RESULTS. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON  IN THE STREETS. TAKE A LOOK AT CHARLOTTE. TAKE A LOOK AT BALTIMORE. TAKE A LOOK AT FERGUSON. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING OUT ON THE STREETS OF OUR INNER CITIES. LOOK AT CHICAGO. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF  SHOOTINGS. 3000 SHOOTINGS SINCE JANUARY 1. NOT A LONG TIME AGO. IT IS WORSE THAN WAR ZONES. IN MANY CASES YOU HAVE CITIES, AND ARE CITIES, THAT ARE WORSE -- AND ARE CITIES THAT ARE WORSE  THAN WAR ZONES. A TRUMPET ADMINISTRATION WILL BRING PROSPERITY TO ALL OF OUR PEOPLE. BY ECONOMIC AGENDA CAN BE SUMMED UP IN THREE SUCH BEAUTIFUL WORDS. JOBS, JOBS, JOBS.  WE ARE GOING TO MASSIVELY REDUCE  TAXES FOR WORKING AND  MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS. EVERY WASTEFUL AND UNNECESSARY REGULATION WILL BE IMMEDIATELY ELIMINATED. WE WILL CREATE JOBS. THE TOTAL CATASTROPHE KNOWN AS  OBAMACARE WILL BE REPEALED AND  REPLACED.  WE WILL LIFT THE RESTRICTIONS ON AMERICAN ENERGY, INCLUDING CLEANING COAL AND SHALE ENERGY HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR MINERS,  WHICH HILLARY CLINTON SAID SHE  WANTS TO PUT OUR MINES AND MINERS OUT OF BUSINESS. SHE WAS TO PUT OUR MINES AND MINERS OUT OF BUSINESS. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN FOLKS. SHE ALSO WANTS TO SHUT DOWN PRODUCTION OF SHALE ENERGY.  NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. WE ARE GOING TO PUT THE MINERS  BACK TO WORK. WE WILL UNLEASH THE POWER OF SHALE ENERGY, ADDING ANOTHER $50 BILLION TO PENNSYLVANIA'S ECONOMY.  WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT THE OVER  5000 FARMS IN LANCASTER, WHICH I  KNOW VERY WELL. I WAS HERE SO MUCH. AND BY PROTECTION, THAT INCLUDES LOWER TAXES, LESS REGULATION, BETTER TRADE DEALS, AND MORE  AFFORDABLE ENERGY. HOW MANY BOMBERS TO BE HAPPIER  IN LANCASTER? A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED BY  THOSE FARMS. THOSE FARMERS, ARE THE RICH  PEOPLE? HE SAYS NOT SO GOOD. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A GOOD FOR  EVERYBODY. LET ME PAUSE BRIEFLY TO DISCUSS A VERY HEARTBREAKING TOPIC. AS MOST OF YOU KNOW, TOMORROW IS  THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE  SCHOOL SHOOTING. TONIGHT WHEN YOU SAY YOUR PRAYERS I ASK YOU TO REMEMBER  THOSE FIVE YOUNG BEAUTIFUL GIRLS  AND THEIR FAMILIES.  AND OTHER ISSUE WE ARE GOING TO  DEAL WITH IS IN CERTAIN WAYS SO IMPORTANT, THAT WHEN I TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT I JUST DID, THAT AS A  SPECIAL GROUP OF PEOPLE. SAY YOUR PRAYERS, PLEASE. REMEMBER THOSE PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH. REMEMBER THOSE FAMILIES.  REMEMBER THOSE FAMILIES. WE ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH TRADE. WE WILL TILT WITH THE DISASTROUS TRADE DEALS LIKE NAFTA THAT HAVE CROSSED INDUSTRY IN  PENNSYLVANIA. WE WILL RENEGOTIATE THEM TO MAKE  THEM GREAT DEALS OR TERMINATE  THEM AND START ALL OVER. WE WILL COME OUT SO FAR AHEAD. WE LOST SO MUCH MONEY, SO MANY  JOBS. YOUR STATE HAS LOST MORE THAN  ONE IN THREE MANUFACTURING JOBS  SINCE NAFTA WAS ENACTED. A BILL CLINTON ASSIGNED DEAL SUPPORTED -- CLINTON-SIGNED DEAL  SUPPORTED BY HILLARY. JOBS ARE MOVING TO MEXICO,  INCLUDING 300 THE LEFT IN RECENT  YEARS AND THE HERSHEY PLANT.  YOU HAVE LOST ONE IN FOUR MANUFACTURING JOBS SINCE CHINA ENTERED THE WTO. ANOTHER DEAL PUSHED BY BILL AN  SUPPORTED BY HILLARY. HILLARY CLINTON IS MERELY A  VESSEL FOR THIS GLOBAL SPECIAL INTERESTS TRYING TO STRIP OUR  COUNTRY OF HIS WEALTH, IT'S  JOBS, IT'S STATUS AS A SOVEREIGN NATION. WE DON'T MAKE ANYTHING ANYMORE. WE DON'T MAKE ANYTHING. WE ARE GOING TO START MAKING  THINGS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THE  COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA DEVALUE THEIR CURRENCY AND HAVE TRADE DEFICITS OF $400 BILLION AND 500  DOLLARS A YEAR. WE WILL NOT LET THAT HAPPEN --  500 ALIEN DOLLARS A YEAR. SHE IS A GLOBALIST THAT TAKES  JOBS IN OUR COUNTRY AND GIVES  THEM THE FOREIGN COUNTRIES. SHE WILL NOT TELL YOU THAT BUT  THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.  I AM NOT RUNNING TO THE  PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD. I AM RUNNING TO BE PRESIDENT OF  THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND  REPRESENT YOU.  HAVE EVER WONDERED WHY IT IS ALL THINGS CEMENTING PEOPLE WANT NEVER SEEM TO HAPPEN? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE HAD A  VICTORY? A MASSIVE COMPANY COMING INTO  TOWN? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME? YOU DON'T HAVE VICTORIES. WE CAN'T BEAT ISIS.  BY THE WAY, BY THE WAY, JUST THAT YOU KNOW OUR MILITARY IS  DEPLETED. WE GOING TO BUILD UP OUR  MILITARY. WE ARE GOING TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS.  IT IS BECAUSE THE FINANCIAL INTERESTS THAT CONTROL POLITICS AND MEDIA DON'T WANT THESE  CHANGES TO HAPPEN. I AM AN AGENT OF CHANGE. WE WILL MAKE GREAT CHANGE FOR  OUR COUNTRY.  HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN THERE  FOR 30 YEARS. WHEN I WAS UP ON THE STAGE ON MONDAY NIGHT I WAS SAYING TO MYSELF, IT WAS SORT OF STRANGE,  LIKE 100 MILLION PEOPLE. I HAD A BAD MIC. ALL OF A SUDDEN IT COMES TO ME  LIKE A MOMENT OF CLARITY.  MORE THAN ANY OTHER TIME SHE SAYS, I'M GOING TO DO THIS, I  WILL DO THAT, SHE HAS BEEN HERE  FOR 30 YEARS. WHY HASN'T HE DONE IT?  HE WILL NOT DO ANYTHING.  SHE HAS NEVER DONE ANYTHING MEANINGFUL. NEVER. HER ONLY LEGACY IS DEATH,  TREMENDOUS FINANCIAL LOSS AND  FAILURE. FOR POLICIES GAVE US THE DISASTROU -- DISASTERS IN IRAQ,  LIBYA AND SYRIA. HER POLICIES UNLEASHED ISIS. REMEMBER, THE WAY SHE GOT OUT OF  IRAQ LEFT A TREMENDOUS VACUUM  FROM WHICH ISIS WAS FORMED. I SAID THAT IN THIS CHARACTER,  STUDY THAT TAPE, HE CAME AT ME EVERY TIME. I WAS RIGHT. WITH HER WHEN SHE SAID THINGS THAT WERE WRONG, HE DID NOT COME  AFTER HER.  NOW SHE WANTS A 550% INCREASE IN SYRIAN REFUGEES BROUGHT TO OUR  COUNTRY. AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN SAY THE WORDS RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. NOR DOES PRESIDENT OBAMA. HER POLICIES GAVE US THE  DISASTROUS DEAL WITH IRAN, ONE  OF THE DUMBEST DEALS I'VE EVER  SEEN OF ANY KIND. AT HOME, LOOK AT HOW SHE FAILED. UPSTATE NEW YORK. SHE PROMISED -- SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT JOBS. I HAVE CREATED THOUSANDS AND  THOUSANDS OF JOBS. THAT IS WHAT I DO. I 38 JOBS. SHE PROMISED 200,000 JOBS. INSTEAD MORE PEOPLE LEFT AND SHE FAILED, A TREMENDOUS FAILURE. MANUFACTURING JOBS IN UPSTATE NEW YORK ARE DOWN TO THE 40%  FROM THE TIME SHE WAS ELECTED. HILLARY CLINTON IS THERE FOR  ONLY ONE REASON, TO PROTECT SPECIAL INTERESTS AND THOSE  DONORS AND HER OWN MONEY. OUR CAMPAIGN IS TAKING ON BIG BUSINESS, BIG MEDIA AND BIG DONORS.  WE KNOW HOW TO DO IT. YOU DO IT WITH MASSIVE RALLIES  LIKE THIS. THEY CAN'T COMPETE WITH US.  THEY CAN'T. MY CAMPAIGN IS POWERED BY MY MONEY, MY MONEY. AND BUY SMALL DOLLAR DONATIONS FROM HARD-WORKING PATRIOTS LIKE  ALL OF YOU. EVERY DOLLAR BRINGS US CLOSER TO  TAKING OUR COUNTRY BACK. WE HAVE RAISED TREMENDOUS  AMOUNTS OF MONEY. THE DAY AFTER THE DEBATE, $18  MILLION CAME IN TO OUR COFFERS.  THINK OF IT. $18 MILLION. THAT WAS OUR ALL-TIME RECORD. I GUESS THEY THOUGHT I DID GOOD  AT THE DEBATE, BUT WE GOT  TREMENDOUS MONEY COMING IN. WE WERE RAISING TREMENDOUS MONEY IN $61 NUMBERS. BECAUSE OF ALL OF YOU AND ALL OF  OUR GREAT VOLUNTEERS ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA, SOME OF WHICH ARE HERE TONIGHT, STANDING RIGHT IN  THE FRONT ROW. WE HAVE NOT RUN OVER 100,000 DOORS IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA -- WE HAVE KNOCKED ON THE DOORS OF PENNSYLVANIA AND  THE PEOPLE LIKE US KNOCKING ON  THE DOORS. OVER 100,000 DOORS THEY HAD  KNOCKED ON. RAZOR HANDS, PEOPLE -- RAISE  YOUR HANDS, PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING WITH US.  UNBELIEVABLE. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A BIG  VICTORY. YOU HAVE 38 DAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION. 38 DAYS TO CHANGE THE FUTURE OF  OUR COUNTRY AND THE WORLD.  YOU HAVE 38 DAYS TO MAKE EVERY  DREAM YOU EVER DREAMED FOR YOUR  COUNTRY COME TRUE. DO NOT LET THIS OPPORTUNITY SLIP AWAY OR BE WASTED. YOU WILL NEVER, EVER HAVE THIS  CHANCE AGAIN.  NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN. IN FOUR YEARS YOU ARE NOT GOING  TO BE ABLE TO DO IT.  YOU HAVE ONE MAGNIFICENT CHANCE  TO DELIVER JUSTICE FOR EVERY FORGOTTEN MAN, WOMAN AND   THE ARROGANCE OF WASHINGTON DC  WILL SOON COME FACE TO FACE WITH  THE RIGHTEOUS VERDICT OF THE  AMERICAN VOTER.  WATCH.   IT HAPPENED IN EUROPE WITH BREXIT, AND IT WILL  CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. AND I PREDICTED BREXIT. EVERYONE SAID WHAT DOES TRUMP  KNOW? BUT I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT, THERE WAS A BAD FEELING. AND I PREDICTED BREXIT, AND  EVERYBODY SAID HE IS CRAZY. AFTER I TURNED OUT TO BE RIGHT,  NOBODY SAID I PREDICTED IT. ON NOVEMBER 8, WE'RE GOING TO  SHOW THE WHOLE WORLD THAT  AMERICA IS BACK, BIGGER AND BETTER AND STRONGER THAN EVER  BEFORE.   JUST TO FINISH UP,  HERE'S JUST A FEW OF THE GREAT  THINGS THAT WILL HAPPEN FOR YOUR  COUNTRY. YOU ARE GOING TO SEE YOUR TAXES SUBSTANTIALLY LOWERED.  SHE WANTS TO RAISE YOUR TAXES. TREMENDOUS TAX DECREASE.  WE ARE GOING TO ELIMINATE EVERY  UNNECESSARY REGULATION. SHE WANTS TO INCREASE REGULATIONS.  WE WANT TO REPEAL AND REPLACE  JOB KILLING  WE WANT TO MAKE CHILD  CARE MORE AFFORDABLE. MY DAUGHTER IVANKA IS SO STRONG,  AND SHE WILL BE HERE NEXT WEEK  TO SPEAK. WE ARE TO ADD COMMON CORE. WE ARE GOING TO EVERY LOW INCOME  CHILD IN AMERICA. AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN,  HISPANIC CHILDREN ARE GOING TO  GET GREAT EDUCATIONS. WE ARE GOING TO END ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.   WE ARE GOING TO HAVE  A STRONG BORDER. BY THE WAY, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO  COME INTO OUR COUNTRY, BUT THEY  ARE GOING TO COME INTO OUR  COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. -- COUNTRY LEGALLY. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS OUT OF OUR  COUNTRY. HILLARY WANTS TO LET THEM COME  POOR AGAIN, WE CANNOT DO THAT. WE'RE GOING TO SAVE THE SECOND AMENDMENT, WHICH IS UNDER SIEGE. ANOTHER ONE THAT ENDORSED ME IS THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION. THEY WILL BE HAPPY TO SEE THAT. THEY ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE, AND THEY LOVE THE COUNTRY. THESE ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE THAT TRULY LOVELY COUNTRY. BY THE WAY, IF YOUR SUPPORTERS OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT, YOU  HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE. SUPPORT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW  ENFORCEMENT. WE HAVE TO.   WE ARE GOING TO APPOINT JUSTICES TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WHO WILL  UPHOLD AND DEFEND THE  CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.   WE WILL REBUILD OUR ROADS, OUR BRIDGES, TUNNELS, HIGHWAYS, AIRPORTS, SCHOOLS, AND  HOSPITALS. AMERICAN CARS WILL TRAVEL THE ROADS.  AMERICAN PLANES WILL SOAR IN THE  SKIES. AMERICAN SHIPS THAT WE MAKE WILL  CONTROL THE SEAS. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL WILL BUILD THIS COUNTRY LIKE IT BUILT THE  EMPIRE STATE BUILDING MANY YEARS  AGO.   PENNSYLVANIA STEEL  AND THE INCREDIBLE STEELWORKERS WILL SEND NEW SKYSCRAPERS INTO THE CLOUDS. AMERICAN HANDS WILL REBUILD THIS NATION, AND AMERICAN ENERGY MIND BY OUR MINERS -- MINED BY OUR MINERS, INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. IT WILL POWER OUR NATION. AMERICAN WORKERS WILL BE HIRED  TO DO THE JOB, AND WE WILL START  MAKING THINGS AGAIN, AND WE WILL  START WINNING AGAIN. WE WILL KNEW PENNSYLVANIA STEEL  INTO THE SPINE OF THIS COUNTRY.  I WILL FIGHT FOR EVERY NEGLECTED  PART OF OUR NATION, AND I WILL  FIGHT TO BRING US ALL TOGETHER  AS AMERICANS. IMAGINE WHAT OUR COUNTRY COULD ACCOMPLISH IF WE STARTED WORKING TOGETHER AS ONE PEOPLE UNDER ONE GOD, SALUTING ONE AMERICAN FLAG.   ON NOVEMBER 8, A NEW  BRIGHT DAWN BEGINS FOR OUR  COUNTRY. PENNSYLVANIA, YOU HAVE NO IDEA  THE IMPORTANCE. CROOKED HILLARY IS SPENDING TENS  OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON WALL STREET MONEY, RUNNING  COMMERCIALS ABOUT ME THAT ARE FALSE -- MOSTLY FALSE, A LITTLE TRUTH ONCE IN A WHILE. SO MANY COMMERCIALS, A FRIEND OF  MINE CALLED UP AND SAID THERE IS  NOTHING ELSE BUT THOSE  COMMERCIALS.  THEY ARE DRIVING ME CRAZY. DONALD, IT IS NOT YOU. THAT IS TRUE, IT IS NOT ME. BUT SHE IS SPENDING TENS OF  MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, IT IS A DISGRACE. AND MUCH OF THOSE COMMERCIALS I  WILL TELL YOU ARE FALSE. WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT  I THINK THE COUNTRY HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE.  THIS MOVEMENT IS SPECIAL, THE  PEOPLE ARE SPECIAL. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA  WEALTHY AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA STRONGER AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA POWERFUL AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  THANK YOU EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. GOD BLESS YOU EVERYBODY, THANK  YOU. GET OUT AND VOTE. GOD BLESS YOU.    ","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Rally in Manheim, Pennsylvania"

OUR JOBS ARE FLEEING THE   COUNTRY. THEY'RE GOING TO MEXICO. THEY'RE GOING TO MANY OTHER   COUNTRIES. YOU LOOK AT WHAT CHINA IS DOING  TO OUR COUNTRY IN TERMS OF   MAKING OUR PRODUCT. THEY'RE DEVALUING THEIR   CURRENCY AND THERE'S NOBODY IN   OUR GOVERNMENT TO FIGHT THEM   AND WE HAVE A VERY GOOD FIGHT   AND WE HAVE A WINNING FIGHT, BECAUSE THEY'RE USING OUR   COUNTRY AS A PIGGYBANK TO   REBUILD CHINA, AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES ARE DOING THE SAME   THING. SO WE'RE LOSING OUR GOOD JOBS, SO MANY OF THEM.  WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S   HAPPENING IN MEXICO, A FRIEND   OF MINE WHO BUILDS PLANTS SAID   IT'S THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD. THEY'RE BUILDING SOME OF THE   BIGGEST PLANTS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, SOME OF THE MOST   SOPHISTICATED AND BEST PLANTS.  WITH THE UNITED STATES, AS YOU SAID, NOT SO MUCH.  SO FORD IS LEAVING. YOU SEE THAT THERE'S DIVISION, LEAVING.  THOUSANDS OF JOBS, LEAVING MICHIGAN, LEAVING OHIO.  THEY'RE ALL LEAVING AND WE   CAN'T ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN ANYMORE.  AS FAR AS CHILDCARE IS CONCERNED AND SO MANY OTHER   THINGS, I THINK HILLARY AND I   AGREE ON THAT.  WE PROBABLY DISAGREE A LITTLE   BIT AS TO NUMBERS AND AMOUNTS   AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO, BUT  PERHAPS WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT   THAT LATER. BUT WE HAVE TO STOP OUR JOBS   FROM BEING STOLEN FROM US.  WE HAVE TO STOP OUR COMPANIES FROM LEAVING THE UNITED STATES   AND WITH IT, FIRING ALL OF   THEIR PEOPLE. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT CARRIER AIR   CONDITIONING IN INDIANAPOLIS.  THEY FIRED 1400 PEOPLE.  THEY'RE GOING TO MEXICO.  SO MANY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS   OF COMPANIES ARE DOING THIS.  WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN.  UNDER MY PLAN, I WILL BE REDUCING TAXES TREMENDOUSLY   FROM 35% TO 15% FOR COMPANIES, SMALL AND BIG BUSINESSES.  THAT'S GOING TO BE A JOB   CREATOR LIKE WE HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE RONALD REAGAN. IT'S GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL THING TO WATCH. COMPANIES WILL COME.  THEY WILL BUILD. THEY WILL EXPAND.  NEW COMPANIES WILL START, AND I  LOOK VERY, VERY MUCH FORWARD TO DOING IT.  WE HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE OUR   TRADE DEALS AND WE HAVE TO STOP  THESE COUNTRIES FROM STEALING OUR COMPANIES AND OUR  WELL, FOR ONE   THING, AND BEFORE WE START ON THAT, MY FATHER GAVE ME A VERY SMALL LOAN IN 1975 AND I BUILT   IT INTO A COMPANY THAT'S WORTH   MANY, MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS   WITH SOME OF THE GREATEST   ASSETS IN THE WORLD, AND I SAY THAT ONLY BECAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF THINKING OUR COUNTRY NEEDS.  OUR COUNTRY IS IN DEEP TROUBLE.  WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING WHEN IT COMES TO DEVALUATIONS   AND ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES ALL   OVER THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY CHINA, THEY'RE THE BEST, THE   BEST EVER AT IT.  WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO US IS A VERY, VERY SAD THING.  SO WE HAVE TO DO THAT.  WE HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE OUR   TRADE DEALS.  AND LESTER, THEY ARE TAKING OUR JOBS.  THEY'RE GIVING INCENTIVES.  THEY'RE DOING THINGS THAT   FRANKLY WE DON'T DO.  LET ME GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE OF   MEXICO. THEY HAVE A VAT TAX.  WE'RE ON A DIFFERENT SYSTEM.  WHERE WE SELL INTO MEXICO IS A   TAX. WHERE THEY SELL AN AUTOMATIC   16% APPROXIMATELY. WHEN THEY SELL INTO US, THERE'S NO TAX. IT'S A DEFECTIVE AGREEMENT.  IT'S BEEN DEFECTIVE A LONG TIME, MANY YEARS, BUT THE   POLITICIANS HAVEN'T DONE   ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  NOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SECRETARY CLINTON, YES -- IS   THAT OKAY? GOOD.  I WANT YOU TO BE VERY HAPPY.   IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.  IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SECRETARY   CLINTON, WHEN SHE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THIS, IT WAS REALLY VERY RECENTLY, SHE'S   BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS, AND WHY HASN'T SHE MADE THE AGREEMENTS BETTER?   THE NAFTA AGREEMENT IS DEFECTIVE JUST BECAUSE OF THE   TAX AND MANY OTHER REASONS, BUT  SECRETARY CLINTON  AND OTHERS, AS POLITICIANS,   SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR  YEARS, NOT RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE   OF THE FACT THAT WE'VE CREATED   A MOVEMENT.  THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING   THIS FOR YEARS.  WHAT'S HAPPENED TO OUR JOBS AND  OUR COUNTRY AND OUR ECONOMY   GENERALLY IS, LOOK, WE OWE $20 TRILLION.  WE CANNOT DO IT ANY  THE FIRST THING   YOU DO IS DON'T LET THE JOBS   LEAVE. THE COMPANIES ARE LEAVING.  I COULD NAME -- THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THEM.  THEY'RE LEAVING.  AND THEY'RE LEAVING IN BIGGER   NUMBERS THAN EVER. AND WHAT YOU DO IS YOU SAY, FINE, YOU WANT TO GO TO MEXICO OR SOME OTHER COUNTRY, GOOD LUCK.  WE WISH YOU A LOT OF LUCK. BUT IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING   TO MAKE YOUR AIR CONDITIONERS OR YOUR CARS OR YOUR COOKIES OR WHATEVER YOU MAKE AND BRING THEM INTO OUR COUNTRY WITHOUT A  TAX, YOU'RE WRONG AND ONCE YOU   SAY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAX  THEM COMING IN -- AND OUR POLITICIANS NEVER DO THIS,   BECAUSE THEY HAVE SPECIAL INTERESTS AND THE SPECIAL   INTERESTS WANT THOSE COMPANIES TO LEAVE BECAUSE IN MANY CASES   THEY OWN THE COMPANIES. SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS WE CAN STOP THEM FROM LEAVING.  WE HAVE TO STOP THEM FROM LEAVING, AND THAT'S A BIG, BIG FACTOR.  THAT'S CALLED   BUSINESS, BY THE WAY.  I DID NOT, I DO   NOT SAY THAT.  SHE TALKS ABOUT   SOLAR PANELS.  WE INVESTED IN THE SOLAR   COMPANY, OUR COUNTRY, THAT WAS   A DISASTER ON THAT ONE. NOW, LOOK, I'M A GREAT BIG BELIEVER IN ALL FORMS OF ENERGY BUT WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF   PEOPLE OUT OF WORK. OUR ENERGY POLICIES ARE A DISASTER.  OUR COUNTRY IS LOSING SO MUCH   IN TERMS OF ENERGY, IN TERMS OF PAYING OFF OUR DEBT. YOU CAN'T DO WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO DO WITH 20 TRILLION IN DEBT. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, FROM   THE TIME THEY'VE COME IN, IS OVER 230 YEARS' WORTH OF DEBT AND HE'S TOPPED IT. HE'S DOUBLED IT IN THE COURSE   OF ALMOST EIGHT YEARS, 7.5   YEARS TO BE SEMIEXACT. SO I WILL TELL YOU THIS.  WE HAVE TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB  AT KEEPING OUR JOBS, AND WE   HAVE TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB AT  GIVING COMPANIES INCENTIVE TO   BUILD NEW COMPANIES OR TO   EXPAND, BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT   DOING IT. AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT MICHIGAN AND LOOK AT OHIO AND LOOK AT ALL OF THESE PLACES WHERE SO MANY OF THEIR JOBS AND  THEIR COMPANIES ARE JUST LEAVING THEIR  LEAVING, THEY'RE GONE.  AND HILLARY, I ASK YOU THIS,   YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 30 YEARS.  WHY ARE YOU JUST THINKING ABOUT  THESE SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW? FOR 30 YEARS YOU'VE BEEN DOING   IT AND NOW YOU'RE JUST STARTING  TO THINK ABOUT SOLUTIONS.  EXCUSE ME, I WILL BRING BACK   JOBS.  YOU   WELL, HE APPROVED NAFTA.  THE SINGLE WORST TRADE DEAL  BUT YOU HAVEN'T  YOU  YOUR HUSBAND SIGNED NAFTA WHICH WAS ONE OF   THE WORST THINGS THAT EVER   HAPPENED TO THE  THAT IS YOUR   OPINION. DONALD TRUMP: YOU GO TO NEW ENGLAND, OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, YOU GO ANYWHERE YOU WANT,   SECRETARY CLINTON, AND YOU WILL SEE DEVASTATION, WHERE   MANUFACTURING IS DOWN 30, 40,   SOMETIMES 50%.  NAFTA IS THE WORST TRADE DEAL MAYBE EVER SIGNED ANYWHERE BUT   CERTAINLY EVER SIGNED IN THIS   COUNTRY AND NOW YOU WANT TO   APPROVE TRANSPACIFIC   PARTNERSHIP. YOU WERE TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF   IT.  THEN YOU HEARD WHAT I WAS   SAYING, HOW BAD IT IS, AND YOU   SAID I CAN'T WIN THAT DEBATE.  BUT YOU KNOW THAT IF DID YOU   WIN, YOU WOULD APPROVE THAT,   AND THAT WOULD BE ALMOST AS BAD  AS NAFTA.  YOU CALLED IT THE  GOLD STANDARD.  YOU CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD OF TRADE DEALS.  YOU SAID IT'S THE FINEST DEAL   YOU'VE EVER SEEN.  SO IS IT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FAULT? IS IT PRESIDENT  IS IT PRESIDENT   OBAMA'S FAULT?   BECAUSE HE'S PUSHING IT.   OH, I DO.   DONALD TRUMP: SECRETARY, YOU   HAVE NO PLAN.  YOU ARE GOING TO   APPROVE ONE OF THE BIGGEST TAX   CUTS IN HISTORY.  YOU ARE GOING TO APPROVE ONE OF  THE BIGGEST TAX INCREASES IN   HISTORY. YOU ARE GOING TO DRIVE BUSINESS OUT.  YOUR REGULATIONS ARE A   DISASTER, AND YOU'RE GOING TO INCREASE REGULATIONS ALL OVER THE PLACE.  AND BY THE WAY, MY TAX CUT IS   THE BIGGEST SINCE RONALD REAGAN.  I'M VERY PROUD OF IT.  IT WILL CREATE TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF NEW JOBS. BUT REGULATIONS, YOU ARE GOING   TO REGULATE THESE BUSINESSES OUT OF EXISTENCE. WHEN I GO AROUND -- LESTER, I   TELL YOU THIS. I'VE BEEN ALL OVER. AND WHEN I GO AROUND, DESPITE THE TAX CUT, THE THINGS THAT BUSINESS THAT PEOPLE LIKE THE   MOST IS THE FACT THAT I'M   CUTTING REGULATION.  YOU HAVE REGULATIONS ON TOP OF REGULATIONS, AND NEW COMPANIES CANNOT FORM AND OLD COMPANIES ARE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS, AND   YOU WANT TO INCREASE THE REGULATIONS AND MAKE THEM EVEN WORSE.  I'M GOING TO CUT REGULATIONS. I'M GOING TO CUT TAXES, BIG-LEAGUE, AND YOU ARE GOING TO RAISE TAXES BIG-LEAGUE,  FACTS.  AND TAKE A LOOK AT MINE ALSO.  COULD I JUST FINISH?   IF YOU GO TO OUR WEB SITE.  TAKE A LOOK AT OUR WEB SITE.  SHE'S GOING TO RAISE TAXES 1.3   TRILLION DOLLARS.  AND LOOK AT HER WEB SITE.  YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S NO   DIFFERENT THAN THIS. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS.  GO TO HER WEB SITE. SHE'S TELLING US HOW TO FIGHT ISIS. I DON'T THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR  LEAST I   HAVE A PLAN TO FIGHT ISIS. DONALD TRUMP: NO, NO. YOU'RE TELLING THE ECONOMY EVERYTHING YOU'RE WANTING TO DO.  YOU'RE TELLING THE ECONOMY EVERYTHING YOU WANT  TO DO. NO WONDER YOU'VE BEEN FIGHTING ISIS YOUR ENTIRE ADULT  WELL, I'M REALLY CALLING FOR MAJOR JOBS BECAUSE   THE WEALTHY ARE GOING TO CREATE  TREMENDOUS JOBS. THEY'RE GOING TO EXPAND THEIR COMPANYS AND DO A TREMENDOUS JOB. I'M GETTING RID OF THE CARRIED   INTEREST PROVISION AND IF YOU   REALLY LOOK, IT'S REALLY NOT A GREAT THING FOR THE WEALTHY.  IT'S A GREAT THING FOR MIDDLE   CLASS AND IT'S A GREAT THING   FOR COMPANIES TO EXPAND AND   WHEN THESE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO PUT BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF  DOLLARS INTO COMPANIES AND WHEN  THEY'RE GOING TO BRING 2.5 TRILLION DOLLARS BACK FROM OVERSEAS, THEY CAN'T BRING THE   MONEY BACK BECAUSE POLITICIANS   LIKE SECRETARY CLINTON WON'T   ALLOW THEM TO BRING THE MONEY   BACK BECAUSE THE TAXES ARE SO OWNEROUS AND THE BUREAUCRAT RED  TAPE IS SO BAD, SO WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS LEAVING OUR COMPANY, AND THEY'RE BELIEVE IT OR NOT   LEAVING BECAUSE TAXES ARE TOO   HIGH AND BECAUSE SOME OF THEM HAVE LOTS OF MONEY OUTSIDE OF   OUR COUNTRY AND INSTEAD OF BRINGING IT BACK AND PUTTING THE MONEY TO WORK BECAUSE THEY   CAN'T WORK OUT A DEAL IT -- AND EVERYBODY AGREES IT SHOULD BE BROUGHT BACK, INSTEAD OF THAT, THEY'RE LEAVING OUR COUNTRY TO GET THEIR MONEY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BRING THEIR MONEY BACK INTO OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE OF BUREAUCRAT RED TAPE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET TOGETHER. BECAUSE WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT CAN'T SIT THEM AROUND A TABLE AND GET THEM TO APPROVE SOMETHING AND HERE'S THE THING, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AGREE THAT THIS SHOULD BE DONE. 2.5 TRILLION. I HAPPEN TO THINK IT'S DOUBLE THAT. IT'S PROBABLY $5 TRILLION THAT WE CAN'T BRING INTO OUR COUNTRY, LESTER AND WITH A   LITTLE LEADERSHIP, YOU'D GET IT  IN HERE VERY QUICKLY AND IT   COULD BE PUT TO USE ON THE   INNER CITIES AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS AND IT WOULD BE   BEAUTIFUL, BUT WE HAVE NO LEADERSHIP.  AND HONESTLY, THAT STARTS   THERE'S NOTHING   CRAZY ABOUT NOT LETTING OUR   COMPANIES BRING THEIR MONEY BACK INTO THIS COUNTRY.  WHO GIVE GAVE  HOW MUCH FOR MY FAMILY?  TYPICAL POLITICIAN, ALL TALK, NO ACTION, SOUNDS GOOD, DOESN'T   WORK, NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.  OUR COUNTRY IS SUFFERING BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE SECRETARY   CLINTON HAVE MADE SUCH BAD DECISIONS IN TERMS OF OUR JOBS AND IN TERMS OF WHAT'S GOING ON.  NOW, LOOK, WE HAVE THE WORST   REVIVAL OF AN ECONOMY SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, AND BELIEVE   ME, WE'RE IN A BUBBLE RIGHT NOW, AND THE ONLY THING THAT   LOOKS GOOD IS THE STOCK MARKET.  BUT IF YOU RAISE INTEREST RATES EVEN A LITTLE BIT, THAT'S GOING  TO COME CRASHING DOWN.  WE ARE IN A BIG, FAT UGLY BUBBLE, AND WE'D BETTER BE AWFULLY CAREFUL, AND WE HAVE A   FED THAT'S DOING POLITICAL THINGS. THIS JANET YELLEN OF THE FED, THIS FED IS DOING POLITICAL BY   KEEPING INTEREST RATES AT THIS   LEVEL AND BELIEVE ME, THE DAY OBAMA GOES OFF AND HE LEAVES   AND GOES OFF TO THE GOLF COURSE  THE REST OF HIS LIFE TO PLAY   GOLF, WHEN THEY RAISE INTEREST RATES, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME  VERY BAD THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE   THE FED IS NOT DOING THEIR JOB. THE FED IS BEING MORE POLITICAL  THAN SECRETARY CLINTON.  I DON'T MIND RELEASING.  I'M UNDER A ROUTINE AUDIT, AND   AS SOON AS THE AUDITS ARE   FINISHED IT WILL BE RELEASED. YOU WILL LEARN MORE ABOUT   DONALD TRUMP BY GOING DOWN TO   THE FEDERAL ELECTIONS WHERE I   FILED A 104-PAGE, ESSENTIALLY,   FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF SORTS,   THE FORMS THAT THEY HAVE. IT SHOWS INCOME -- IN FACT, THE  INCOME, I JUST LOOKED TODAY,   THE INCOME IS FILED AT $694 MILLION FOR THIS PAST YEAR.  $694 MILLION.  YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME I WAS   GOING TO MAKE THAT 15 OR 20   YEARS AGO, I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY SURPRISED.  BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF THINKING  THAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS.  WHEN WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT'S   DOING SO BADLY, THAT'S BEING   RIPPED OFF BY EVERY SINGLE   COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, IT'S THE   KIND OF THINKING THAT OUR   COUNTRY NEEDS, BECAUSE EVERYBODY -- LESTER, WE HAVE A   TRADE DEFICIT WITH ALL OF THE COUNTRIES THAT WE DO BUSINESS WITH OF ALMOST $800 BILLION A YEAR.  YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?   THAT MEANS WHO'S NEGOTIATING THESE TRADE DEALS?   WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE POLITICAL HACKS NEGOTIATING  I WILL RELEASE THEM AS SOON AS THE AUDIT -- I'VE BEEN UNDER AUDIT ALMOST 15 YEARS. I KNOW A LOT OF WEALTHY PEOPLE   THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN AUDITED.  I SAID, DO YOU GET AUDITED? I GET AUDITED ALMOST EVERY   YEAR.  IN A WAY, I SHOULD BE COMPLAINING.  I DON'T COMPLAIN, IN A WAY, -- A  LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T GET AUDITED.  I WILL SAY THIS.  WE HAVE A SITUATION IN THIS   COUNTRY THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF.  I WILL RELEASE MY TAX RETURNS   AGAINST MY LAWYERS' WISHES. WHEN SHE RELEASES HER 33,000 E-MAILS THAT HAVE BEEN DELETED,  AS SOON AS SHE RELEASES THEM, I  WILL RELEASE -- I WILL RELEASE   MY TAX RETURNS.  AND THAT'S AGAINST MY LAWYERS -- THEY SAY, DON'T DO   IT.  I WILL TELL YOU THIS -- NO, IN   FACT, WATCHING SHOWS AND   READING THE PAPERS, ALMOST   EVERY LAWYER SAYS, YOU DON'T   RELEASE YOUR RETURNS UNTIL THE   AUDIT IS COMPLETE.  WHEN THE AUDIT IS COMPLETE,   I'LL DO IT.  BUT I WOULD GO AGAINST THEM IF SHE RELEASES HER  SO IT'S   NEGOTIABLE? DONALD TRUMP: IT'S NOT   NEGOTIABLE, NO.  LET HER RELEASE THE E-MAILS.  WHY DID SHE DELETE  THAT MAKES ME  THAT'S FOR SURE.  THAT WAS MORE   THAN A MISTAKE.  THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY.  OKAY, THAT WAS NOT A MISTAKE.  THAT WAS DONE PURPOSELY. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR STAFF TAKING  THE FIFTH AMENDMENT -- TAKING   THE FIFTH SO THEY'RE NOT PROSECUTED, WHEN YOU HAVE THE   MAN THAT SET UP THE ILLEGAL SERVER TAKING THE FIFTH, I   THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL.  AND BELIEVE ME, THIS COUNTRY   THINKS IT'S DISGRACE -- REALLY   THINKS IT'S DISGRACEFUL ALSO.  AS FAR AS MY TAX RETURNS, YOU DON'T LEARN THAT MUCH FROM TAX RETURNS. THAT I CAN TELL YOU.  YOU LEARN A LOT FROM FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE, AND YOU SHOULD GO DOWN AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. THE OTHER THING, I'M EXTREMELY UNDER-LEVERAGED.  THE REPORT THAT SAID   650 -- WHICH BY THE WAY, A LOT   OF FRIENDS OF MINE THAT KNOW MY BUSINESS SAID BOY, THAT'S   REALLY NOT A LOT OF MONEY. THAT'S REALLY NOT A LOT OF   MONEY RELATIVE TO WHAT I HAVE.  THE BUILDINGS IN QUESTION, THEY  SAID IN THE SAME   REPORT -- ACTUALLY, IT WASN'T EVEN A BAD STORY TO BE HONEST   WITH YOU BUT THE BUILDINGS ARE   WORTH $3.9 BILLION AND THE 650 ISN'T EVEN OF THAT.  BUT IT'S NOT 650. IT'S MUCH LESS THAN THAT. BUT I COULD GIVE YOU A LIST OF   BANKS, IF THAT WOULD HELP YOU, I WOULD GIVE YOU A LIST OF BANKS, VERY FINE INSTITUTIONS AND FINE BANKS I COULD DO THAT QUICKLY.  I AM UNDER LEVERAGED, I HAVE A GREAT COMPANY AND HAVE A TREMENDOUS INCOME.  I'M NOT SAYING THAT IN A BRAGODOCIOUS WAY.  IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEBODY   RUNNING THIS COUNTRY HAS AN   IDEA ABOUT MONEY.  WHEN WE HAVE $20 TRILLION IN   DEBT AND OUR COUNTRY IS IN   DEBT -- IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE   $20 TRILLION IN DEBT AND OUR   ROADS AND BRIDGES ARE GOOD, AND  EVERYTHING IS IN GREAT SHAPE,   OUR AIRPORTS ARE LIKE FROM A THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY.  YOU LAND AT LAGUARDIA, YOU LAND  AT KENNEDY, LAX, NEW A, AND YOU  COME IN FROM DUBAI , CHINA, YOU  SEE THESE INCREDIBLE AIRPORTS   AND YOU LAND, WE'VE BECOME A   THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY.  SO THE WORST OF ALL THINGS HAS   HAPPENED. WE OWE $20 TRILLION AND WE'RE A MASS.  WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED.  WE'VE SPENT $6 TRILLION IN THE MIDDLE EAST ACCORDING TO A REPORT THAT I JUST SAW, WHETHER IT'S 6 OR 5, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S 6.  $6 TRILLION. IN THE MIDDLE EAST WE COULD HAVE REBUILT OUR COUNTRY TWICE, AND IT'S REALLY A SHAME. IT'S POLITICIANS LIKE SECRETARY  CLINTON THAT HAVE CAUSED THIS PROBLEM.  OUR COUNTRY HAS TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS.  WE'RE A DEBTOR NATION, WE'RE A   SERIOUS DEBTOR NATION, AND WE   HAVE A COUNTRY THAT NEEDS NEW   ROADS, NEW TUNNELS, NEW   BRIDGES, NEW AIRPORTS, NEW SCHOOLS, NEW HOSPITALS, AND WE   DON'T HAVE THE MONEY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SQUANDERED ON SO MANY OF  IT WOULD BE  MAYBE HE DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB AND I WAS   UNSATISFIED WITH HIS WORK,   WHICH OUR COUNTRY  WRONG.  LOOK.  IT'S ALL WORDS.  IT'S ALL SOUND BYTES. I'VE BUILT AN UNBELIEVABLE   COMPANY. SOME OF THE GREATEST ASSETS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, REAL ESTATE ASSETS ANYWHERE IN THE   WORLD BEYOND THE UNITED STATES,  EUROPE, LOTS OF DIFFERENT   PLACES. IT'S AN UNBELIEVABLE COMPANY.  BUT ON OCCASION, FOUR TIMES, WE USED CERTAIN LAWS THAT ARE THERE. AND WHEN SECRETARY CLINTON TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T   GET PAID, FIRST OF ALL, THEY   DID GET PAID A LOT, BUT TAKING   ADVANTAGE OF THE LAWS OF THE NATION.  IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE LAWS,  YOU'VE BEEN THERE A LONG TIME,   CHANGE THE LAWS. BUT I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LAWS OF THE NATION, BECAUSE I'M RUNNING THE COMPANY. MY OBLIGATION RIGHT NOW IS TO DO WELL FOR MYSELF, MY FAMILY, MY EMPLOYEES, FOR MY COMPANIES   AND THAT'S WHAT I DO.  BUT WHAT SHE DOESN'T SAY IS THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE UNBELIEVABLY HAPPY AND THAT LOVE ME. I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.  WE'RE JUST OPENING UP ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE RIGHT NEXT TO THE WHITE HOUSE, SO IF I DON'T GET THERE ONE WAY, I'M GOING TO GET TO PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE ANOTHER.  BUT WE'RE OPENING THE OLD POST OFFICE.  UNDER BUDGET, AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, SAVE TREMENDOUS MONEY.  I'M A YEAR AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.  AND THAT'S WHAT THIS COUNTRY   SHOULD BE DOING.  WE BUILD ROADS AND BECAUSE TWO OR THREE OR FOUR TIMES WHAT   THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO COST, WE BUY PRODUCTS FOR OUR MILITARY   AND THEY COME AT COSTS THAT ARE SO FAR ABOVE WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE THAT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.  WHEN WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET, THE  BUDGET IS BAD TO A LARGE EXTENT  BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT   HAVE NO IDEA AS TO WHAT TO DO   AND HOW TO BUY.  THE TRUMP INTERNATIONAL IS WAY UNDER BUDGET AND WAY AHEAD OF   SCHEDULE, AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE  TO DO THAT FOR  FIRST OF ALL, SECRETARY CLINTON DOESN'T WANT TO USE A COUPLE OF WORDS, AND THAT'S ""LAW"" AND ""ORDER."" WE NEED LAW AND ORDER. IF WE DON'T HAVE IT, WE'RE NOT   GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY, AND   WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON   IN CHARLOTTE, A CITY I LOVE, A CITY WHERE I HAVE INVESTMENTS, WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON   THROUGHOUT VARIOUS PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY -- I CAN KEEP NAMING   THEM ALL DAY LONG.  WE NEED LAW AND ORDER IN OUR   COUNTRY.  AND I JUST GOT TODAY THE -- AS   YOU KNOW, THE ENDORSEMENT OF   THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE. WHICH JUST CAME IN.  WE HAVE ENDORSEMENTS FROM I THINK ALMOST EVERY POLICE   GROUP, VERY -- A LARGE   PERCENTAGE OF THEM IN THE   UNITED STATES. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE   HAVE OUR INNER CITIES, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANICS, ARE LIVING IN HELL BECAUSE IT'S SO DANGEROUS. YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET, YOU GET SHOT.  IN CHICAGO, THEY'VE HAD THOUSANDS OF SHOOTINGS, THOUSANDS, SINCE JANUARY 1ST. THOUSANDS OF SHOOTINGS. I SAY, WHERE IS THIS? IS THIS A WAR-TORN COUNTRY?   WHAT ARE WE DOING? AND WE HAVE TO STOP THE VIOLENCE.  WE HAVE TO BRING BACK LAW AND   ORDER.  IN A PLACE LIKE CHICAGO WHERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED.  THOUSANDS OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS.  IN FACT, ALMOST 4,000 HAVE BEEN  KILLED SINCE BARACK OBAMA BECAME PRESIDENT.  OVER FOUR -- ALMOST 4,000   PEOPLE IN CHICAGO HAVE BEEN   KILLED.  WE HAVE TO BRING BACK LAW AND ORDER.  NOW, WHETHER OR NOT IN A PLACE LIKE CHICAGO YOU DO STOP AND   FRISK, WHICH WORKED VERY WELL. MAYOR GIULIANI IS HERE.  IT WORKED VERY WELL IN NEW   YORK. IT BROUGHT THE CRIME RATE WAY   DOWN.  BUT YOU TAKE THE GUN AWAY FROM   CRIMINALS THAT SHOULDN'T BE   HAVING IT.  WE HAVE TO GANGS ROAMING THE STREETS.  AND IN MANY CASES, THEY'RE ILLEGALLY HERE. THEY'RE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.  AND THEY HAVE GUNS AND THEY   SHOOT PEOPLE. AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY STRONG. AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY   VIGILANT. WE HAVE TO BE -- WE HAVE TO   KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.  RIGHT NOW, OUR POLICE, IN MANY CASES, ARE AFRAID TO DO ANYTHING. WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR INNER CITIES, BECAUSE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES   ARE BEING DECIMATED BY CRIME. YOUR TWO MINUTES HAVE EXPIRED BUT I DO WANT TO FOLLOW UP.  STOP AND FRISK WAS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN NEW YORK BECAUSE IT LARGELY SINGLED OUT BLACK AND HISPANIC YOUNG MEN.  NO, YOU'RE WRONG.  IT WENT BEFORE A JUDGE, WHO WAS  A VERY AGAINST POLICE JOB.  IT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM HER, AND  OUR MAYOR, OUR NEW MAYOR,   REFUSED TO GO FORWARD WITH THE   CASE. THEY WOULD HAVE WON ON APPEAL.  IF YOU LOOKED AT IT THROUGHOUT   THE COUNTRY THERE ARE  NO, THE ARGUMENT IS WE HAVE TO TAKE THE GUNS   AWAY FROM PEOPLE THAT ARE BAD   PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM.  THESE ARE FELONS AND THESE ARE BAD PEOPLE -- WHEN YOU HAVE 3,000 SHOOTINGS IN CHICAGO FROM  JANUARY 1ST, WHEN YOU HAVE   4,000 PEOPLE KILLED IN CHICAGO   BY GUNS FROM THE BEGINNING OF   THE PRESIDENCY OF BARACK OBAMA, HIS HOME TOWN, YOU HAVE TO HAVE STOP AND FRISK. YOU NEED MORE POLICE. YOU NEED A BETTER COMMUNITY, YOU KNOW, RELATION.  YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD COMMUNITY   RELATIONS IN CHICAGO.  IT'S TERRIBLE.  I HAVE PROPERTY THERE. IT'S TERRIBLE WHAT'S GOING ON   IN CHICAGO. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK -- AND CHICAGO IS NOT THE ONLY ONE.  YOU GO TO FERGUSON. YOU GO TO SO MANY DIFFERENT PLACES.  YOU NEED BETTER RELATIONSHIPS. I AGREE WITH SECRETARY CLINTON   ON THIS.  YOU NEED BETTER RELATIONSHIPS   BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES AND THE  POLICE, BECAUSE IN SOME CASES IT'S NOT GOOD.  BUT YOU LOOK AT DALLAS WHERE THE RELATIONSHIPS WERE REALLY STUDIED.  THE RELATIONSHIPS WERE REALLY A  BEAUTIFUL THING. AND THEN FIVE POLICE OFFICERS WERE KILLED.  ONE NIGHT VERY VIOLENTLY.  SO THERE'S SOME BAD THINGS   GOING ON, SOME REALLY BAD THINGS.  BUT WE NEED -- LESTER, WE NEED   LAW AND ORDER AND WE NEED LAW   AND ORDER IN THE INNER CITIES BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE   MOST AFFECTED BY WHAT'S   HAPPENING ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC PEOPLE, AND IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO THEM WHAT OUR   POLITICIANS ARE ALLOWING TO  I'D LIKE TO RESPOND. FIRST OF ALL, I AGREE, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE EVEN WITHIN MY   OWN PARTY WANT TO GIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS TO PEOPLE ON WATCH LISTS  AND NO-FLY LISTS.  I AGREE WITH YOU.  WHEN A PERSON IS ON A WATCH   LIST OR A NO-FLY LIST AND I   HAVE THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE N.R.A., WHICH I'M VERY PROUD   OF.  THESE ARE VERY GOOD PEOPLE AND   THEY ARE PROTECTING THE SECOND AMENDMENT, BUT I THINK WE HAVE   TO LOOK VERY STRONGLY AT NO-FLY LISTS AND WATCH LISTS AND WHEN   PEOPLE ARE ON THERE, EVEN IF   THEY SHOULDN'T BE ON THERE, WE'LL HELP THEM, WE'LL HELP   THEM LEGALLY GET OFF, BUT I TEND TO AGREE WITH THAT, QUITE STRONGLY. I DO WANT TO BRING UP THE FACT   THAT YOU WERE THE ONE THAT   BROUGHT UP THE WORD ""SUPER PREDATOR"" ABOUT YOUNG, BLACK YOUTH AND THAT'S A TERM THAT I   THINK WAS A TERM THAT'S BEEN   HORRIBLY MET, AS YOU KNOW, AND   I THINK YOU'VE APOLOGIZED FOR   IT, BUT I THINK IT WAS A   TERRIBLE THING TO SAY.  AND WHEN IT COMES TO STOP AND FRISK, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT   TAKING GUNS AWAY.  I'M TALKING ABOUT TAKING GUNS   AWAY FROM GANGS AND PEOPLE THAT USE THEM AND I DON'T THINK -- I  REALLY DON'T THINK YOU DISAGREE WITH ME ON THIS, IF YOU WANT TO  KNOW THE TRUTH. I THINK MAYBE THERE'S A   POLITICAL REASON WHY YOU CAN'T   SAY IT, BUT I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE.  IN NEW YORK CITY, STOP AND   FRISK -- WE HAD 2200 MURDERS   AND STOP AND FRISK THERE'S A   POLITICAL REASON WHY BROUGHT IT   DOWN TO 500 MURDERS. 500 MURDERS IS A LOT OF   MURDERS. HARD TO BELIEVE 500 IS LIKE SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD. BUT WE WENT FROM 2200 TO 500 AND IT WAS CONTINUED ON BY MAYOR BLOOMBERG AND IT WAS TERMINATED BY THE CURRENT MAYOR  BUT STOP AND FRISK HAD A   TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE SAFETY  OF NEW YORK CITY, TREMENDOUS   BEYOND BELIEF.  SO WHEN YOU SAY IT HAS NO IMPACT, IT REALLY DID.  IT HAD A REALLY BIG IMPACT.  INCLUDING   MURDERS.   DONALD  NO, I'M NOT.   DONALD TRUMP: MURDERS ARE UP.  ALL RIGHT, YOU CHECK IT.  MAY I  THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS BEEN LET DOWN BY OUR   POLITICIANS. THEY TALK GOOD AROUND ELECTION   TIME LIKE RIGHT NOW AND AFTER THE ELECTION, THEY SAID, SEE   YOU LATER. I'LL SEE YOU IN FOUR YEARS. THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY -- LOOK, THE   COMMUNITY WITHIN THE INNER CITIES HAS BEEN SO BADLY TREATED, THEY'VE BEEN ABUSED AND USED IN ORDER TO GET VOTES BY DEMOCRAT POLITICIANS BECAUSE  THAT'S WHAT IT IS.  THEY'VE CONTROLLED THESE   COMMUNITIES FOR UP TO 100 YEARS.  IT'S BROKEN.  AND I WILL TELL YOU, YOU LOOK AT THE INNER CITIES, AND I JUST  LEFT DETROIT AND I JUST LEFT PHILADELPHIA.  YOU'VE SEEN ME. I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE.  YOU DECIDED TO STAY HOME, AND   THAT'S  BUT I WILL TELL   YOU, I'VE BEEN ALL OVER AND   I'VE MET SOME OF THE GREATEST   PEOPLE I'LL EVER MEET WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES AND THEY ARE VERY, VERY UPSET WITH WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE TOLD THEM AND WHAT THEIR POLITICIANS HAVE DONE.  WELL, IT'S VERY   SIMPLE TO SAY. SYDNEY BLOOMENTHAL WORKS FOR   THE CAMPAIGN AND A VERY CLOSE FRIEND OF SECRETARY CLINTON,   AND HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, PATTY DOYLE, WENT TO THE CAMPAIGN,   HER CAMPAIGN AGAINST PRESIDENT   OBAMA, FOUGHT VERY HARD, AND YOU CAN GO LOOK IT UP AND YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT, AND IF YOU LOOK AT CNN THIS PAST WEEK, PATTY DOYLE WAS ON WOLF BLITZER SAYING THAT THIS HAPPENED, BLOOMENTHAL SENT MCCLATHCHY, A   HIGHLY RESPECTED PRESIDENT, TO   QUESTION THE PRESIDENT VERY HARD ABOUT IT, SHE FAILED TO   GET THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE.  WHEN I GOT INVOLVED, I DIDN'T FAIL.  I GOT HIM TO GIVE THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE SO I'M SATISFIED WITH IT AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY   I'M SATISFIED WITH IT, BECAUSE   I WANT TO GET ON TO DEFEATING ISIS, BECAUSE I WANT TO GET ON   CREATING JOBS, BECAUSE I WANT   TO GET ON TO HAVING A STRONG BORDER, BECAUSE I WANT TO GET   ON TO THINGS THAT ARE VERY   IMPORTANT TO ME AND THAT ARE   VERY IMPORTANT  WELL, NOBODY WAS   PRESSING IT.  NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH ABOUT   IT.  I FIGURED YOU'D ASK THE QUESTION TONIGHT, OF COURSE, BUT NOBODY WAS CARING MUCH   ABOUT T BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT GOT HIM TO PRODUCE THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND I THINK I DID A  GOOD JOB.  SECRETARY CLINTON ALSO FOUGHT IT.  I MEAN, YOU KNOW, NOW,   EVERYBODY WILL SAY OH, IT'S NOT  TRUE. LOOK, IT'S TRUE.  SYDNEY BLOOMENTHAL SENT THE   REPORTER.  YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT  CNN, LAST WEEK, THE INTERVIEW WITH YOUR FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, AND SHE WAS INVOLVED. BUT JUST LIKE SHE CAN'T BRING BACK JOBS,  I SAY NOTHING   BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO GET HIM TO PRODUCE IT. HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED IT  A LONG TIME BEFORE. I SAY NOTHING. BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU, WHEN   YOU TALK ABOUT HEALING, I THINK  I'VE DEVELOPED VERY, VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIPS OVER THE LAST LITTLE WHILE WITH THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.  I THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT. AND I FEEL THAT THEY REALLY   WANTED ME TO COME TO THAT   CONCLUSION, AND I THINK I DID A  GREAT JOB AND A GREAT SERVICE   NOT ONLY FOR THE COUNTRY, BUT EVEN FOR THE PRESIDENT IN   GETTING HIM TO PRODUCE HIS  I'D LOVE TO RESPOND.  FIRST OF ALL, I GOT TO WATCH IN PREPARING FOR SOME OF YOUR DEBATES AGAINST OBAMA. YOU TREATED HIM WITH TERRIBLE DISRESPECT. AND I WATCHED HOW YOU TALK   ABOUT HOW LOVELY EVERYTHING IS   AND HOW WONDERFUL YOU ARE.  DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. YOU WERE AFTER HIM. YOU WERE TRYING TO SEND OUT, OR YOUR CAMPAIGN SENT OUT PICTURES  OF HIM IN A CERTAIN GARB, VERY   FAMOUS PICTURES.  I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DENY   THAT. BUT LAST WEEK, YOUR CAMPAIGN   MANAGER SAID IT WAS TRUE.  SO WHEN YOU TRY TO ACT HOLIER   THAN THOU, IT REALLY DOESN'T   WORK.  IT REALLY DOESN'T.  NOW, AS FAR AS THE LAWSUIT, YES, WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG, I   WENT INTO MY FATHER'S COMPANY,   HE HAD A REAL ESTATE COMPANY IN  BROOKLYN, IN QUEENS, AND WE, LIKE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES, BY THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT, WERE SUED, AND WE SETTLED WITHOUT   ADMISSION OF GUILT.  IT WAS EASY TO DO. I NOTICE YOU BRING THAT UP A LOT AND I   NOTICE THE NASTY COMMERCIALS YOU'RE DOING ON ME IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, WHICH I DON'T   DO ON YOU, MAYBE I'M TRYING TO   SAVE THE MONEY. BUT FRANKLY, I LOOK AT THAT AND I SAY, ISN'T THAT AMAZING? BECAUSE I SETTLED THAT LAWSUIT   WITH NO ADMISSION OF GUILT. BUT THAT WAS A LAWSUIT BROUGHT AGAINST MANY REAL ESTATE FIRMS. AND IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS.  I'LL GO ONE STEP FURTHER. IN PALM BEACH, FLORIDA, A   BRILLIANT COMMUNITY, PROBABLY   THE WEALTHIEST COMMUNITY THERE   IS IN THE WORLD, I OPENED THE CLUB, AND REALLY GOT GREAT   CREDIT FOR IT. NO DISCRIMINATION AGAINST   AFRICAN-AMERICANS, AGAINST MUSLIMS, AGAINST ANYBODI, AND   IT'S A TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL   CLUB AND I'M SO GLAD I DID IT, AND I HAVE BEEN GIVEN GREAT   CREDIT FOR WHAT I DID, AND I'M   VERY, VERY PROUD OF IT.  AND THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL.  THAT'S THE TRUE WAY I FEEL.  AND I DO WANT TO   SAY THAT I WAS JUST ENDORSED AND MORE ARE COMING NEXT WEEK.  IT WILL BE OVER 200 ADMIRALS.  MANY OF THEM ARE HERE. ADMIRALS AND GENERALS ENDORSED   ME TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY. THAT JUST HAPPENED AND MANY MORE ARE COMING.  I'M VERY PROUD OF IT.  IN ADDITION, I WAS JUST ENDORSED BY ICE. THEY'VE NEVER ENDORSED ANYBODY BEFORE, ON IMMIGRATION.  I WAS JUST ENDORSED BY ICE.  I WAS JUST RECENTLY ENDORSED 16,500 BORDER PATROL AGENTS. WHEN SECRETARY CLINTON TALKS ABOUT THIS, I'LL TAKE THE   ADMIRALS AND I'LL TAKE THE   GENERALS ANY DAY OVER THE   POLITICAL HACKS THAT I SEE THAT  HAVE LED OUR COUNTRY SO BRILLIANTLY OVER THE LAST 10   YEARS WITH THEIR KNOWLEDGE,   OKAY, BECAUSE LOOK AT THE MESS   THAT WE'RE IN.  LOOK AT THE MESS WE'RE IN.  AS FAR AS THE CYBER, I AGREE,   TO PARTS OF WHAT SECRETARY   CLINTON SAID. WE SHOULD BE BETTER THAN   ANYBODY ELSE AND PERHAPS WE'RE   NOT. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS THAT IT WAS RUSSIA THAT BROKE INTO THE DNC.  SHE'S SAYING RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA. MAYBE IT WAS.  IT COULD BE RUSSIA BUT IT COULD BE CHINA.  IT COULD BE LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE.  IT COULD BE SOMEBODY SITTING ON  THEIR BED THAT WEIGHS 400   POUNDS, OKAY.  YOU DON'T KNOW WHO BROKE INTO DNC. BUT WHAT DID WE LEARN WITH DNC? WE LEARNED THAT BERNIE SANDERS   WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY YOUR PEOPLE, BY DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. BERNIE SANDERS WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. NOW, WHETHER THAT WAS RUSSIA, WHETHER IT WAS CHINA, WHETHER IT WAS ANOTHER COUNTRY, WE   DON'T KNOW, BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS ANOTHER PRESIDENT OBAMA WE'VE LOST CONTROL OF THINGS THAT WE USED TO HAVE CONTROL OVER. WE CAME IN WITH THE INTERNET,   WE CAME UP WITH THE INTERNET   AND I THINK SECRETARY CLINTON   AND MYSELF WOULD AGREE VERY   MUCH WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT ISIS  IS DOING WITH THE INTERNET,   THEY'RE BEATING US AT OUR OWN GAME, ISIS.  SO WE HAVE TO GET VERY TOUGH ON CYBER AND CYBER WARFARE.  IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM.  I HAVE A SON.  HE'S 10 YEARS OLD.  HE HAS COMPUTERS.  HE IS SO GOOD WITH THESE COMPUTERS.  IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.  THE SECURITY ASPECT OF CYBER IS  VERY TOUGH AND MAYBE IT'S HARDLY DOABLE. BUT I WILL SAY, WE ARE NOT   DOING THE JOB WE SHOULD BE   DOING BUT THAT'S TRUE   THROUGHOUT OUR WHOLE   GOVERNMENTAL SOCIETY.  WE HAVE SO MANY THINGS WE HAVE   TO DO BETTER LESTER AND CYBER IS ONE OF THEM.  FIRST, YOU HAVE   TO SAY ONE THING, VERY IMPORTANT.  SECRETARY CLINTON IS TALKING   ABOUT TAKING OUT ISIS. WE WILL TAKE OUT ISIS. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SECRETARY CLINTON CREATED A VACUUM THE WAY THEY GOT OUT OF IRAQ, BECAUSE THEY GOT OUT WHAT THEY   SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN. BUT ONCE THEY GOT IN, THE WAY   THEY GOT OUT WAS A DISASTER AND ISIS WAS FORMED. SHE TALKS ABOUT TAKING THEM OUT.  SHE'S BEEN DOING IT A LONG   TIME.  SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO TAKE THEM   OUT A LONG TIME.  BUT THEY WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE   BEEN FORMED IF THEY LEFT SOME TROOPS BEHIND, LIKE 10,000 OR   MAYBE SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT,  AND THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THEM.  OR AS I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG TIME AND I THINK YOU'LL AGREE BECAUSE I SAID IT TO YOU   ONCE.  I BELIEVE TAKING THE OIL -- AND  WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE   OIL -- ISIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN  ABLE TO FORM EITHER BECAUSE THE  OIL WAS THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE OF  INCOME. AND NOW THEY HAVE THE OIL ALL OVER THE PLACE INCLUDING A LOT OF THE OIL IN LIBYA, WHICH WAS ANOTHER ONE OF  OF IRAQ.  WRONG. HILLARY CLINTON: HE ACTUALLY ADVOCATED FOR THE ACTIONS WE   TOOK IN LIB WRA LIBYA AND URGED QADDAFI BE TAKEN OUT AFTER   DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM.  HE SAYS THIS CONSTANTLY, IS GEORGE W. BUSH MADE THE AGREEMENT ABOUT WHEN AMERICAN TROOPS WOULD LEAVE IRAQ, NOT OBAMA.  AND THE ONLY WAY THAT AMERICAN TROOPS COULD HAVE STAYED IN IRAQ IS TO GET AN AGREEMENT   FROM THE THEN IRAQI GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD HAVE PROTECTED OUR   TROOPS, AND THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT GIVE THAT.  BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE   QUESTION YOU ASKED, LESTER.  THE QUESTION YOU ASKED IS WHAT   DO WE DO HERE IN THE UNITED   STATES? THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PART   OF THIS. HOW DO WE PREVENT ATTACKS?   HOW DO WE PROTECT OUR PEOPLE?   AND I THINK WE'VE GOT TO HAVE AN INTELLIGENCE SURGE WHERE WE   ARE LOOKING FOR EVERY SCRAP OF   INFORMATION. I WAS SO PROUD OF LAW   ENFORCEMENT IN NEW YORK, IN   MINNESOTA, IN NEW JERSEY.  YOU KNOW, THEY RESPONDED SO QUICKLY, SO PROFESSIONALLY TO   THE ATTACKS THAT OCCURRED BY RAHAMI , AND THEY BROUGHT HIM DOWN, AND WE MAY FIND OUT MORE   INFORMATION BECAUSE HE IS STILL  ALIVE, WHICH MAY PROVE TO BE AN  INTELLIGENCE BENEFIT.  SO WE'VE GOT TO DO EVERYTHING   WE CAN TO VACUUM UP   INTELLIGENCE FROM EUROPE, FROM THE MIDDLE EAST, THAT MEANS   WE'VE GOT TO WORK MORE CLOSELY   WITH OUR ALLIES. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT DONALD HAS BEEN VERY DISMISSIVE  OF. WE ARE WORKING WITH NATO, THE   LONGEST MILITARY ALLIANCE IN   THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, TO   REALLY TURN OUR ATTENTION TO   TERRORISM. WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR FRIENDS   IN THE MIDDLE EAST, MANY OF   WHICH AS YOU KNOW ARE MUSLIM MAJORITY NATIONS.  DONALD HAS CONSISTENTLY INSULTED MUSLIMS ABROAD AND AT HOME WHEN WE NEED TO BE COOPERATING WITH MUSLIM NATIONS AND THE MUSLIM AMERICAN COMMUNITY.  THEY'RE ON THE FRONT LINES.  THEY CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION TO  US THAT WE MAY NOT GET ANYWHERE ELSE.  THEY NEED TO HAVE CLOSE WORKING  OPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT   IN THESE COMMUNITIES, NOT BE ALIENATED AND PUSHED AWAY AS   SOME OF DONALD'S RHETORIC   UNFORTUNATELY HAS LED  THE SECRETARY SAID VERY STRONGLY ABOUT WORKING WITH -- WE'VE BEEN   WORKING WITH THEM FOR MANY   YEARS, AND WE HAVE THE GREATEST MESS ANYONE'S EVER SEEN.  YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE EAST.  IT'S A TOTAL MESS.  UNDER YOUR DIRECTION, TO A   LARGE EXTENT.  BUT YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE EAST. YOU STARTED THE IRAN DEAL.  THAT'S ANOTHER BEAUTY WHERE YOU  HAVE A COUNTRY READY TO FALL,   THEY WERE DOING SO BADLY.  THEY WERE CHOKING ON THE   SANCTIONS AND THEY'RE GOING TO   BE A MAJOR POWER AT SOME POINT   THE WAY THEY'RE GOING. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT NATO -- I WAS ASKING ON A MAJOR SHOW,   WHAT DO YOU THINK OF NATO.  I'M A BUSINESSMAN.  BUT I HAVE COMMON SENSE.  I SAID, WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, I   HAVEN'T GIVEN LOTS OF THOUGHT   TO NATO BUT TWO THINGS.  NUMBER 1, THE 28 COUNTRIES OF   NATO, MANY OF THEM AREN'T   PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. NUMBER 2, THAT BOTHERS ME,   BECAUSE WE'RE DEFENDING THEM AND THEY SHOULD BE AT LEAST   PAYING US WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED  TO BE PAYING BY TREATY AND   CONTRACT, AND, NUMBER 2, I SAID  AND VERY STRONGLY, NATO COULD BE OBSOLETE BECAUSE -- AND I WAS VERY STRONG ON THIS, AND IT WAS ACTUALLY COVERED VERY   ACCURATELY IN THE NEW YORK   TIMES WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES, TO BE HONEST. BUT I SAID THEY DO NOT FOCUS ON  TERROR, AND I WAS VERY STRONG. AND I SAID IT NUMEROUS TIMES. AND ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO I READ ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THAT NATO IS OPENING UP A MAJOR TERROR DIVISION AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT. AND I THINK WE SHOULD   GET -- BECAUSE WE PAY APPROXIMATELY 73% OF THE COST OF NATO, IT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO  PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE, BUT I'M   ALL FOR NATO, BUT I SAID THEY   HAVE TO FOCUS ON TERROR ALSO.  AND THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT.  AND THAT WAS, BELIEVE ME, NOT GOING TO GET CREDIT FOR IT, BUT  THAT WAS LARGELY BECAUSE OF   WHAT I WAS SAYING AND MY   CRITICISM OF NATO.  I THINK WE HAVE TO GET NATO TO   GO INTO THE MIDDLE EAST WITH US, IN ADDITION TO SURROUNDING NATIONS, AND WE HAVE TO KNOCK   THE HELL OUT OF ISIS AND WE   HAVE TO DO IT FAST.  WHEN ISIS FORMED IN THIS VACUUM  CREATED BY BARACK OBAMA AND   SECRETARY CLINTON,   AND -- BELIEVE ME, YOU WERE THE  ONES THAT TOOK OUT THE   TROOPS -- NOT ONLY THAT, YOU   NAMED THE DAY -- THEY COULDN'T   BELIEVE IT.  THEY SAT BACK AND SAID   PROBABLY -- WAIT A MINUTE. WHEN THEY FORMED -- THIS IS   SOMETHING THAT NEVER SHOULD   HAVE HAPPENED.  IT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING OUT ISIS, BUT YOU WERE THERE AND   YOU WERE SECRETARY OF STATE WHEN IT WAS A LITTLE INFANT.  NOW IT'S IN OVER 30 COUNTRIES. AND YOU'RE GOING TO STOP THEM?   I DON'T THINK SO.  I DID NOT SUPPORT  THE WAR IN IRAQ. THAT IS A MAINSTREAM MEDIA NONSENSE PUT OUT BY HER BECAUSE SHE FRANKSLY, I THINK THE BEST PERSON IN HER CAMPAIGN IS MAIN STREAM MEDIA. WAIT A MINUTE.  I WAS AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ.  IT DOES NOT SHOW THAT.  THE RECORD SHOWS THAT I'M   RIGHT. WHEN I DID AN INTERVIEW WITH   HOWARD STERN, VERY LIGHTLY, FIRST TIME ANYONE'S ASKED ME THAT, I SAID VERY LIGHTLY, I   DON'T KNOW, MAYBE, WHO KNOWS, ESSENTIALLY.  I THEN DID AN INTERVIEW WITH NEIL CAVUTO.  WE TALKED ABOUT THE ECONOMY IS MORE IMPORTANT.  I THEN SPOKE TO SEAN HANITY.  I HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH SEAN HANITY AT FOX SPSHGS   HE CALLED ME THE OTHER DAY AND   I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT IT, HE   SAID YOU WERE TOTALLY AGAINST   IT, EXCUSE ME, IT WAS BEFORE   THE WAR STARTED.  SEAN HANITY SAID STRONGLY, TO ME AND OTHER PEOPLE AND HE'S WILLING TO SAY BUT NOBODY WANTS  TO CALL HIM.  HE SAID I WAS AGAINST THE WAR.  HE USED TO HAVE FIGHTS WITH ME   BECAUSE SEAN WAS IN FAVOR OF   THE WAR.  AND I UNDERSTAND THAT SIDE   ALSO, NOT VERY MUCH BECAUSE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE.  NOBODY CALLS SEAN HANITY AND   THEY DID AN ARTICLE IN THE   MAJOR MAGAZINE SHORTLY AFTER   THE WAR STARTED I THINK IN '04, BUT THEY DID AN ARTICLE WHICH   HAD ME TOTALLY AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ, AND ONE OF YOUR COMPATRIATES SAID YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT WAS BEFORE OR RIGHT AFTER, TRUMP WAS DEFINITELY -- IF YOU READ THIS ARTICLE, THERE WAS NO DOUBT. IF SOMEBODY WOULD CALL UP SEAN HANITY -- THIS WAS BEFORE THE WAR STARTED, HE AND I USED TO   HAVE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE WAR.  I SAID IT'S A TERRIBLE AND A STUPID THING. IT'S GOING TO DESTABILIZE THE   MIDDLE EAST, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT'S DONE.  I HAVE MUCH BETTER JUDGMENT THAN SHE DOES.  THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.  I ALSO HAVE MUCH BETTER   TEMPERAMENT THAN SHE HAS, YOU KNOW.  I HAVE MUCH BETTER -- LET ME   TELL YOU.  SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON ADVERTISING UBER KNOW  -- YOU KNOW, THEY GET MADISON   AVENUE INTO A ROOM.  I THINK MY STRONGEST ASSET   MAYBE BY FAR IS BY TEMPERAMENT.  I HAVE A WINNING TEMPERAMENT.  I KNOW HOW TO WIN. SHE DOES NOT. THE OTHER DAY, BEHIND THE BLUE   SCREEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU   WERE TALKING TO, SECRETARY CLINTON, BUT YOU WERE TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL.  I SAID THERE'S A PERSON WITH A TEMPERAMENT THAT'S GOT  THAT IS GETTING A  LITTLE BIT OLD, I MUST SAY.  IT'S NOT AN   ACCURATE ONE AT ALL.  NOT AN ACCURATE ONE.  I JUST WANTED TO GIVE A LOT OF   THINGS TO RESPOND. I AGREE WITH HER ON ONE THING.  THE SINGLE GREATEST PROBLEM THE  WORLD HAS IS NUCLEAR ARMAMENT,   NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  NOT GLOBAL WARMING LIKE YOU THINK AND YOUR PRESIDENT THINKS. NUCLEAR IS THE SINGLE GREATEST   THREAT. JUST TO GO DOWN THE LIST, WE   DEFEND JAPAN. WE DEFEND GERMANY. WE DEFEND SOUTH KOREA. WE DEFEND SAUDI ARABIA. WE DEFEND COUNTRIES. THEY DO NOT PAY US WHAT THEY SHOULD BE PAYING US BECAUSE WE   ARE PROVIDING TREMENDOUS   SERVICE AND WE ARE LOSING A FORTUNE. THAT'S WHY WE'RE LOSING. WE LOSE ON EVERYTHING. WHO MAKES THESE -- WE LOSE ON EVERYTHING.  ALL I SAID, THAT IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT IF THEY DON'T PAY  A FAIR SHARE -- BECAUSE THIS ISN'T 40 YEARS AGO WHERE WE   COULD DO WHAT WE'RE DOING -- WE CAN'T DEFEND JAPAN, A BEHEMMOTH,  WAIT, IT'S VERY   IMPORTANT.  THEY MAY HAVE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES OR THEY MAY HAVE TO   HELP US OUT, A COUNTRY THAT OWES $20 TRILLION.  THEY HAVE TO HELP US OUT.  AS FAR AS THE NUCLEAR IS CONCERNED, I AGREE. IT IS THE SINGLE GREATEST   THREAT THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS.  I HAVE TO SAY   THAT FOR WHAT SECRETARY CLINTON  WAS SAYING ABOUT NUCLEAR WITH   RUSSIA, SHE'S VERY CAVALIER IN   THE WAY SHE TALKS ABOUT VARIOUS  COUNTRIES, BUT RUSSIA HAS BEEN   A STANDING -- THEY HAVE A MUCH   NEWER CAPABILITY THAN WE DO.  WE HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATING FROM THE NEW STANDPOINT. I LOOKED THE OTHER NIGHT.  I WAS SEEING B-52S.  THEY WERE OLD ENOUGH THAT YOUR   FATHER AND GRANDFATHER COULD BE  FLYING THEM.  WE ARE NOT KEEPING UP WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. I WOULD LIKE EVERYBODY TO END   IT, JUST GET RID OF IT, BUT NOT TO FIRST STRIKE.  I THINK THAT ONCE THE NUCLEAR ALTERNATIVE HAPPENS, IT'S OVER. AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED.  I CAN'T TAKE ANYTHING OFF THE   TABLE, BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT SOME  OF THESE COUNTRIES, YOU LOOK AT NORTH KOREA.  WE'RE DOING NOTHING THERE. CHINA SHOULD SOLVE THAT PROBLEM  FOR US.  CHINA SHOULD GO INTO NORTH KOREA.  CHINA IS TOTALLY POWERFUL AS IT  RELATES TO NORTH KOREA.  BY THE WAY, ANOTHER ONE   POWERFUL IS THE WORST DEAL I   EVER SEEN NEGOTIATED IS THE IRAN DEAL. IRAN HAS POWER OVER NORTH KOREA.  WHEN THEY MADE THAT HORRIBLE DEAL WITH IRAN, IT SHOULD HAVE   INCLUDED THE FACT THAT THEY DO SOMETHING WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA.  AND THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING WITH RESPECT TO YEMEN AND ALL THESE OTHER PLACES. AND WHEN ASKED TO SECRETARY KERRY, WHY DIDN'T DO YOU THAT?   WHY DIDN'T YOU ADD OTHER THINGS  INTO THE DEAL?   ONE OF THE GREAT GIVE AWAYS OF   ALL TIME, OF ALL TIME,   INCLUDING $400 MILLION IN CASH,  NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN THAT   BEFORE, THAT TURNED OUT TO BE   WRONG. IT WAS ACTUALLY $1.7 BILLION IN CASH, OBVIOUSLY, I GUESS FOR   THE HOSTAGES, IT CERTAINLY   LOOKS THAT WAY.  SO YOU SAY TO YOURSELF, WHY DIDN'T THEY MAKE THE RIGHT DEAL?   THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST DEALS   EVER MADE BY ANY COUNTRY IN HISTORY. WOULD LEAD TO NUCLEAR PROBLEMS.  ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS SET BACK   10 YEARS AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO  DO MUCH.  I MET WITH NETANYAHU THE OTHER   DAY.  HE IS NOT A HAPPY CAMPER.  I'D LIKE TO SAY  REALLY QUICKLY. DONALD TRUMP: I WILL TELL YOU THAT HILLARY WILL TELL YOU TO   GO TO HER WEB SITE AND READ ABOUT HOW TO DEFEAT ISIS, WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN DEFEATED BY NOT HAVING IT GET GOING IN THE   FIRST PLACE. IT'S GETTING TOUGHER AND   TOUGHER BECAUSE THEY'RE IN MORE  AND MORE PLACES, MORE AND MORE STATES AND MORE AND MORE   NATIONS AND IT'S A BIG PROBLEM   AND AS FAR AS JAPAN IS CONCERNED I WANT TO HELP ALL OF  OUR ALLIES, BUT WE ARE LOSEING   BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  WE CANNOT BE THE POLICEMEN OF   THE WORLD.  WE CANNOT PROTECT COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD WHEN THEY'RE NOT  PAYING US WHAT WE NEED.  SHE DOESN'T SAY THAT BECAUSE SHE HAS NO BUSINESS ABILITY.  WE NEED HEART AND A LOT OF THINGS BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE   SOME BUSINESS ABILITY.  SHE DOESN'T HAVE THAT.  A LOT OF THE THINGS SHE'S   TALKING ABOUT COULD HAVE BEEN   TAKEN CARE OF IN THE LAST 10   YEARS WHEN SHE HAD GREAT POWER   BUT THEY WEREN'T TAKEN CARE OF   AND IF SHE WINS THIS PRESIDENCY, THEY WON'T BE TAKEN CARE  SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK OR THE STAM NACHLT SHE  DOESN'T HAVE THE STAMINA. TO BE PRESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY, YOU NEED TREMENDOUS   STAM NACHLT WAIT A MINUTE, LESTER, YOU ASKED ME A QUESTION.  DID YOU ASK ME A QUESTION?   YOU YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO   NEGOTIATE TRADE DEALS.  YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO   NEGOTIATE TEST SITES WITH JAPAN, WITH SAUDI ARABIA.  CAN YOU IMAGINE WITH THIS WITH   SAUDI ARABIA, WITH ALL THE MONEY DEFENDING THEM AND THEM   NOT PAYING, YOU HAVE SO MANY   THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO AND I BELIEVE HILLARY HAS THE STAMINA.  WELL, LET ME TELL  YOU.  HILLARY HAS EXPERIENCE, BUT   IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE.  WE HAVE MADE SO MANY BAD DEALS   DURING THE LAST.   SO SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE, I   THINK, BUT IT'S BAD, BAD EXPERIENCE.  WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL THAT  YOU'RE SO IN LOVE WITH WHERE YOU GAVE THEM $150 BILLION BACK.  WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL. WHETHER IT'S ANYTHING -- YOU ALMOST CAN'T NAME A GOOD DEAL.  I AGREE SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S BAD EXPERIENCE AND   THIS COUNTRY CAN'T AFFORD TO   HAVE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF  INCONVENIENCE   TO EMPLOYERS. DONALD TRUMP: I NEVER SAID  WHERE DID  OKAY,  LET ME JUST TELL YOU.  HILLARY HAS HIT   ME WITH TREMENDOUS COMMERCIALS.  SOME OF IT'S ENTERTAINMENT.  SOME OF IT SAID SOMEBODY WHO   USED TO BE NEAR ME, ROSIE O'DON  O'DONNELL , I THINK YOU WOULD   AGREE SHE DESERVED IT AND   NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR HER.  BUT I WAS GOING TO SAY TO HILLARY, TO HER FAMILY, AND I   SAID TO MYSELF, I CAN'T DO IT.  I JUST CAN'T DO IT.  IT'S INAPPROPRIATE.  IT'S NOT NICE.  BUT SHE SPENT HUNDREDS OF   MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON NEGATIVE  ADS ON ME, MANY OF WHICH ARE   ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE.  THEY'RE UNTRUE AND THEY'RE MISREPRESENTATIONS AND I WILL   TELL YOU THIS LESTER, IT IS NOT NICE, AND I DON'T DESERVE THAT,  BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A NICE   THING THAT SHE'S DONE.  IT'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF ADS AND THE ONLY GRATIFYING THING IS I SAW THE POLLS COME   IN TODAY, AND WITH ALL OF THAT   MONEY, OVER $200 MILLION SPENT   AND EITHER WINNING OR TIED AND   I SPENT PRACTICALLY NOTHING.  I WANT TO MAKE   AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  WE ARE A NATION THAT IS SERIOUSLY TROUBLED.  WE'RE LOSING OUR JOBS.  PEOPLE ARE POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY.  THE OTHER DAY, WE WERE DEPORTING 800 PEOPLE AND PERHAPS THEY PASSED THE WRONG BUTTON, PRESSED THE WRONG   BUTTON OR PERHAPS WORSE THAN   THAT, IT WAS CORRUPTION.  BUT THESE PEOPLE THAT WE WERE   GOING TO DEPORT FOR GOOD REASON  ENDED UP BECOMING CITIZENS,   ENDED UP BECOMING CITIZENS.  AND IT WAS 800 AND NOW IT TURNS  OUT IT MIGHT BE 1800 AND THEY   DON'T EVEN KNOW.  I WANT TO MAKE   AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT.  I DON'T BELIEVE HILLARY WILL.  THE ANSWER IS, IF SHE WINS, I   WILL ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT HER.",Presidential Candidates Debate

IT'S A GREAT HONOR TO BE WITH YOU.  WE HAD SOME REALLY INCREDIBLE THINGS HAPPEN TODAY.  THE POLLS ARE COMING OUT, WE'RE LEADING IN SO MANY POLLS.   I CAN'T TELL YOU, I DON'T KNOW   WHERE TO BEGIN. BUT THAT'S A GOOD FEELING. WE ARE, I GUESS CNN JUST CAME OUT, WE'RE LEADING NATIONWIDE   WITH CNN. WE'RE LEADING IN OHIO AND WE'RE   LEADING JUST -- I THINK IT JUST   CAME OUT, WE'RE LEADING IN   NORTH CAROLINA, FLORIDA, WE'RE   LEADING AND WE'RE HAVING A LOT   OF FUN.   WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF FUN ON   THE CAMPAIGN. AND ON THE TRAIL.   I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THE   ALWAYS A LOT OF FUN WHEN YOU   COME UP AND THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE TELEPROMPTER WORKING,   BUT THAT'S OK.  LUCKY I BROUGHT SOME NOTES.   TODAY I DO WANT TO OUTLINE A PLAN FOR AMERICAN ECONOMIC   REVIE VALUE.  IT'S A BOLD AND AMBITIOUS AND FORWARD-LOOKING PLAN TO   MASSIVELY INCREASE JOBS, WAGES,   INCOME AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR   THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY. GREAT PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY.  I WILL TELL YOU.  MY PLAN WILL EMBRACE THE TRUTH THAT PEOPLE FLOURISH UNDER A MINIMUM GOVERNMENT BURDEN AND   WILL TAP INTO THE INCREDIBLE UNREALIZED POTENTIAL OF OUR   WORKERS AND THEIR DREAMS.   RIGHT NOW 92 MILLION AMERICANS   ARE ON THE SIDELINE OUTSIDE OF   THE WORK FORCE AND THEY'RE NOT   A PART OF OUR ECONOMY. IT'S A SILENT NATION OF JOBLESS   AMERICANS. AND LOOK NO FURTHER, AND I MEAN   NO FURTHER, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT FLINT, WHERE I SPENT   A LOT OF TIME, THE CITY OF FLINT.  AND WHAT A DISASTER HAS TAKEN PLACE.  THE JOBS HAVE BEEN STRIPPED FROM THE COMMUNITY AND ITS   INFRASTRUCTURE HAS TOTALLY COLLAPSED. IN 1970 THERE WERE MORE THAN 80,000 PEOPLE IN FLINT WORKING FOR GENERAL MOTORS.   TODAY IT'S LESS THAN 8,000. THAT'S GOING DOWN.  AND THEY'RE MAKING VERY, VERY LITTLE AND PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GO DOWN TO THAT $8,000 MARK. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS FORD, FORD HAS ANNOUNCED JUST YESTERDAY THAT THEY'RE MOVING THEIR SMALL CAR PRODUCTION FACILITIES TO MEXICO.   AND I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT   THIS A LONG WHILE AND I THINK   THAT'S MAYBE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE'RE DOING SO WELL IN OHIO AND MICHIGAN AND LOTS OF OTHER PLACES WHERE CARS AND   PARTS ARE INVOLVED. TO THINK THAT FORD IS MOVING ITS SMALL CAR DIVISION IS A DISGRACE. IT'S DISGRACEFUL. DISGRACEFUL THAT OUR POLITICIANS ALLOW THEM TO GET   AWAY WITH IT.   REALLY IS. IT USED TO BE CARS WERE MADE IN   FLINT AND YOU COULDN'T DRINK THE WATER IN MEXICO.  NOW CARS ARE MADE IN MEXICO AND   YOU CAN'T DRINK THE WATER IN FLINT.  WE'RE GOING TO TURN THIS AROUND  . MY ECONOMIC PLAN REJECTS THE CYNICISM THAT SAVES OUR LABOR  -- SAYS OUR LABOR FORCE WILL KEEP DECLINING, THAT OUR JOBS   WILL KEEP LEAVING. AND THAT OUR ECONOMY CAN NEVER GROW AS IT DID ONCE BEFORE. AND BOY, OH, BOY, DID IT USED   TO GROW.  WE REJECT THE PESSIMISM THAT   SAYS OUR STANDARD OF LIVING CAN NO LONGER RISE AND THAT'S ALL   THERE IS REALLY LEFT TO DIVIDE BECAUSE FRANKLY WE'RE LOOKING   AT AN ECONOMY NOW OF NO GROWTH   AND REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH. AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.   EVERYTHING THAT IS BROKEN TODAY   CAN BE FIXED AND EVERY FAILURE   CAN BE TURNED INTO A TRULY   GREAT SUCCESS.  JUST LOOK AT THE WAY I JUST   MELDED INTO THE TELEPROMPTER   THAT JUST WENT ON.  WHO ELSE COULD HAVE PULLED THAT   OFF, OK, WHO ELSE.  JOBS CAN STOP LEAVING OUR   COUNTRY AND THEY WILL JUST ABSOLUTELY START PORING IN. FAILING SCHOOLS CAN BECOME FLOURISHING SCHOOLS.  CRUMBLING ROADS AND BRIDGES CAN BECOME GLEAMING NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. INNER CITIES CAN EXPERIENCE A   FLOOD OF NEW JOBS AND   INVESTMENT AND RISING CRIME CAN   GIVE WAY TO SAFE AND PROSPEROUS   COMMUNITIES. ALL OF THESE THINGS AND SO MUCH MORE ARE POSSIBLE.  BUT TO ACCOMPLISH THEM WE MUST   REPLACE THE PRESENT POLICY OF GLOBALISM, WHICH HAS TAKEN SO   MANY JOBS OUT OF OUR COMMUNITIES, AND SO MUCH WEALTH OUT OF OUR COUNTRY, AND WE PLACE IT WITH A NEW POLICY OF AMERICANISM.  AMERICA FIRST.  REMEMBER THAT.  UNDERSTAND THIS AMERICAN   SYSTEM, EVERY POLICY DECISION   WE MAKE MUST PASS A SIMPLE TEST.   DOES IT CREATE MORE JOBS AND BETTER WAGES FOR AMERICANS? THE TEST.   IF WE LOWER OUR TAXES, REMOVE   DESTRUCTIVE REGULATIONS AND WE HAVE TO DO THAT, UNLEAVE THE VAST -- UNLEASH THE VAST   TREASURE OF AMERICAN ENERGY AND NEGOTIATE TRADE DEALS THAT PUT   AMERICA FIRST, THEN THERE IS NO   LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF JOBS WE   CAN CREATE AND THE AMOUNT OF PROSPERITY WE CAN UNLEASH.  AMERICA WILL TRULY BE THE GREATEST PLACE IN THE WORLD TO INVEST, HIRE, GROW AND TO CREATE NEW JOBS, NEW TECHNOLOGIES, AND ENTIRE NEW INDUSTRY. INSTEAD -- THANK YOU.   INSTEAD OF DRIVING JOBS AND   WEALTH AWAY, AMERICA WILL   BECOME THE WORLD'S GREAT MAGNET FOR INNOVATION AND JOB CREATION.   MY OPPONENT'S PLAN REJECTS THIS OPTIMISM.   SHE OFFERS ONLY MORE TAXING AND   HER TAX INCREASES ARE UNBELIEVABLE. MORE REGULATING. MORE SPENDING.  AND MORE WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION.   A FUTURE OF SLOW GROWTH, DECLINING INCOMES AND DWINDLING PROSPERITY.   THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO GET RICH UNDER HILLARY CLINTON ARE THE   DONORS OF THE SPECIAL INTERESTS.  BUT BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY. AND HILLARY CLINTON'S AMERICA,   WE HAVE SURRENDERED OUR STATUS AS THE WORLD'S GREAT ECONOMY. AND WE HAVE SURRENDERED OUR   MIDDLE CLASS TO THE WHIMS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES. WE TAKE CARE OF THEM BETTER THAN WE TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES.   NOT ONE SINGLE IDEA SHE'S GOT   WILL CREATE ONE NET AMERICAN   JOB OR CREATE ONE NEW DOLLAR OF   AMERICAN WEALTH FOR OUR   WORKERS. THE ONLY THING SHE CAN OFFER IS A WELFARE CHECK. THAT'S ABOUT IT. OUR PLAN WILL PRODUCE PAYCHECKS AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE GREAT   PAYCHECKS FOR MILLIONS OF   PEOPLE NOW UNEMPLOYED OR UNDEREMPLOYED.  IN THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN,   I'VE TRAVELED ALL ACROSS THE   COUNTRY AND I'VE MET THE MOST AMAZING PEOPLE. EVERY DAY I'VE SEEN THE GOOD   THENESS AND CHARACTER OF OUR COUNTRY -- GOODNESS AND CHARACTER OF OUR COUNTRY AND BRAVE CITIZENS PROUDLY FIGHTING   THROUGH HARD TIMES AND DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. I HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY, FOR EXAMPLE.   AND WE HAVE UNBELIEVABLE -- COUNTRY, FOLKS, AND WE HAVE UNBELIEVABLE PEOPLE. BUT THEY NEED LEADERSHIP.   THE COUNTRY NEEDS LEADERSHIP. IN MANY PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY,   THE HARD TIMES NEVER SEEM TO END. I VISITED CITIES AND TOWNS IN   UPSTATE NEW YORK WHERE HALF OF THE JOBS HAVE LEFT AND MOVED TO MEXICO AND OTHER COUNTRIES. THE BUSINESSES ARE GONE, THEY'VE BEEN TAKEN AWAY, LIKE   TAKING CANDSY FROM A BABY.  POLITICIANS HAVE ABANDONED   THESE PLACES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE ARE JUST THERE.   NO HOPE. WORST STILL, POLITICIANS HAVE   HEAPED SCORN AND DISDAIN ON THESE WONDERFUL AMERICANS.  MY OPPONENT DESCRIBED TENSES OF   MILLIONS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS AS DEPLORABLE AND IRREDEEMABLE   JUST LAST WEEK. SO HOW CAN HILLARY CLINTON SEEK TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY WHEN SHE CONSIDERS ITS CITIZENS,   TREMENDOUS, TREMENDOUS NUMBERS   OF THEM, BEYOND REDEMPTION? THE HARDWORKING PEOPLE SHE   CALLS DEPLORABLE ARE THE MOST   ADMIRABLE PEOPLE I KNOW. THEY'RE COPS.   AND SOLDIERS. TEACHERS AND FIREFIGHTERS.  YOUNG AND OLD.  MOMS AND DADS. BLACKS AND WHITES. LATINOS.  ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE, THEY'RE AMERICANS.  SOME ARE RICH AMERICANS, SOME   ARE POOR AMERICANS. THEY'RE AMERICANS.  THEY LOVE THEIR FAMILIES.   THEY LOVE THEIR COUNTRY.  AND THEY WANT A BETTER FUTURE.  THESE ARE THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND   WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY AND THEY HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN. PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD BUT DON'T   HAVE A VOICE.   I'M RUNNING TO BE THEIR  AND TO BRING PROSPERITY TO EVERY PART OF THIS COUNTRY. TOO MANY OF OUR LEADERS HAVE FORGOTTEN IT IS THEIR DUTY TO PROTECT THE JOBS, WAGES AND WELL-BEING OF AMERICAN WORKERS BEFORE ANY CONSIDERATION. WE HAVE TO DO THAT. I'M NOT RUNNING TO BE THE   PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD.   I'M RUNNING TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.   AND AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL FIGHT FOR EVERY LAST AMERICAN JOB AND EVERY AMERICAN COMPANY, WHICH REALLY A LOT OF COMPANIES IN   THIS ROOM. WE ARE GOING TO BE FIGHTING FOR YOU.  YOU ARE BRINGING THE JOBS. WE ARE A NATION THAT PAVED THE WAY, DUG OUT THE PANAMA CANAL AND WON TWO WORLD WARS AND PUT A MAN ON THE MOON. IT'S TIME TO START THINKING BIG   ONCE AGAIN. THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO ESTABLISH A NATIONAL GOAL OF REACHING 4% ECONOMIC GROWTH.   AND MIGRATE ECONOMISTS DON'T WANT ME TO SAY THIS, BUT I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. THEY'RE UPSET, WILL BE VERY UPSET.  BUT I THINK WE CAN SUBSTANTIAL   BY DO BETTER THAN THAT. IN WORKING WITH MY ECONOMIC TEAM WE HAVE A PLAN TO PUT US ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. THAT UNDER OUR PLAN, THE ECONOMY  WILL AVERAGE 3.5 FRS GROWTH AND CREATE A TOTAL OF 25 MILLION NEW JOBS.   YOU CAN VISIT OUR WEBSITE.  JUST LOOK AT THE MATH. IT WORKS. MR. TRUMP:  THIS GROWTH MEANS   THAT OUR JOBS AND PLANS INCLUDING OUR CHILD CARE REFORM THAT IVANKA TRUMP IS INVOLVED IN -- I LIKE HER, TOO, I AGREE.  WILL BE COMPLETELY PAID FOR IN   COMBINATION WITH PROPOSED   SAVINGS.  IT WILL BE DEFICIT NEUTRAL.   IF WE REACH 4% GROWTH, IT WILL   REDUCE THE DEFICIT. IT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A COMPLETE OVERALL OF OUR TAX   REGULATORY ENERGY AND TRADE   POLICIES.    RIGHT NOW UNDER THE OBAMA-CLINTON POLICIES, THE ECONOMY GREW 1.1% LAST QUARTER,   A NUMBER THAT WAS SHOCKING TO   PEOPLE THAT DO THIS PROFESSIONALLY AND FOR LIFE.  IT TRANSLATES INTO MILLIONS OF   LOST JOBS AND CERTAINLY MILLIONS OF LOST GOOD JOBS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE GOOD JOBS ANYMORE. THOSE JOBS ARE GONE AND GOING. THIS IS THE WEAKEST SO-CALLED RECOVERY SINCE THE GREAT   DEPRESSION. OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS, THE ECONOMY GREW 2.1%, THE SLOWEST   PERIOD, 70 YEARS.   HAD THE ECONOMY GROWN AT THE   SAME RATE AS REAGAN, IT WOULD   HAVE MEANT 10 MILLION MORE JOBS. PERHAPS MOST SHOCKINGLY, MOST MEN AGED 18-34 ARE EITHER IN   JAIL OR OUT OF WORK. TWO MILLION HISPANICS HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE RANKS IN POVERTY. THE OBAMA-CLINTON POLICIES HAVE   DOUBLED THE NATIONAL DEBT.  IT TOOK MORE THAN 130 YEARS FOR THE UNITED STATES TO ACCUMULATE   ITS FIRST $10 TRILLION IN DEBT. IT TOOK PRESIDENT OBAMA LESS   THAN EIGHT YEARS TO ADD ANOTHER  $10 TRILLION.   NOW, IT WILL BE ONE THING IF   THAT MONEY HAD BEEN USED TO   COMPLETELY REBUILD OUR NATION, OUR MILITARY, OUR INFRASTRUCTURE , BUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.   INSTEAD, THE OPPOSITE HAPPENED. WE DOUBLED OUR DEBT AND IN   RETURN, WE HAVE BAD   INFRASTRUCTURE AND SCHOOLS. BADLY DEPLETED MILITARY AND THEY HAVE A BADLY DEPLETED EQUIPMENT,  OLD AND TIRED. AND ANOTHER 14 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT THE WORK FORCE,   NEVER HAS SO MUCH MONEY BEEN   SPENT SO POORLY AND SO UNWISELY.  BUT WE ARE GOING TO TURN THAT   ALL AROUND AND HERE'S HOW. IT BEGINS WITH BOLD NEW TAX REFORM.    DON'T WORRY, THEY ARE GOING UP, NOT DOWN.   THOUGHT YOU WERE CONCERNED, THEY  ARE GOING UP. AS OUTLINED IN DETROIT, OUR TAX   PLAN WILL GREATLY SIMPLIFY THE CODE AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF BRACKETS FROM SEVEN TO THREE.   THE NEW BRACKET WILL BE 12, 25 AND 33%. LOWER INCOME AMERICANS WILL PAY NO INCOME TAX AT ALL.   OUR PLAN WILL REMOVE MILLIONS   AND MILLIONS OF WORKERS FROM THE  INCOME TAX ROLL ENTIRELY SO THAT  ALL OF THAT WORK THAT WE DO IN   WASHINGTON CAN BE DISCONTINUED.   THEY'LL PAY TAX. THEY'LL PAY TAX, BUT PAY TAX   WHEN THEY START MAKING A CERTAIN  AMOUNT OF INCOME. BY LOWERING RATES, STREAMLINING DEDUCTIONS AND SIMPLIFYING THE   PROCESS, WE WILL ADD MILLIONS   AND MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS.   IN ADDITION, BECAUSE WE HAVE   STRONGLY CAPPED DEDUCTIONS FOR   THE WEALTHY AND CLOSED SPECIAL INTEREST LOOPHOLES, THE TAX RELIEF WILL BE CONCENTRATED ON THE WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS TAXPAYER.   THEY WILL RECEIVE THE BIGGEST   BENEFIT AND IT WON'T EVEN BEEN   CLOSE.  THEY HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN.   WE ARE NOT GOING TO FORGET THEM.  THEY HAVE BUILT OUR COUNTRY. WE WILL NOT FORGET. THANK YOU.   THIS IS A WORKING AND  MIDDLE CLASS TAX RELIEF   PROPOSAL. THE TAX RELIEF FOR THESE WORKERS  WILL BE EXPANDED BY MY CHILD   CARE PROPOSALS THAT I HAVE WORKED ON WITH MY DAUGHTER   IVANKA. THESE PROPOSALS ARE CENTRAL AND ARE VERY, VERY POWERFUL CENTRAL ELEMENT OF OUR COMPREHENSIVE TAX  REFORM AND ECONOMIC GROWTH PLAN.  FAMILIES WILL BE ABLE TO FULLY DEDUCT THE AVERAGE COST OF CHILD  CARE FROM THEIR TAXES, INCLUDING  STAY-AT-HOME PARENTS.   BECAUSE THE DEDUCTION IS CAPPED,  IT WILL BE DISPROPORTIONATELY AND IT WILL BENEFIT WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES.  GOT TO TAKE CARE OF OUR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. THE LESS YOU MAKE, THE LARGER   THE SHARE OF YOUR INCOME YOU CAN  EXCLUDE FROM TAXATION.  PARENTS WILL ALSO BE ENROLL A   TAX-FREE DEPENDENT SAVINGS ACCOUNT FOR THEIR CHILDREN OR ELDERLY RELATIVES. LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WILL BENEFIT FROM AN EXPANDED EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT IN THE FORM OF  CHILD CARE REBATES AND MATCHING  $500 CONTRIBUTION FOR THEIR SAVINGS ACCOUNT. A MARRIED COUPLE EARNING $50,000 PER YEAR WITH TWO CHILDREN AND  $8,000 IN CHILD CARE EXPENSES WILL SAVE 35% FROM THEIR CURRENT  TAX BILL.   THAT'S A TREMENDOUS SAVINGS.   AND WILL HAVE A BETTER LIFE. A MARRIED COUPLE EARNING $75,000 PER YEAR WITH TWO CHILDREN AND  $10,000 IN CHILD CARE, EXPENSES   WILL RECEIVE A 30% REDUCTION IN   THEIR TAX BILL FROM WHAT THEY ARE PAYING RIGHT NOW.   SOMEONE EARNING $5 MILLION, LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, WILL RECEIVE VIRTUALLY NO CHANGE IN   THEIR TAX BILL AT ALL. ONE OF OUR GREATEST JOB CREATION MEASURES IS GOING TO BE OUR 15%   BUSINESS TAX RATE, DOWN FROM THE CURRENT 35% RATE, A REDUCTION OF  MORE THAN 40%.   I KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING   FOR.   AN EXPLOSION OF NEW BUSINESSES AND NEW JOBS WILL BE CREATED.  IT WILL BE AMAZING TO WATCH. YOU WATCH AND IT WILL HAPPEN. WE WILL ALSO ALLOW UNITED STATES-BASED MANUFACTURERS TO   FULLY EXPENSE THE COST OF NEW PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT. BIG, BIG DEAL.   ON TOP OF THAT, WE WILL BRING BACK TRILLIONS OF   BUSINESS WEALTH AND THIS IS   WEALTH THAT COSTS OVERSEAS.   NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH IT IS. THEY SAY IT IS $2.5 TRILLION. I HAVE PEOPLE WHO THINK IT'S $5 TRILLION. AND BRING THEM BACK AND TAXED AT  10% AND NOT 35%.  WHO WOULD BRING IT BACK AT 35%?   OBVIOUS NOBODY BECAUSE NOBODY IS  DOING IT.   I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS SO PHENOMENAL, FAR BEYOND WHAT PEOPLE EVEN THING THINK. BY TAXING AT 10% INSTEAD OF 35%, ALL OF THIS MONEY WILL COME BACK INTO OUR COUNTRY AND LOTS OF   GOOD THINGS WILL START TO HAPPEN.   WE WILL TURN AMERICA INTO A NEW MAGNET WITH JOBS AND JOBS IN OUR POOREST COMPANIES. SO IMPORTANT. COMPANIES ARE LEAVING THE COUNTRY BECAUSE TAXES ARE SO HIGH AND COUNTRIES LEAVING THE   COUNTRY TO GET THEIR MONEY.   THAT'S A FIRST.   NO ONE HAS EVER HEARD THAT BEFORE, BUT BELIEVE ME, THAT'S HAPPENED.   NEXT COMES TO REGULATION. NEED TO SCALE BACK YEARS OF DISASTROUS REGULATION UNILATERALLY IMPOSED BY OUT OF CONTROL BUREAUCRATS.  REGULATIONS HAVE GROWN INTO A MASSIVE JOB-KILLING INDUSTRY AND  THE REGULATION INDUSTRY IS ONE BUSINESS I WILL ABSOLUTELY PUT TO AN END DAY ONE.   IN 2015 ALONE, FEDERAL AGENCIES ISSUED OVER   3,300 FINAL RULES AND REGULATIONS UP FROM 2,400 THE   PRIOR YEAR. EVERY YEAR, OVERREGULATION COSTS  OUR ECONOMY $2 TRILLION A YEAR   AND REDUCES HOUSEHOLD WEALTH BY ALMOST $15,000. I PROPOSE A MORATORIUM ON NEW FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT ARE NOT COMPELLED BY CONGRESS OR PUBLIC SAFETY.   AND I WILL ELIMINATE ALL   NEEDLESS AND JOB-KILLING REGULATIONS ON THE BOOKS, AND   THERE ARE PLENTY OF THEM.    THIS INCLUDES ELIMINATING SOME OF OUR MOST INTRUSIVE REGULATIONS LIKE THE WATERS OF THE U.S. RULE AND   MEANS SCRAPPING THE E.P.A. SO-CALLED CLEAN POWER PLAN, WHICH THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF ESTIMATES WILL COST $7.2 BILLION  A YEAR. THIS OBAMA-CLINTON DIRECTIVE WILL SHUT DOWN MOST IF NOT ALL COAL ELECTRICITY PLANTS. ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, THEY ARE SHUTTING DOWN. HILLARY CLINTON SAID SHE WANTS TO SHUT DOWN THE MINERS LIKE SHE  WANTS TO SHUT DOWN THE STEEL MILLS AND WORKERS AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN.    WE ARE GOING TO PUT OUR GREAT MINERS AND STEEL WORKERS BACK TO WORK. ENERGY REFORM IS CENTRAL TO OUR   PLAN AS WELL. ACCORDING TO HERITAGE FOUNDATION, BY 2030, PRESIDENT   OBAMA'S ENERGY RESTRICTIONS WILL  ELIMINATE HALF A MILLION MANUFACTURING JOBS, REDUCE   ECONOMIC OUTPUT BY $2.5 TRILLION AND REDUCE INCOMES BY $7,000 PER PERSON.   AND TODAY, YOU HAVE WORKERS, AND  I SEE THEM ALL THE TIME AND I MEET THEM ALL THE TIME AND THEY   ARE PART OF THIS MASSIVE GROUP   OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE JUST COME ON  TO THIS MOVEMENT. BUT YOU HAVE WORKERS MAKING LESS  MONEY TODAY THAN THEY MADE 18 YEARS AGO IN REAL WAGES. THEY ARE WORKING MUCH HARDER   OFTENTIMES BECAUSE OF THE DISASTROUS OBAMACARE THAT WE ARE  GOING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE.  OFTENTIMES, THEY'RE WORKING TWO JOBS.   SO THEY ARE WORKING HARDER,   THEY'RE OLDER AND THEY'RE MAKING  LESS, LIKE ME. I'M WORKING HARDER THAN I EVER WORKED ALSO.  WHO CARES ABOUT THAT? HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO GO EVEN  FURTHER AND HER PLAN COULD COST   THE ECONOMY $5 TRILLION. A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL LIFT RESTRICTIONS ON ALL SOURCES OF AMERICAN ENERGY PRODUCTION.   ACCORDING TO THE INSTITUTE FOR   AMERICAN ENERGY RESOURCES, THIS   WILL INCREASE THE G.D.P. BY MORE THAN $100 BILLION ANNUALLY.   ADD OVER 500,000 NEW JOBS ANNUALLY.   INCREASE ANNUAL WAGES BY MORE   THAN $30 BILLION OVER THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS. INCREASE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL TAX REVENUES BY ALMOST $6 TRILLION OVER FOUR DECADES. INCREASE TOTAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY  BY MORE THAN $20 TRILLION OVER A  40-YEAR PERIOD. IN ADDITION, WE WILL STREAMLINE   THE PERMITTING PROCESS TO ALL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS   WHICH ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED, INCLUDING THE BILLIONS OF   DOLLARS IN PROJECTS HELD UP BY   PRESIDENT OBAMA CURRENTLY BEING   HELD UP.  THEY JUST WON'T APPROVE ANYTHING. CREATING COUNTLESS MORE JOBS IN   THE PROCESS.  FINALLY COMES TRADE.  THE FOUNDATION FOR EVERYTHING.  AMERICA'S ANNUAL TRADE DEFICIT   WITH THE WORLD IS NOW ALMOST  $800 BILLION A YEAR.  WHO ARE NEGOTIATING THESE DEALS?  WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT OF ALMOST $800 BILLION A YEAR.   THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE SO FAST. BETWEEN WORLD WAR I AND THE YEAR  2000, THE UNITED STATES AVERAGED A 3.5% GROWTH RATE.   BUT AFTER CHINA JOINED THE WORLD  TRADE ORGANIZATION, OUR AVERAGE   GROWTH RATE HAS BEEN REDUCED TO ONLY 2%.  PREDATORY TRADE PRACTICES,   PRODUCT DUMPING, CURRENCY MANIPULATION, WHICH IS A BIG ONE  AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT HAVE TAKEN MILLIONS OF JOBS AND TRILLION OF JOBS IN WEALTH RIGHT  OUT OF OUR COUNTRY.   RIGHT OUT OF OUR COUNTRY.   SO SAD THAT WE ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN. OUR INCOMPETENT POLITICIANS WERE NOT WATCHING.   AND THE ONES THAT WERE WATCHING, WERE TAKEN CARE OF IN SOME FORM,  BECAUSE THIS SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN ALLOWED TO HAVE HAPPENED.  IT IS NO GREAT SECRET THAT MANY   OF THE SPECIAL INTERESTS FUNDING MY OPPONENT'S CAMPAIGN ARE THE   SAME PEOPLE PROFITTING FROM   THESE TERRIBLE TRADE DEALS.   THEY ARE TERRIBLE.  TERRIBLE FOR EVERYBODY.   THE SAME SO-CALLED EXPERTS ADVISING HILLARY CLINTON ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO GAVE US NAFTA.  CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WORLD   TRADE ORGANIZATION, THE JOB-KILLING TRADE DEAL WITH   SOUTH KOREA, ANOTHER DISASTER. AND NOW THE TRANSPACIFIC   PARTNERSHIP THAT THEY ARE   PUSHING SO STRONGLY. THE VERDICT IS IN. ALL OF THE SPECIAL INTERESTS THAT THE MEDIA RACED, WHICH THEY RACED TO GET COMMENT FROM HAVE BEEN PROVEN WRONG OVER SUCH A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.  EVERY SINGLE DEAL THEY PROMOTED, EVERY LIE AND EVERY PRESENT DICK  SHON HAS JUST CRASHED.  THEY HAVE BEEN SO ABSOLUTELY WRONG AND BEEN SO BAD FOR OUR   COUNTRY. OUR MANUFACTURING BASE HAS CRUMBLED. COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN HOLLOWED   OUT.  WAGES HAVE DECLINED.  AND HOUSEHOLDS ARE MAKING LESS   TODAY THAN THEY WERE IN THE YEAR  2000. I PROPOSE A DETAILED PLAN TO   REFORM OUR TRADE POLICY AND BRING VAST NEW JOBS AND WEALTH TO AMERICA.   WE NEED OUR WELFARE. WE DON'T HAVE WEALTH.   A FOREIGN COUNTRY IS USING TO HARM OUR COUNTRY TO HARM OUR   WORKERS AND OUR COUNTRY IS BEING  HARMED.   I WILL USE EVERY TOOL TO END THESE ABUSES AND I WILL USE OUR GREATER LEADERS AND FINEST   NEGOTIATORS AND I WILL TELL YOU SOME OF THEM ARE IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW.  NOT ALL OF THEM, BUT SOME.  I KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND WE ARE   GOING TO BE CALLING ON YOU BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE NEGOTIATING THE BIGGEST DEALS IN THE WORLD, FAR BIGGER THAN YOUR COMPANY DEALS. TAKE SOME OF THESE BIG COMPANIES AND LOOK AT SOME OF THESE TRADE   DEALS, HATE TO SAY IT BUT COMPANIES ARE PEANUTS.  BUT WE ARE GOING TO USE OUR   BEST. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE POLITICAL   HACKS NEGOTIATING THE BIGGEST IMPORTANT DEALS IN THE WORLD.   WE ARE GOING TO START WITH   NAFTA, WHICH IS CAUSING SO MUCH   DAMAGE TO OUR COUNTRY. WE WILL ENTIRELY RENEGOTIATE NAFTA INTO A DEAL THAT WILL   EITHER BE A GOOD ONE FOR US AS A  COUNTRY AND OUR WORKERS, OR WE   WILL TERMINATE IT UNTIL A BRAND NEW AND PRODUCTIVE DEAL CAN BE   SIGNED.   WE'LL KEEP AMERICA OUT OF TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP UNLESS WE CAN DO SOMETHING THAT IS PHENOMENAL AND I'M NOT SEEING IT  RIGHT NOW. I CAN TELL YOU THAT. I'M NOT SEEING IT.   NEXT I'M GOING TOLL INSTRUCT MY TREASURY SECRETARY TO LABEL CHINA -- I LIKE CHINA,   THEY ARE MY TENANT AND BUY CONDOS ALL THE TIME.  THEY'RE JUST FINE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY ARE A CURRENCY MANIPULATOR AND WE ARE GOING TO APPLY TARIFFS TO ANY COUNTRY THAT DEVALUES ITS CURRENCY TO GAIN AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OVER THE UNITED STATES.   THEY ARE A MANIPULATOR, GRAND   MASTER LEVEL.   WE CAN'T ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN AND HOW PEOPLE AND OUR REPRESENTATIVES AND POLITICIANS DON'T EVEN HAVE A LITTLE CLUE HOW TO PLAY THE GAME. WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT THIS YEAR WITH CHINA OF APPROXIMATELY $500 BILLION.   WHAT KIND OF A DEAL IS THAT?  AND THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS. $200 BILLION, $300 BILLION, $400 BILLION FOR YEARS.  I'M GOING TO INSTRUCT THE UNITED  STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE TO   BRING TRADE CASES AGAINST CHINA. CHINA'S UNFAIR SUBSIDY BEHAVIOR IS PROHIBITED BY THE TERMS OF   ITS ENTRANCE INTO THE W.T.O.  AND I INTEND TO ENFORCE THE RULES.  AND I'M SURE WE'LL MAKE A DEAL   SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY.  BUT THEY'RE NOT PLAYING FAIRLY   AND OUR POLITICIANS DON'T   UNDERSTAND HOW TO PLAY THE GAME.   IF CHINA DOES NOT STOP ITS ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES INCLUDING THEFT OF AMERICAN   TRADE SECRETS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES, I WILL APPLY COUNTERVAILING DUTIES UNTIL CHINA CEASES AND DESISTS.   YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? A SINGLE ACTION OF WOE ADD MILLIONS.   ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION, IMPROVED PROTECTION OF AMERICA'S -- JUST   THINK OF THIS, IMPROVE   PROTECTION OF AMERICA'S   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN CHINA   WOULD ADD TWO MILLION JOBS A YEAR WITHIN THE UNITED STATES   IFFER SINGLE YEAR.  AND WE DO NOTHING.  WE ALLOW THEM TO GET AWAY WITH IT.   WHO CAN BLAME THEM?   IF YOU CAN BLAME AWAY WITH IT,   THEY ARE GOING TO GET AWAY WITH   IT.   WE ARE GOING TO STOP THE OUTFLOW OF JOBS FROM OUR COUNTRY AND OPEN A NEW HIGHWAY OF JOBS BACK INTO OUR COUNTRY.   HERE'S HOW THE PLAN ADDS UP.  WE ARE PROPOSING A 4.4 TRILLION   TAX CUT THAT WILL SCORE AS A  $2.6 TRILLION UNDER DYNAMIC GROWTH MODELS, WHICH IS HOW   TAXES SHOULD BE SCORED.    THIS INCLUDES THE   CHILD CARE PLAN THAT WE   ANNOUNCED THE OTHER DAY.  OUR ECONOMIC TEAM HAS FURTHER   MODELED THAT THE GROWTH INDUCED   BASED FROM TRADE, ENERGY AND REGULATION REFORM WILL SHAVE ANOTHER $1.8 TRILLION OFF OF THE REMAINING DEBT. THAT LEAVES AROUND $800 BILLION.  THIS MONEY CAN ALL BE SAVED THROUGH SIMPLE, COMMONSENSE REFORMS.  IF WE JUST SAVE ONE PENNY OF EACH FEDERAL DOLLAR SPENT ON NONDEFENSE AND NONENTITLEMENT   PROGRAMS, WE COULD SAVE ALMOST  $1 TRILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE.   ONE PENNY.  WE CAN ALL DO THAT.    SAVE OVER A TRILLION. AGAIN THIS IS SPENDING THAT DOES  NOT TOUCH DEFENSE, BECAUSE WE   HAVE TO BUILDUP OUR MILITARY,   WHICH IS SO TERRIBLY DEPLETED   AND THAT DOES NOT TOUCH ENTITLEMENTS.   IF OUR PLAN EXCEEDS THE $3.5% 10-YEAR GROWTH AVERAGE THAT OUR   JOBS PROPOSED WILL ACTUALLY   REDUCE AND START REALLY STRONGLY  REDUCING THE DEFICIT. SAVINGS WILL BE COMPOUNDED BY   THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING UNEMPLOYMENT OR WELFARE WILL FINALLY BE ABLE   TO FIND JOBS. THIS IS THE MOST PRO-GROWTH, PRO--JOBS, PRO-FAMILIES' PLAN.  THIS IS WHAT OUR NEW FUTURE WILL LOOK LIKE. I'M GOING TO LOWER YOUR TAXES.  I'M GOING TO GET RID OF MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF UNNECESSARY REGULATION.   ALL OF THESE REGULATIONS ON YOUR  BUSINESS AND IN YOUR LIFE.  I'M GOING TO UNLEASH AMERICA'S   ENERGY.   I'M GOING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE. I'M GOING TO APPOINT JUSTICES OF  THE SUPREME COURT WHO WILL FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION.   I'M GOING TO REBUILD OUR DEPLETED MILITARY AND TAKE   CARE OF OUR VETS WHO ARE TREATED  SO BADLY.    IN MANY CASES, OUR VETS ARE TREATED NOT NEARLY AS WELL AS PEOPLE WHO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.  WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.   I'M GOING TO SAVE YOUR SECOND   AMENDMENT, WHICH IS UNDER SIEGE.  I'M GOING TO STOP ILLEGAL   IMMIGRATION AND DRUGS FROM   POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY AND TOTALLY POISONING OUR YOUTH AND  AND YES, WE WILL   BUILD THE WALL.   THE WALL WILL BE BUILT.   AND JUST IN CASE YOU ARE WORRIED  WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT,   MEXICO WILL PAY FOR IT.   TOTALLY SERIOUS ABOUT IT.   MEXICO WILL PAY FOR IT.   MEXICO, WE LOOK AT THE TRADE   DEFICIT WE HAVE WITH MEXICO, IT'S MASSIVE. THE WALL IS PEANUTS COMPARED TO WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.  MEXICO WILL PAY FOR THE WALL.   AND I'M GOING TO RENEGOTIATE OUR  DISASTROUS TRADE DEALS ESPECIALLY NAFTA AND MAKE GREAT   TRADE DEALS THAT PUT THE AMERICAN WORKER FIRST AND PUT   THE AMERICAN WORKER BACK TO   WORK.    THAT INCLUDES OUR MINERS AND OUR STEEL WORKERS.   THEY ARE GOING BACK TO WORK. WE WILL REBUILD OUR ROADS, OUR   BRIDGES, OUR TUNNELS, OUR HIGHWAYS, AIRPORTS, SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS.  WE'LL REBUILD EVERYTHING. AMERICAN CARS WILL TRAVEL THE   WORLD. AMERICAN PLANES WILL SORE THE   SKIES. AND AMERICAN SHIPS WILL PATROL THE SEAS. AMERICAN STEEL WILL SEND NEW SKYSCRAPERS INTO THE CLOUDS. AMERICAN HANDS WILL REBUILD THIS NATION. AND AMERICA'S ENERGY HARVESTED FROM AMERICAN SOURCES WILL POWER THIS NATION. AMERICAN WORKERS WILL BE HIRED TO DO THE JOBS. WE WILL PUT NEW AMERICAN METAL AND NEW AMERICAN STEEL INTO THE SPINE OF THIS COUNTRY.  JOBS WILL RETURN. INCOMES WILL RISE. NEW FACTORIES WILL COME RUSHING   BACK TO OUR SHORES. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN.  WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG   AGAIN. AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT   AGAIN.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOD BLESS YOU.  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU VERY  THANK YOU.      BIG DIFFERENCE.  I THINK THAT -- I WATCH THE WORLD AND I LOOK AT CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES. AND IF CHINA GOES DOWN TO 7% OR 8%, IT'S LIKE THEY WILL HAVE A REVOLUTION.   AND WHAT DO THEY DO, THEY START DEVALUING AND DO ALL SORTS OF   THINGS AND GET IT BACK ON TRACK   ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. AND I HAD FRIENDS COME DO ME WHO  HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED. GREAT MANUFACTURERS, VERY   SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE, BUT THEY BECOME LESS AND LESS SUCCESSFUL   BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BEAT THE SYSTEM.   AND THEY ARE ALMOST DOING WELL AND THEN THERE IS A MASSIVE   DEVALUATION IN CHINA OR OTHER   COUNTRIES AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER COUNTRIES OUT THERE AND  ACTUALLY HURTING CHINA NOW.   THEY HAVE 7%. AND YOU SEE IT, AND DROPPING TO   7%, 8%, THEY CONSIDER IT TO BE A DISASTER AND WE ARE STUCK AT 1%.  THE REAL NUMBER IS 1%, BUT NO   MORE THAN 2% AND WE TRY TO LEARN TO LIVE WITH IT. WE CAN'T DO IT NIME.  WE ARE GOING TO -- WE CAN'T DO   IT ANYMORE.   WE ARE BRINGING BACK TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT DOESN'T COME   INTO THIS COUNTRY. THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF COMPANIES THAT LEAVE. NOT BECAUSE TAXES ARE TOO HIGH   BUT LEAVE TO GET THEIR MONEY.   WE ARE GOING TO UNLEASH A LOT   WITH THE REGULATIONS.   THE THING THAT MOST SURPRISED ME  IN GOING AROUND, BECAUSE -- I   HAVE BEEN EVERYWHERE. THIS STARTED ON JUNE 16.  WHO KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO   HAPPEN, RIGHT? BUT IT STARTED ON JUNE 16 AND IT  HAS BEEN AN AMAZING THING.  WHAT HAS AMAZED ME, I SPEAK TO BIG BUSINESSES, THE BIGGEST BUSINESSES IN THE WORLD AND I   ALSO SPEAK TO THE SMALL BUSINESS  PEOPLE AND THE FARMERS. IF THEY HAD THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN  THIS MASSIVE TAX CUT FROM 35% TO  15% OR REGULATION RELIEF, THEY   WOULD TAKE 100% -- THE REGULATIONS ARE A DISASTER.   THEY ARE KILLING THE FARMERS.   THEY ARE KILLING THE ENERGY FOLKS.  THEY KILLED THE MINES.  AND WE ALL BELIEVE THERE HAS TO   BE REGULATION FOR SAFETY,   ENVIRONMENT. BUT IT HAS GONE SO CRAZY AND GOTTEN SO EXCESSIVE THAT THEY   WOULD TAKE THAT OVER TAXES.   WE ARE GOING TO UNLEASH A NUMBER  OF JOBS COMING IN AND GOING TO HAVE CUTTING OF WASTE, FRAUD AND  ABUSE. IF THE PENNY PLAN, JUST A PENNY   OUT OF EVERY DOLLAR.  I KNOW YOU CAN DO THAT.   BUT WE HAVE TO APPOINT PEOPLE TO  HEAD THESE MASSIVE AGENCIES. IF THEY WERE COMPANIES, THEY WOULD BE VERY LARGE COMPANIES AND SOME WOULD BE BIGGER THAN   ANY OTHER COMPANIES.  BUT YOU YOU TAKE A PENNY, A   PENNY OFF THE DOLLAR AND DO THAT  FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, GREAT THINGS START TO   HAPPEN. IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE SPEND A   TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MILITARY, WHICH WE ARE GOING TO INCREASE.   BUT WE ALSO DEFEND OTHER COUNTRIES.  AND THOSE COUNTRIES ARE NOT   PAYING US NEARLY WHAT THEY   SHOULD BE PAYING US.  WE ARE LOSING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON DEFENDING OWE AND MANY OF THEM DON'T PAY   US.   IF THEY DON'T PAY US, I SAY WHY? THEY DON'T ASK. SO THOSE COUNTRIES I'M SURE WILL START TO PAY FOR THE DEFENSE, BUT IT'S A FANTASTIC NUMBER. IT'S A VERY, VERY LARGE -- IT'S A SHOCKING NUMBER.  I WILL JUST FINISH WITH THIS. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR JAPAN, BUT WE DEFEND JAPAN, GERMANY, SAUDI ARABIA, SOUTH KOREA, 28,000 SOLDIERS RIGHT NOW IN SOUTH KOREA.  THESE ARE WEALTHY COUNTRIES.  AND WHEN I SAY THEY HAVE TO PAY MORE, A GENERAL CAME TO REFUTE MY STATEMENT AND SAID, DOESN'T MR. TRUMP KNOW THAT JAPAN PAYS 50% OF THE COST OF ITS DEFENSE?   AND I SAID, WHY DON'T THEY PAY   100%?   THE NUMBERS YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE MASSIVE. AND WHEN YOU ADD IT ALL TOGETHER, A LOT OF GOOD THINGS   ARE GOING TO HAPPEN.   NO.  THERE ARE SOME AREAS WHERE YOU   COULD BUY BACK DEBT. I SAID BUY BACK DEBT. THIS ISN'T LIKE BUILDING A REAL ESTATE PROJECT AND THE MARKET   CRASHES AND YOU HAVE A SHOT AT A  BANK.   I LOVED THOSE DAYS.   SOMEONE SAID I'M ONE OF THE   GREAT IN THE WORLD.   I LOVE BUYING DEBT AND NEGOTIATING DEBT.   WITH THE UNITED STATES YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING BEYOND   THE GOLD STANDARD.  THE ANSWER IS NO. BUT YOU CAN BUY BACK.   WE ARE NOT TALKING DISCOUNTS.   YOU CAN DISCOUNT AND DO THINGS. THE DEBT OF THIS COUNTRY IS ABSOLUTELY SACRED. ABSOLUTELY 100% SACRED.    I GO BACK TO THE HEADS OF THE VARIOUS GROUPS, AGENCIES, ALL OF THE PARCELS OF   GOVERNMENT AND I WOULD BE PUTTING VERY, VERY TOP PEOPLE INTO NEGOTIATE. WE PUT POLITICAL PEOPLE IN TO   NEGOTIATE AND PEOPLE WHO GAVE CONTRIBUTIONS, WE PUT PEOPLE   THAT WORK THE SYSTEM. WE PUT PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T BE   THERE. AND WHEN YOU SAY CAN YOU CUT 1%   OFF YOUR BUDGET AND THEY SAY THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.  A KNOW SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN   THIS ROOM ARE TOTAL KILLERS.  THEY SAID I CAN GET IT DOWN 25%   IN ONE YEAR, MAYBE MORE.  I SAID TAKE IT EASY, RELAX.   THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM   WHO WOULD SAY THAT.   1% A YEAR FOR 10 YEARS, IT'S A   MASSIVE DIFFERENCE.   1% A YEAR FOR 10 YEARS.   SO I WOULD REALLY HAVE IT DONE   AT THE LEVEL OF THE GROUP RUNNING WHATEVER INDIVIDUAL   THING WITHIN GOVERNMENT THEY ARE  RUNNING AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE   TO DO IF WE HAVE THE RIGHT   PEOPLE. WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE   DOING WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THEY HAVE PEOPLE UNDER THEM THAT  ARE FAR, FAR MORE COMPETENT THAN  THEY ARE. AND THOSE PEOPLE LOSE RESPECT   FOR THE SYSTEM WHEN THEY SEE WHAT'S COMING. AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW STRONGLY I BELIEVE THIS AND THE   TRADE DEALS ARE SO BAD. NAFTA HAS DESTROYED OUR COUNTRY. NAFTA HAS DESTROYED THE   MANUFACTURING LEG OF OUR COUNTRY.  LOOK IN UPSTATE NEW YORK AND LOST 40% OF THEIR MANUFACTURING   AND GOING TO LOSE A LOT MORE.   HILLARY CLINTON SAID SHE WAS GOING TO BRING JOBS BACK TO NEW YORK.   UPSTATE NEW YORK, LONG ISLAND, YOU LOOK AT THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING.  BUILDING AFTER BUILDING IS EMPTY.  THEY ALL LEFT. SO WHEN WE NEGOTIATE GREAT TRADE  DEALS -- AND WE AREN'T INCLUDING  THAT TO A LARGE EXTENT IN THE   NUMBERS WE ARE GIVING YOU.  WHEN YOU TAKE NAFTA AND MAKE IT A TWO-LANE HIGHWAY AND NOT ONE   LANE, WE HAVE A LOT OF CATCHING   UP TO DO.   THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY STRIPPED THIS COUNTRY OF ITS   MANUFACTURING JOBS AND JOBS. AND COMPANIES THAT DESTROYED COMPANIES. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF COMPANIES.  MILLIONS OF JOBS, WE ARE GOING TO GET THAT BACK. WE ARE GOING TO GET THAT BACK. WHEN I TALK ABOUT TAX CUTTING AND BALANCING, A BIG PART OF IT   IS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE GREAT TRADE DEALS.  I THINK THIS MAN WILL BE IN   CHARGE OF CHINA.  WE WILL DO VERY WELL. BUT SERIOUSLY, WE HAVE THE   GREATEST NEGOTIATORS IN THE WORLD. WHEN CHINA ENTERS THAT NEGOTIATION, THEY COME IN WITH 20 PEOPLE THAT ARE THE TOUGHEST,  SMARTEST, MEANEST, THEY DON'T   SAY GOOD MORNING, ISN'T IT A   LOVELY DAY? HOW DID THE YANKEES DO LAST NIGHT?  THERE'S NO TALK.  WE GET DOWN TO BUSINESS, BOOM. NO GAMES.   WE PUT PEOPLE IN THERE WHO DON'T  KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING BECAUSE  THIS IS WHY WE HAVE DEFICITS OF  $500 BILLION WITH ONE COUNTRY.  WE BUILT CHINA.   AND I SAY THAT WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR CHINA.  THEY -- I HAVE MANY FRIENDS FROM  CHINA.  THE BIGGEST PEOPLE, THE RICHEST   PEOPLE, THEY CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT  CHINA GETS AWAY WITH.   AND WHEN I ANNOUNCED I WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, WELL, I   DIDN'T MEAN THAT. THEY DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS GOING   TO HAPPEN.  BUT IN THE GOOD OLE DAYS, THEY WOULD SAY WE DON'T BELIEVE.   YOUR GOVERNMENT IS STUPID AND   NOW THEY DENY THEY EVER SAID   THAT.    TRACK RECORD, GREAT COMPETENCE, LOVE OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING, HOW THEY'RE GETTING ALONG WITH PEOPLE, REFERENCES. NO DIFFERENT WHEN YOU ARE OWNING A COMPANY, HOW YOU HIRE TOP PEOPLE. PEOPLE WITH HEART ALSO IS   PROBABLY THE ONE THING YOU NEED IN GOVERNMENT. THERE'S SOME THERE, BUT NOT A LOT. BUT YOU NEED PEOPLE THAT ARE TRULY, TRULY CAPABLE AND YOU NEED -- AND I THINK SO MUCH HAS TO DO WITH PAST HISTORY, HOW IS   IT DONE, HOW IS IT WORKED OUT.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT PERHAPS BETTER THAN ANYBODY.  AND WE HAVE TO GET THE BEST PEOPLE.   WE CAN NO LONGER BE SO   POLITICALLY CORRECT.  WE DO THINGS TODAY, PEOPLE ARE   AFRAID TO WALK, AFRAID TO TALK.   THEY CAN'T SPEAK.   THEY AFRAID THEY ARE GOING TO   SAY A WRONG WORD AND SHUNNED FROM SOCIETY.   THAT ONLY LASTS FOR A WEEK IF THAT HAPPENS. BUT WE HAVE TO STOP BEING POLITICALLY CORRECT.  WE NEED TO GET THE BEST AND   FINEST AND IF WE DON'T, WE WILL   BE IN TROUBLE FOR A LONG PERIOD   OF TIME AND MAYBE NEVER COME OUT OF IT. I'M NOT SAYING IT BECAUSE IT'S   MYSELF, THIS IS GOING TO BE THE LAST ELECTION WE HAVE A CHANCE   TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN, MAKE IT WEALTHY AND   STRONG AGAIN.   MAKE IT ALL OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO SEE.  BUT I BELIEVE THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION THAT WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN FOR MANY, MANY, MANY YEARS. MANY DECADES, BECAUSE IT'S GOING DOWN.   THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT BEFORE, IF THEY  PUT CERTAIN PEOPLE ONTO THE SUPREME COURT, OUR COUNTRY IS   GOING TO BE A WHOLE DIFFERENT COUNTRY. LARGE-SCALE VERSION OF VENEZUELA, A TOTALLY DIFFERENT   DEAL. AND THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE THAT  IN MY OPINION OUR COUNTRY HAS TO REALLY GET BETTER, TO GET WELL. AND I JUST THINK THIS ELECTION   IS SO IMPORTANT, NOT BECAUSE OF   ME, BUT BECAUSE THE IDEAS, THE   IDEAS THAT WE HAVE, THE IDEAS   THAT WE NEED TO DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.  BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A   VERY, VERY IMPORTANT ELECTION   AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE SEEING SUCH ENTHUSIASM. WE HAVE PEOPLE SHOWING UP,   25,000 PEOPLE SHOW UP AND 30,000 PEOPLE.    WE ANNOUNCED ONE DAY, WE HAD ONE IN THE PENSACOLA THE OTHER DAY, WE HAD TENS OF   THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT SHOWED UP A DAY AND-A-HALF BEFORE THE   SPEECH ON TWITTER. PEOPLE WANT TO SEE GREAT THINGS HAPPEN TO THIS COUNTRY. PEOPLE REALLY LOVE THIS COUNTRY. THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY REALLY LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND OTHER COUNTRIES WANT TO SEE   GREAT THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S  SO IMPORTANT.   I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION WE HAVE   HAD FOR MANY, MANY DECADES AND   I'M NOT SURE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A SECOND CHANCE AT IT.    I THINK H AND R BLOCK  WOULD BE A DISASTER. HOW ABOUT PEOPLE -- IT'S SO COMPLICATED.  AND PEOPLE THAT FRANKLY ARE MAKING A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY.   THEY HAVE TO GO AND HAVE THEIR   TAX RETURNS DONE BY PEOPLE.   AND BY THE WAY, WHEN THEY'RE DONE, YOU'LL HAVE 10 DIFFERENT   TAX PEOPLE.   THE WHOLE THING IS CRAZY. SO THAT WOULD BE ONE INDUSTRY THAT WOULDN'T DO WELL. I CAN TELL YOU AN INDUSTRY THAT   WILL DO WELL AND INDUSTRY WE CAN  USE AND PRICES ARE LOW NOW. BUT WHEN PRICES GO UP IS THE   ENERGY INDUSTRY. WE HAVE AMAZING PEOPLE IN THAT INDUSTRY AND THEY ARE BEING DECIMATED. THEY ARE BEING ABSOLUTELY DECIMATED.  AND ENERGY IS SO IMPORTANT. AND WE FOUND OUT BECAUSE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY, WHETHER FRACKING AND  MANY OTHER THINGS. WE HAVE MORE THAN JUST ABOUT   ANYBODY IN THE WORLD. OUR LAND IS SO VALUABLE BECAUSE   OF WHAT IS UNDERNEATH IT. WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AND   ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND.  THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.  IT'S INCREDIBLE WHEN YOU LOOK AT  WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS, WE CAN BE SELF-SUFFICIENT  OTHERWISE WE WILL BE STUCK IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  WE HAVE TO KNOCK OUT ISIS.  I DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN THAT WAR,  BUT I WASN'T A POLITICIAN AND   NOBODY CARED. I DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN THE WAR.   THE WAY THEY GOT OUT WAS BAD, SO  QUICKLY. ISIS DEVELOPED.   WE HAVE TO KNOCK OUT ISIS. YOU SEE THE ATROCITIES. YESTERDAY, 22 PEOPLE WERE HUNG FROM RACKS IN A SLAUGHTER HOUSE AND THEN THROATS CUT.   CAN YOU IMAGINE, NOBODY HAS   HEARD OF THINGS LIKE THIS BEFORE  AND WE TALK ABOUT WATERBOARD HING.   IT'S AN INCREDIBLE THING. NOT PLAYING ON THE SAME PLAYING FIELD.  IF YOU LOOK AT THE ATROCITIES, JUST YESTERDAY WITH THE MEAT   HOOKS, WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TOTALLY DECIMATE ISIS.  WE HAVE TO DO IT AND DO IT   RAPIDLY. WE HAVE NO CHOICE.   AND WE HAVE TO GET TO REBUILDING OUR COUNTRY AND REBUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND   REBUILD OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE IT'S A MESS.  LOWER INTEREST RATES, OF COURSE.  YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THEM UNTIL  JANUARY 1, BECAUSE OBAMA WANTS TO GO AND PLAY GOLF AND WANTS TO  LEAVE AND NO STOCK MARKET   DISRUPTION.   AND I SAID, I THINK THE FED IS BEING TOTALLY CONTROLLED   POLITICALLY AND NOT RAISING   RATES AND BEING CONTROLLED   POLITICALLY. I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BELOW   UNTIL -- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A RAISE.  BUT THEY WILL BE LOW TO THE END   OF THE YEAR.  SHOULDN'T BE DISCUSSING IT.   I JUST THINK IT'S A TERRIBLE   THING THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE   WE ARE DOING IT FOR POLITICAL -- I BELIEVE THE FED IS VERY POLITICAL AND HAS BECOME VERY   POLITICAL, LIKE MANY OTHER GROUPS IN THIS COUNTRY. BEYOND ANYTHING I WOULD HAVE EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE. SO I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE  LOW INTEREST RATES UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR. MAYBE NO INTEREST AT ALL.   AND THE MARKET WILL STAY ARTIFICIALLY HIGH AND THEN HAVE   TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT. THEY ARE NOT DOING THE RIGHT JOB.  WITH ALL OF THAT BEING SAID, ALL  MY LIFE I LIKED LOW INTEREST RATES.  BECAUSE I'M DOING THIS, I CAN'T   TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. BUT THAT'S OK. I WILL SAY IT'S BECOME IN MY   OPINION, THE FED HAS BECOME EXTREMELY POLITICAL.

IT IS MY PLEASURE. >> THANK YOU, EVERYONE. WE ARE A GROUP OF NATIONAL SECURITY PROFESSIONALS WHO HAVE  DEDICATED OUR LIVES TO THE  SECURITY OF OUR NATION AS DEPLORABLE AS WE ARE.  WE ARE NOT A POLITICAL GROUP. WE ARE A NATIONAL SECURITY GROUP  HAS CHOSEN TO SUPPORT A  POLITICAL CANDIDATES. THE SERIES OF DISCUSSIONS YOU  HAVE ALL LISTENS TO MR. TRUMP HAVE DEAL WITH NATIONAL SECURITY .  NATIONAL SECURITY IS NOT SOLELY  ABOUT THE MILITARY.  IT IS COMPRISED OF MANY FACETS, DEFENSE, DIPLOMACY, DEVELOPMENT, ECONOMIC SECURITY, ENERGY SECURITY, BORDER SECURITY, CYBER SECURITY, HOMELAND SECURITY. THE LOGICAL -- THE LOGICAL POLICY PRESENTATIONS  THAT MR. TRUMP HAS DELIVERED  OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS LAY OUT A SOUND STRATEGIC APPROACH TO PROVIDING THE SECURITY OF THE NATION AND THE SECURITY OF ALL AMERICANS. THESE POLICIES COMPRISE A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE COMPLEX FACETS OF NATIONAL SECURITY IN A COMPLEX AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS INTERNATIONAL WORLD. MOREOVER, MR. TRUMP COMBINES THIS MULTIFACETED APPROACH TO OUR SECURITY WITH A PRONOUNCED  COMMITTED TO THOSE IN UNIFORM  SERVING OUR NATION TODAY.  AND IN FACT, ALL VETERANS WHO  HAVE WORN THE CLOTH OF THE  NATION. AND THAT COMMITMENT EXTENDS TO  THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO HAVE  SERVED. FOR AS ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM  KNOW, THEIR SACRIFICE HAS BEEN DESPERATE -- HAS BEEN EQUALLY DIFFICULT. GEORGE WASHINGTON SAID WITH  WHICH OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE  LIKELY TO SERVE IN ANY WAR, NO  MATTER HOW JUSTIFIED, SHALL BE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO HOW THE  PERCEIVED VETERANS OF EARLIER  WARS WERE TREATED AND ARE APPRECIATED BY OUR NATION. MR. TRUMP HAS EMBRACED THOSE WORDS OF OUR FIRST PRESIDENT. MR. TRUMP HAS ALSO SHOWN AN EXTREME DEDICATION TO THOSE THAT HAVE SHOULDERED THE WOUNDS OF BATTLE IN THE SERVICE TO OUR NATION, AND WE HAVE SEVERAL OF  THOSE PEOPLE WITH US TODAY.  AND HE HAS COMMITTED HIMSELF TO  THE WORDS OF PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN, WORDS THAT ARE  EMBLAZONED IN THE MOTTO OF OUR  DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS -- TO CARE FOR HIM WHO SHALL  HAVE BORNE THE BATTLE AND FOR HIS WIDOW AND ORPHAN. THIS IS WHY ALL OF US HERE ARE ASSEMBLED TO SUPPORT DONALD  TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT. WE HAVE -- WE HAVE LIVED NATIONAL SECURITY  FOR A LARGE PART OF OUR LIVES. WE UNDERSTAND HOW A STRONG ECONOMY, COOPERATIVE GOVERNANCE, COMBINED WITH SKILLED DIPLOMACY,  SOUND ENERGY POLICY, FOUND ALLIANCES, AND A UNITED AMERICAN PUBLIC ALL DEFENDED BY A WELL-TRADE, APPROPRIATELY FUNDED, FULLY COMMITTED, AND  TECHNOLOGICALLY UNSURPASSED MILITARY COME TOGETHER TO MAKE AMERICA STRONG AND MAKE THE  WORLD A SAFER PLACE. AND, FINALLY, FINALLY, ALL OF US ON THIS STAGE, ALL OF YOU IN THE  AUDIENCE WHO HAVE SERVED, YOU  TOOK A NOSE, YOU PLEDGED --AN OATH, YOU PLANTS, SEALED WITH YOUR HONOR AND COMMITMENT TO YOUR LIVES, NOT SOLELY TO THE COUNTRY, NOT TO A FLAT, NOT TO A CHAIN OF COMMAND, NOT TO A COMMANDER IN CHIEF, BUT AN OATH  TO A PIECE OF PAPER, A PIECE OF PARCHMENT UPON WHICH IS WRITTEN  THOSE IDEALS IN WHICH WE  BELIEVE, THOSE VALUES THAT  DEFINE US AS A NATION, IS VERY VIRTUES THAT THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED BEFORE US DEFENDED WITH THEIR LIVES. AN OATH TO DEFEND THE  CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED  STATES FROM ALL ENEMIES, FOREIGN  AND DOMESTIC AND BEAR TRUE FAITH  AND ALLEGIANCE THAT CONSTITUTION, TO FORM A MORE  PERFECT UNION, TO ESTABLISH JUSTICE, TO ENSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY, PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE, PROMOTE THE GENERAL WELFARE, AND TO SECURE  THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY TO  OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY. THAT OA IS IMPORTANT TO USTH WHO -- THAT OATH IS IMPORTANT TO  US HERE TODAY. THAT OATH REMAINS THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR LIVES LONG  AFTER WE HAVE TAKEN OFF THE  UNIFORM. THAT OATH IS IMPORTANT TO DONALD  TRUMP, AND HE WILL TAKE THAT  VERY SAME OATH ON JANUARY 20,  2017. THAT IS WHY WE ASSEMBLED IN THIS ROOM, ALONG WITH MANY OTHER VETERANS AND THEIR MILITARY FAMILIES, ALL SUPPORT HIS CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AMERICA. TOGETHER WE WILL ALL MAKE  AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

THANK YOU. WOW. A LOT OF PEOPLE.   WOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. I LOVE NORTH CAROLINA. WE'LL HAVE A BIG VICTORY IN NORTH CAROLINA. IN 56 DAYS, WE ARE GOING TO WIN  THIS STATE, AND WE ARE GOING TO  WIN BACK THE WHITE HOUSE.   AND BY THE WAY, WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE  TRYING TO GET IN.  WOULD ANYBODY LIKE TO GIVE UP  THEIR PLACE? ANYBODY? NO. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.  IT IS A GREAT HONOR. TO WIN BACK THE WHITE HOUSE, HOWEVER, YOU MUST GET OUT AND VOTE. AND REMEMBER THAT THIS MEANS EARLY VOTING, WHICH BEGINS ON OCTOBER 20. YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND VOTE ON  THE EIGHTH, OR ONLY -- ON  NOVEMBER 8, OR EARLY VOTING STARTING ON OCTOBER 20.  THIS IS OUR CHANCE -- IN MY YOU  AND IT IS OUR LAST CHANCE, I  REALLY BELIEVE THAT. OUR LAST CHANCE TO TAKE IT BACK, TO FIX OUR RIGGED SYSTEM, AND TO CREATE PROSPERITY FOR EACH AND  EVERY AMERICAN. IT IS OUR LAST CHANCE, FOLKS.  THIS IS IT. AFTER THAT, WE HAVE A WHOLE NEW,  DIFFERENT COUNTRY, AND YOU'RE  NOT GOING TO LIKE IT VERY MUCH. THIS STANDS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO  MY OPPONENTS CAMPAIGN OF HATE. HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN RUNNING  A HATE FILLED AND NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN, WITH NO POLICY, NO SOLUTIONS, AND NO NEW IDEAS. BY CONTRAST, I HAVE BEEN GOING  AROUND THE COUNTRY OFFERING VERY  DETAILED PLANS FOR REFORM AND CHANGE. ALL OF THESE REFORM PLANS ARE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE, AND  THEY ARE EXTENSIVE. WE HAVE NO CHOICE.   SO MY OPPONENTS  SLANDERS YOU AS DEPLORABLE AND IRREDEEMABLE. I CALL YOU HARD-WORKING AMERICAN PATRIOTS LOVE YOUR COUNTRY AND  WANT A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL OUR PEOPLE PEOPLE -- OUR PEOPLE.   YOUR MOTHERS AND FATHERS, SOLDIERS AND SAILORS,  CARPENTERS AND WELDERS.  YOU ARE LAWYERS. YOU ARE VERY RICH PEOPLE IN SOME  CASES. YOU ARE THE TOP OF THEIR CLASS, YOU ARE THE TOP OF YOUR  UNIVERSITY, YOU ARE PROFESSORS. YOU ARE EVERYBODY. YOU ARE EVERYBODY. YOU ARE DEMOCRATS, YOUR  INDEPENDENCE, YOU ARE  REPUBLICANS.  ABOVE ALL ELSE, YOU ARE AMERICANS, AND YOU ARE ENTITLED --   AND YOU ARE ENTITLED  TO LEADERSHIP THAT HONORS YOU,  CHERISHES YOU, AND TOTALLY  DEPENDS YOU, AND THAT IS WHAT  YOU ARE GOING TO GET IF YOU VOTE  FOR DONALD TRUMP. EVERY AMERICAN IS ENTITLED TO BE  TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT  IN OUR COUNTRY. EVERY AMERICAN. WHETHER YOU VOTE FOR ME OR  WHETHER YOU VOTE FOR SOMEONE  ELSE, AND I -- SOMEONE ELSE, I WILL BE OUR CHAMPION IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THAT I CAN PROMISE. HILLARY CLINTON REPRESENTS ONLY THE INSIDERS, THE DONORS, AND  THE SPECIAL INTEREST. SHE TALKS CHANGE, BUT WHY HASN'T SHE GIVEN IT IN 35 YEARS? FOR 35 YEARS SHE HAS BEEN HERE,  WHY HASN'T SHE GIVEN CHANGE? SHE NEVER WILL IN A MILLION YEARS.  SHE WON'T DO IT. I WILL BE SPEAKING MORE ABOUT  HILLARY CLINTON'S DISQUALIFYING REMARKS IN A MINUTE. BUT FIRST, LET ME INVITE ONTO THE STAGE SOME OF OUR WONDERFUL SUPPORTERS WHO CAN TELL YOU  THEMSELVES WHAT THEY THINK OF  HER VERY HORRIBLE STATEMENTS THAT SHE MADE THREE DAYS AGO. FOLKS, COME ON UP.   THESE ARE NOT DEEP  HORRIBLE, THAT I CAN TELL YOU. -- DEPLORABLE PEOPLE, THAT I CAN  TELL YOU.  COME ON UP, I'LL GET  RANDOM.  WHO WANTS TO SPEAK?  AND DON'T FORGET, WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT.   WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE HORRIBLE OBAMACARE, AND NEVER EVER FORGET  SUPREME COURT'S JUSTICES.   WOW.  ISN'T THAT GREAT? AND THESE PEOPLE ARE SO  REPRESENTATIVE OF EVERYBODY  THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY. SO I HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON CLINTON'S REMARKS, AND I WILL BE  SHARING THEM MOMENTARILY. BUT FIRST, I WANT TO TELL YOU  WHAT I AM GOING TO DO TO MAKE AMERICA FAR BETTER THAN IT IS  RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW THERE IS ROOM TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE HAVE OUTLINED A DETAILED PLAN ON AID, ON IMMIGRATION. BUILD A WALL. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A WALL.   AND WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL?  100%. THEY MAY NOT KNOW IT YET, BUT  THEY ARE PAYING FOR THE FALL -- THE WALL. I HAVE DELIVERED A PLAN ON DEFEATING ISLAMIC TERRORISM.   ON REFERRING -- ON  REFORMING OUR TAX CODES, ON  RELEASING AMERICAN ENERGY, AND  ON PROVIDING SCHOOLS CHOICE FOR  EVERY DISADVANTAGED CHILD IN AMERICA. WE HAVE RELEASED POLICY AFTER POLICY, SOLUTION AFTER SOLUTION. EVERY DAY, WE'RE GOING FORWARD NEW IDEAS TO MAKE YOUR LIFE  BETTER. WE NEED TO CHANGE P WE HAVE TO  HAVE CHANGED, AND IT HAS TO  HAPPEN QUICKLY. WE ARE GOING IN THE WRONG  DIRECTION RIGHT NOW. THE CHANGE WILL START RIGHT  AWAY, THE MOMENT I TAKE MY OATH  OF OFFICE. RIGHT AWAY.   ON MY FIRST DAY, WE  ARE GOING TO IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE EVERY SINGLE UNCONSTITUTIONAL EXECUTIVE ORDER SIGNED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA.   THEN I AM GOING TO  ORDER A REVIEW OF EVERY SINGLE REGULATION ISSUED OVER THE LAST  EIGHT YEARS. ALL NEEDLESS JOB KILLING REGULATION WILL BE CANCELED.   MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS  WILL COME POURING IN. WE ARE GOING TO LIFT RESTRICTIONS ON AMERICAN ENERGY. THIS WILL CREATE ANOTHER HALF A  MILLION NEW JOBS A YEAR. THAT IS JUST THE BEGINNING.  ON MY FIRST DAY OFFICE, I AM  GOING TO ASK CONGRESS TO SEND ME A BILL TO IMMEDIATELY REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE.   AND THIS WILL SAVE  ANOTHER 2 MILLION JOBS.  IT IS A DISASTER. YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING, YOUR PREMIUMS ARE GOING THROUGH THE  ROOF, YOUR DEDUCTIBLES ARE SO  HIGH YOU WILL NEVER GET TO USE  IT. THE ONLY WAY YOU'LL USE IT IS IT  HAS TO BE A LONG, SLOW DEATH. YOU WILL NEVER GET TO USE IT. I ALSO GOING TO PROPOSE A  MASSIVE TAX CUT TO UNLEASH PROSPERITY IN EVERY CITY AND EVERY STATE AND OUR COUNTRY. TAX CUTS.   I AM GOING TO  INSTRUCT THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN A  REVIEW OF ALL FOREIGN TRADE  PRACTICES THAT UNFAIRLY HURT  AMERICAN MANUFACTURING. YOU KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING TO  YOUR AREA. I WILL USE EVERY LOSS OF POTENTIAL POWER TO ACHIEVE RELIEF -- I WILL USE EVERY LEGAL PRESIDENTIAL POWER TO ACHIEVE RELIEF.  WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR  WORKERS. YOU CAN READ THE FULL SEVEN  POINT TRADE PLAN ON MY WEBSITE, BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WHEN IT  COMES TO TRADE, WE ARE GOING TO  RENEGOTIATE SOME OF THOSE HORRIBLE DEALS.  AND BOY, IS NAFTA BAD. NORTH CAROLINA HAS LOST MORE  THAN 4/10 MANUFACTURING JOB SINCE NAFTA.  BILL CLINTON SIGNED IT, AND  HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTED IT. IT HAS BEEN PERHAPS THE WORST  TRADE DEAL EVER SIGNED, NOT ONLY  IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT ACTUALLY IN  THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, THERE  HAS NEVER BEEN A DEAL LIKE THIS. IT IS A ONE-WAY STREET OUT OF  THE UNITED STATES AND INTO  MEXICO AND OTHER COUNTRIES. NOT GOING TO BE THAT WAY AND YOU IT -- NOT GOING TO BE THAT WAY  ANYMORE, FOLKS. HERE IN ASHEVILLE, YOU HAVE LOST  ONE IN FIVE MANUFACTURING JOBS  SINCE CHINA JOINED THE WORLD  TRADE ORGANIZATION. ANOTHER HILLARY BACK TO DISASTER -- BACKED DISASTER.  HILLARY CLINTON OWES YOU THAT APOLOGY, AND I THINK YOU WILL  THAT APOLOGY RIGHT AROUND THE  SAME TIME SHE HANDS OVER THE  33,000 E-MAILS THAT SHE  DELIVERS.   AND BY THE WAY,  HILLARY DESTROYED HER E-MAILS AFTER SHE RECEIVED A CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENA, AND  NOTHING HAPPENED. SHE GETS A SUBPOENA, AND SHE  DESTROYS THEM.  WHAT IS GOING ON? THEY USED A SPECIAL SOFTWARE  THAT MOST PEOPLE, EVEN  SOPHISTICATED PEOPLE AND THAT  WORLD, DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT.  THEY BLEACHED THEM. SHE EVEN MADE HER 13 DIFFERENT  PHONES DISAPPEAR, AND SOME OF  THEM SHE HAMMERED -- WITH A HAMMER! EXPLAIN THAT ONE. I HAVE NEVER DONE THAT.   SHE OBVIOUSLY HAD A  WHOLE LOT TO HIDE, INCLUDING HER DEEPER -- BEFORE PLAY SCANDAL AS  SECRETARY OF STATE. A FOR PLAY WITH RUSSIAN URANIUM,  WITH CONTRACTS FOR HER FRIENDS  AND FAMILY IN HAITI. NOTHING IS SO DANGEROUS TO  AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AS WHEN A  PUBLIC OFFICIAL'S THEIR FEDERAL  OFFICE UP FOR SALE, AND THAT IS  WHAT HAPPENED HERE.  THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED.  NOTHING IS SO DANGEROUS TO  AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AS WHEN A  PUBLICHILLARY BELIEVES SHE IS ABOVE  THE LAW, BUT SHE ALSO BELIEVES -- AND YOU KNOW THIS -- SHE REALLY BELIEVES THAT SHE IS  ABOVE THE LAW.  SO FAR, SHE HAS TURNED OUT TO  BE.  WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OUR LAWS? AFTER MONTHS OF HIDING FROM THE PRESS, HILLARY CLINTON CAME OUT  AND FINALLY TOLD THE WORLD HOW SHE SHE SAID TENS OF MILLIONS OF PATRIOTIC AMERICANS ARE A BASKET OF DEPLRORABLES. HOW CAN YOU BE PRESIDENT FOR SO  MANY PEOPLE? SHE TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE  THEY ARE OBJECTS, NOT HUMAN  BEINGS. SHE SAID HALF OF OUR SUPPORTERS ARE YOUR T-MOBILE AND NOT  AMERICAN AND DESCRIBES THE OTHER  HALF AS HAVING RUN OUT OF  OPTIONS. WHAT SHE CANNOT UNDERSTAND OR  ACCEPT IS THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY SEES  THROUGH THE LIES OF A FAILED POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT AND FRANKLY, SOON TO BE A FAILED  POLITICIAN.   THE PEOPLE WANT  CHANGE. THE PEOPLE WANT JUSTICE AND THEY WANT A GOVERNMENT THAT PUTS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FIRST.   WHETHER OUR  SUPPORTERS HAVE LOST A JOB FROM  A FACTORY THAT HAS MOVED TO ANOTHER COUNTRY, WHETHER A POLICE CAPTAIN, OR A TEACHER -- THEY ARE UNITED BY THEIR DEEP AND SOPHISTICATED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS  ABANDONED THE PEOPLE. OUR SYSTEM IS RIGGED. A WORD I HAVE BEEN USING FOR A LONG TIME AND NOW IT HAS BEEN  PICKED UP BY EVERYONE. BUT, OUR SYSTEM IS RIGGED. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HIT DIEHARD TIMES, THEY UNDERSTAND  BETTER THAN ANYONE, THAT IT IS  CLINTON'S WALL STREET AGENDA THAT HAS COST THE MIDDLE CLASS OF THIS COUNTRY.  CRUSHED IT. HILLARY CLINTON SPOKE WITH  HATRED IN HER HEART FOR THESE WORKING-CLASS AMERICANS. ABSOLUTE HATRED IN HER HEART. COULD WE HAVE A DOCTOR PLEASE? A DOCTOR. A DOCTOR, PLEASE. THANK YOU. A DOCTOR, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, DOCTOR. THANK YOU. IT IS ABOUT 100 DEGREES IN HERE, FOLKS. THANK YOU, SO MUCH. WE LOVE OUR SUPPORTERS, RIGHT? LET US GIVE HER A HAND.  GET SOME WATER. GET SOME WATER, KEVIN, PLEASE. TAKE YOUR TIME. DO NOT WORRY.  WE ALL HAVE TIME, RIGHT?  THAT IS A GREAT SUPPORTER. AND UNBELIEVABLE PERSON. BEEN HERE FOR A LONG TIME, AND I  JUST WANT TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU, DARLING. AND WHETHER IT WAS A SUPPORTER  OR NOT, WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING  ABOUT, RIGHT? THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING  ABOUT.  AND IT IS PRETTY HOT IN HERE. IT IS LIKE, PRETTY HOT. HILLARY LOOKS DOWN ON PEOPLE, AND FRANKLY, THESE ARE PEOPLE  THAT HAVE BEEN SO UNBELIEVABLE  FOR OUR COUNTRY.  SHE LOOKS DOWN ON THE CARPENTERS, THE PLUMBERS, AND  THE ELECTRICIANS. SHE LOOKS DOWN ON POLICE  OFFICERS, SOLDIERS, AND FIREFIGHTERS AND EVERYONE  SUPPORTING OUR CAMPAIGN AND WE  HAVE LARGE CHUNKS. WE HAVE EVERYONE SUPPORTING US,  FOLKS.  EVERYBODY. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN SO  SUCCESSFUL. WE HAVE SOME THAT HAVE NOT BEEN  QUITE AS SUCCESSFUL. LET ME TELL YOU, WE HAVE EVERYONE BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT A MESS OUR COUNTRY IS IN. SHE LOOKS DOWN ON THE PEOPLE WHO COOK HER MEALS, DRIVE HER CAR'S, AND DIG THE POLLS THAT POWER HER  ELECTRICITY. -- AND DIG THE COAL THAT  POWER HER ELECTRICITY.  OBAMA AND CLINTON HAVE DESTROYED  THE LIVES OF THE MINERS AND THE  STEELWORKERS OUR NEXT AND YOU  SEE THAT COMING. SHE CALLS THESE AMERICANS EVERY  NAME IN THE BOOK -- RACIST, SEXIST, XENOPHOBIA, ISLAM A  PHOBIC. SHE SAID THEY WERE NOT EVEN AMERICAN. RIGHT? ANYONE XENOPHOBIA? I DON'T THINK SO. NEVER IN HISTORY HAS A MAJOR PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SO VICIOUSLY DEMONIZED THE AMERICAN  VOTER. SHE WAS ATTACKING MILLIONS OF MOMS AND DADS WHO LOVE THEIR CHILDREN AND WANT A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL AMERICANS. THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT. WHAT SHOULD THESE PARENTS TELL THEIR CHILDREN ABOUT HILLARY  CLINTON? >>   LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION -- IS THERE ANY PLACE  IN AMERICA MORE FUN TO BE THAN A TRUMP RALLY? NOBODY -- NOWHERE. WHAT SHOULD THESE PARENTS TELL  HILLARY CLINTON ABOUT --TELL THEIR CHILDREN ABOUT HILLARY  CLINTON AND HER ATTACKS? IT IS OK. THE CAMERA IS FOLLOWING. >>   THE DISHONEST MEDIA WILL NOT REPORT THAT.  THEY WILL NOT. THEY SAY WE ARE BAD PEOPLE. THEY WILL NOT REPORT BACK. HERE IS THE STORY, FOLKS. IT IS A FEW PEOPLE OUT OF THOUSANDS. THE DISHONEST MEDIA, THESE  PEOPLE, THE MOST DISHONEST PEOPLE. YOU CAN EVER FIND. THEY WILL NOT REPORT THAT. THEY WILL NOT REPORT THE  GESTURE. THEY WILL NOT REPORT ANYTHING. BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THE CAMERAS  FOLLOWED THEM. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET  THE CAMERAS TO MOVE SO THEY  WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE HOW MANY  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WE HAVE HERE  AND OUTSIDE. THE MEDIA IS DISGUSTING. LET ME TELL YOU -- SOMEONE SAID,  WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED MOST? AND I HAVE LEARNED NUMBER ONE HOW GREAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  ARE A NUMBER TWO, HOW TOTALLY  DISHONEST THE MEDIA IS. LOOK AT THAT HORRIBLE SIGN. LOOK AT THAT HORRIBLE,  DISGUSTING SIGN.  LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT HORRIBLE, DISGUSTING --CAN YOU SEE THE SIGN? LET ME TELL YOU -- NO ONE WILL REPORT THAT. THEY WILL SAY THAT WE WERE RUDE  BECAUSE WE SHOUTED THEM DOWN. WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET SMART,  FOLKS? YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH IS, THAT IS  WHY WE HAVE A MOVEMENT BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE.  I AM TELLING YOU.  WE ARE GOING TO PUT  SANITY BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE.  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE LAW AND ORDER AND SAFETY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE JOBS AND  EDUCATION. WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR  SECOND AMENDMENT. WE ARE GOING TO DO A LOT OF  GREAT THINGS. IF I GET THE CHANCE, I WILL  FIGHT RIGHT ALONGSIDE OUR PEOPLE TO DELIVER A MUCH BETTER FUTURE  FOR EVERYONE. WE HAVE PEOPLE, MANY OF THE  PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE, THAT  MADE MORE MONEY IN REAL WAGES 18  YEARS AGO THAN THEY DO TODAY AND THEY ARE WORKING HARDER TODAY  AND THEY HAVE TWO JOBS. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. CLINTON MADE HER REMARKS AT A  HIGH DOLLAR FUNDRAISER ON WALL  STREET.  HER GOAL IS SIMPLE -- TO BULLY  THE AMERICAN VOTER OUT OF VOTING FOR CHANGE. THE PEOPLE WHO RIGGED THE SYSTEM WANT TO KEEP THINGS EXACTLY AS  THEY ARE.  IT HAS BEEN VERY GOOD.  THEY WANT TO KEEP OUR TERRIBLE  TRADE DEALS AND THEY ARE  TERRIBLE.  THEY DO NOT WANT RENEGOTIATION  BECAUSE THEY ARE ON THE OTHER  SIDE OF A LOT OF THE DEALS THAT  ARE MOVING TO MEXICO AND OTHER  PLACES. THEY LIKE THEM JUST FINE. BUT THEY ARE KILLING THE  AMERICAN JOBS. THEY WANT TO TRAP CHILDREN IN FAILING GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS. THEY WANT MASS REGULATION TO  KEEP AMERICAN SMALL BUSINESSES  FROM BEING ABLE TO COMPETE WITH BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD.  HILLARY CLINTON CAN NEVER BE  PRESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY. WHAT SHE JUST SAID SHOWS WHAT A LOW OPINION SHE HAS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- WE CANNOT LET  THAT HAPPEN. YOU HAVE GOT TO GET OUT NOVEMBER  8. YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OCTOBER 20,  YOU START SENDING IN THOSE  VOTES.  EARLIER TODAY, I HAD A CHANCE TO  SPEND SOME TIME WITH SOME OF OUR  MOST AMAZING AMERICANS. I SPENT THE AFTERNOON WITH A  NATIONAL GUARD ASSOCIATION OF  THE UNITED STATES. INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. THESE ARE THE HEROES WHO RESCUE OUR PEOPLE IN DISASTERS AND TO FIGHT IN OUR WARS. THESE HEROES ARE A PERMANENT  TESTAMENT TO THE CURRENT AND  CHARACTER OF OUR NATION.  WE ALSO HONOR AND REMEMBER THE  LIVES OF THE SERVICE MEMBERS WHO  HAVE MADE THE ULTIMATE  SACRIFICE. THERE IS NO GREATER LOVE THAN  THE LOVE SHOWN BY THE MEN AND  WOMEN WHO HAVE LAID DOWN THEIR  LIVES FOR THIS COUNTRY AND FOR  ITS PEOPLE. NOTHING GREATER THAN THAT. OUR DEBT TO THEM IS ETERNAL AND EVERLASTING. LET ME ALSO CAUSE FOR A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE SHELBY COUNTY POLICE OFFICERS -- SHELBY COUNTY  POLICE OFFICER, TIM -- WHO WAS  SHOT IN THE LINE OF DUTY TODAY  LEAVING BEHIND A WIFE AND  BEAUTIFUL CHILD. WE MOURN THIS TERRIBLE LOSS AND WE PLEDGE TO ALWAYS STAND WITH OUR INCREDIBLE POLICE AND LAW  ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS. IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE MUST ALSO ENSURE THAT OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN  THE ARMED SERVICES HAVE THE BEST  EQUIPMENT, RESOURCES, AND TOOL ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. WE DON'T ANYMORE.  WE ARE TOTALLY DEPLETED. WE HAVE THE GREATEST PEOPLE ON EARTH BUT OUR MILITARY SERVICES  ARE DEPLETED WITH BAD EQUIPMENT,  OLD EQUIPMENT.  IT IS A TERRIBLE THING THAT HAS  HAPPENED. WE MUST PROVIDE THEM WITH THE  BEST MEDICAL CARE WHILE THEY  SERVE. AND WHEN THEY RETURN HOME TO  CIVILIAN LIFE. THE VETERAN SCANDALS THAT HAVE  OCCURRED UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THAT HAVE  BEEN DISMISSED BY MY OPPONENT ARE A PERMANENT STAIN ON OUR  GOVERNMENT.  IT IS JUST ONE MORE WAY HILLARY CLINTON ONLY LOOKS OUT FOR  HERSELF. WE MUST TAKE CARE OF OUR  VETERANS.  AND THAT INCLUDES GIVING  VETERANS A CARD THAT GIVES THEM THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE TREATMENT AT V.A. FACILITIES OR A PRIVATE  DOCTOR OF THEIR CHOICE. WE HAVE TO DO IT. YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING  WHERE PEOPLE ARE WAITING IN LINE I'VE DAYS, SEVEN DAYS, 10 DAYS,  AND THEY ARE DYING. 22 SUICIDES A DAY. 22 SUICIDES A DAY. WHO CAN EVEN BELIEVE THAT  NUMBER. WHEN A SIMPLE SOLUTION COULD BE  AT HAND.  A PRESCRIPTION. A SMALL OPERATION. AND THEY ARE DYING. AND THEY ARE KILLING THEMSELVES.  AND THEY HAVE DONE SO MUCH FOR  US. IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANY LONGER.  BELIEVE ME. JUST TODAY, WE LEARNED THAT THE  V.A. HAS VIOLATED A FEDERAL LAW BY FAILING TO MAKE ITS  PERFORMANCE RECORDS AVAILABLE TO  CONSUMERS. THE SCANDALS NEVER SEEM TO END.  BUT THEY WILL END WHEN I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT, AND IT WILL  AND QUICKLY. -- AND IT WILL END QUICKLY.  HILLARY CLINTON WAS QUOTED FAIRLY RECENTLY SAYING THE V.A. IS FINE.  THE V.A. IS WORKING. NOT WORKING, HILLARY. I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW SO MANY VETERANS, BELIEVE ME, IT IS NOT  WORKING. NOTHING MAKES ME MORE PROUD THAN TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE MEN  AND WOMEN WHO WEAR THE UNIFORM. WE HAVE RECEIVED ENDORSEMENTS FROM 120 GENERALS AND ADMIRALS. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW  HOW TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE. THESE ARE OUR FIGHTERS, OUR  GREAT, GREAT FIGHTERS AND SO I WANT TO THANK EACH AND EVERY ONE  OF THEM AND THERE ARE MORE  COMING. JUST TODAY, I WAS PROFOUNDLY  HUMBLED TO GAIN THE ENDORSEMENT OF 13 MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENTS. 13. AND I CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO SAY  HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ME TO HAVE  THEIR SUPPORT. THESE ARE TRULY GREAT HEROES.  ALSO TODAY, I WAS THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE THAT AMBASSADOR RJ WILL THE, WARMER HEAD OF THE CIA, ONE  OF THE MOST RESPECTED PEOPLE  ANYWHERE IN THE GOVERNMENT, IS  NOW EIGHT SENIOR ADVISOR TO OUR  CAMPAIGN. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST  RESPECTED PEOPLE. A GREAT MAN. WE ARE ON A MISSION OF CHANGE  AND THAT INCLUDES A NEW AGENDA  FOR OUR INNER CITIES.  OUR INNER CITIES, FOLKS. THEY ARE A MESS.  THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS RUN THE INNER CITIES FOR 50-100 YEARS  STRAIGHT. DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS LIKE CLINTON, DISRESPECT THESE VOTERS  AND TAKE THEM FOR GRANTED. THEY WANT THE VOTE AND THEN THEY SAY -- SEE YOU IN FOUR YEARS. REMEMBER HILLARY'S WORDS, SUPER PREDATOR.  REMEMBER THOSE WORDS. SUPER PREDATOR. THOSE ARE HER WORDS. AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN, LIVE IN POVERTY, FOUR IN 10 INCLUDING  45% OF THOSE UNDER THE AGE OF  SIX. THEY LIVE IN POVERTY. THEIR SCHOOLS ARE FEELING -- SAILING AND 58% OF AFRICAN YOUTH  ARE NOT EMPLOYED. 3000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOT IN CHICAGO SINCE THE BEGINNING OF  THE YEAR.  FOR THOSE SUFFERING AND HURTING, I SAY -- GIVE DONALD TRUMP A  CHANCE.  I WILL FIX IT. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.  IT CANNOT GET ANY WORSE. IT CANNOT GET ANY WORSE. YOU CAN GO TO WAR -- AND YOU KNOW THIS IS TRUE.  YOU CAN GO TO AFGHANISTAN. YOU CAN GO TO WAR-TORN COUNTRIES AND DID -- AND YOU WILL FIND  THAT IT IS SAFER THAN BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME OF OUR  CITIES. WE WILL GIVE SECURITY AND  SAFETY. WE WILL GIVE EDUCATION AND JOBS. WE WILL BRING JOBS BACK FROM  MEXICO. AND ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES  STEALING OUR JOBS. WE WILL GET PEOPLE WORKING.  AND WE ARE GOING TO LOVE IT.  I WILL FIGHT OR DETROIT, CHICAGO, BALTIMORE, AND EVERY  NEGLECTED PART OF THIS COUNTRY, NEGLECTED BY THE DEMOCRATS.  AND I WILL FIGHT TO BRING US ALL  TOGETHER AS ONE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  I WILL DO THAT. AND I SAY TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE, I SAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. I WILL FIX IT. AND REALLY, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO  LOSE? IT CANNOT GET ANY WORSE. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? I WILL FIX IT. IMAGINE WHAT OUR COUNTRY COULD ACCOMPLISH IF WE STARTED WORKING TOGETHER AS ONE PEOPLE UNDER ONE GOD SALUTING ONE AMERICAN FLAG. ONE AMERICAN FLAG. >>  USA USA USA USA  WHAT IS GOING ON  TODAY, FOLKS? WHAT IS GOING ON? IT IS TIME TO BREAK WITH THE BITTER FAILURES OF THE PAST AND EMBRACE THE NEW AMERICAN FUTURE. THIS IS A FUTURE WE WILL RESPECT. WE WILL RESPECT THE DIGNITIES OF  ALL AMERICANS WHICH MEANS GREAT JOBS, GREAT SCHOOLS, AND GREAT  NEIGHBORHOODS, AND IT ALSO MEANS  SAFETY. IT MEANS SAFETY. WE WILL HAVE THE STEADFAST SUPPORT FOR AMERICA AND FOR ITS  LAW ENFORCEMENT. EVERYONE WANTS THAT. JOBS WILL RETURN. PROSPERITY WILL RISE.  AND NEW FACTORIES WILL COME RUSHING BACK TO NORTH CAROLINA  AND EVERY OTHER STATE IN OUR  COUNTRY. GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION WILL END. HONESTY WILL BE RESTORED.

AND WE ARE BOUND TOGETHER AND I  SEE THAT TODAY.  THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING DAY FOR ME.  THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN FATE  IMMUNITY HAS BEEN ONE OF GOD'S  GREATEST GIFTS TO AMERICA AND TO  ITS PEOPLE.  THERE IS PERHAPS NO ACTION OUR  LEADERS CAN TAKE TO DO MORE TO HEAL OUR COUNTRY AND SUPPORT OUR PEOPLE, AND TO PROVIDE A GREATER PLATFORM TO THE BLACK CHURCHES AND CHURCHGOERS. YOU DO RIGHT EVERY DAY BY YOUR COMMUNITY AND YOUR FAMILIES.  YOU RAISE CHILDREN IN THE LIGHT  OF GOD.  AND I WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT YOUR  CHURCH, ALWAYS, AND DEFEND YOUR  RIGHT TO WORSHIP. SO IMPORTANT. I AM HERE TO LISTEN TO YOUR MESSAGE, AND I HOPE MY PRESENCE HERE WILL ALSO HELP YOUR VOICE TO REACH NEW AUDIENCES IN OUR COUNTRY, AND MANY OF THESE AUDIENCES DESPERATELY NEED YOUR  SPIRIT IN YOUR PRAYER.  CHRISTIAN FAITH IS NOT THE PAST,  BUT THE PRESENT OF FUTURE.  MAKE IT STRONGER.  MAKE IT STRONGER.  OPEN IT UP TO GREAT, GREAT  LEADERS LIKE BISHOP JACKSON, DR.  JACKSON.  AND SO MANY OTHERS.  AND SO MANY OTHERS ACTUALLY  SITTING HERE.  DARRELL SCOTT WHO HAS BEEN WITH  ME FOR SO LONG.  OMAROSA, WHO IS A VERY NICE  PERSON.  I DON'T WANT TO DESTROY HER  IMAGE FOR SAYING THAT.  SHE IS A VERY NICE PERSON AND A PASTOR.  AND THERE IS SOMEONE WHO HAS  BEEN VERY SPECIAL TO ME, DR. BEN CARSON.  STAND UP, BEN.  COME HERE.  THIS IS A GREAT MAN AND A GREAT GUY.  SO, AS I PREPARE TO CAMPAIGN ALL  ACROSS THE NATION, AND IN EVERY  COMMUNITY, I WILL HAVE AND  OPPORTUNITY TO LAY OUT MY PLANS  FOR ECONOMIC CHANGE, WHICH WOULD  BE SO GREAT FOR DETROIT, AND SO  GREAT FOR THIS COMMUNITY,  BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO BRING JOBS. THANK YOU.  WE ARE TAKING THEM BACK FROM  MEXICO.  AND EVERYWHERE ELSE BECAUSE THEY  ARE GONE I WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO  DISCUSS ON HOW TO PUT EVERY  AMERICAN ON THE LATTER FOR  SUCCESS FOR GRADE EDUCATION AND  GREAT JOBS.  BUT TODAY, I WANT TO LET YOU  KNOW, THAT I AM HERE TO LISTEN  TO YOU, AND I HAVE BEEN DOING THAT.  WE HAD A FANTASTIC INTERVIEW  WITH THE BISHOP JACKSON.  HE IS BETTER THAN THE PEOPLE WHO  DO THAT PROFESSIONALLY.  HE IS BETTER.  AND I DID NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT I  WAS GETTING MYSELF INTO.  IS THIS GOING TO BE WILD.  HE IS A GREAT GENTLEMAN AND A  VERY NICE GUY.  JUST HOPE YOU DON'T LOSE HIM TO HOLLYWOOD. AND ESPECIALLY DR. JACKSON. SHE MAY BE GONE.  LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE TELEVISION CAMERAS THERE.  LOOK AT ALL THOSE TELEVISION CAMERAS.  I AM START TO DO THAT TO YOU,  BISHOP. IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS, RIGHT? OUR NATION IS TOO DIVIDED. WE TALK PAST EACH OTHER, NOT TO  EACH OTHER.  THOSE WHO SEEK OFFICE DO NOT DO  ENOUGH TO STEP INTO THE  COMMUNITY AND LEARN WHAT IS  GOING ON.  THEY DON'T KNOW. THEY HAVE NO CLUE.  I AM HERE TODAY TO LEARN SO WE  CAN TOGETHER, REMEDY INJUSTICE  IN ANY FORM, SO THAT WE COULD  ALSO REMEDY ECONOMICS.  SO THAT HE AFRICAN-AMERICAN  COMMUNITY -- SO THAT THE  AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY CAN  BENEFIT ECONOMICALLY THROUGH  JOBS AND INCOME IN SO MANY  DIFFERENT WAYS.  OUR POLITICALLY SYSTEM HAS  FAILED THE PEOPLE AND WORKS ONLY  TO ENRICH ITSELF. I WANT TO REFORM THAT SYSTEM SO  THAT IT WORKS FOR YOU.  EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM.  I BELIEVE TRUE REFORM CAN ONLY  COME FROM OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM.  I REALLY MEAN THAT.  BEING A BUSINESSMAN IS MUCH  DIFFERENT THAN BEING A  POLITICIAN BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND  WHAT IS HAPPENING. AND WE ARE GOING OUTSIDE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT.  BECOMING THE NOMINEE OF THE  PARTY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN, A LOT  OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT  ABRAHAM LINCOLN, THE GREAT  ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS A REPUBLICAN. HAS BEEN THE GREATEST HONOR OF MY LIFE.  IT IS ON HIS LEGACY THAT I HOPE  TO BUILD THE FUTURE OF THE  PARTY, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY IN THE COMMUNITY. I BELIEVE WE NEED A CIVIL RIGHTS AGENDA OF OUR TIME, THE RIGHT TO  A GREAT EDUCATION AND THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN SAFETY AND PEACE AND  HAVE A REALLY GREAT JOB, A GOOD PAYING JOB, AND ONE YOU LOVE TO GO TO EVERY MORNING. AND THAT CAN HAPPEN. WE CAN BRING OUR COMPANIES BACK.  IT ALSO MEANS THE RIGHT TO HAVE  A GOVERNMENT THAT PROTECTS OUR WORKERS AND REALLY FIGHTS FOR OUR JOBS. I WANT TO HELP YOU BUILD AND REBUILD THE, AND WE CAN DO THAT, ESPECIALLY WITH PEOPLE LIKE  BISHOP JACKSON AND DR. JACKSON.  I MEAN THAT.  IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE.  NOTHING IS MORE SAD THAN WHEN WE  SIDELINE YOUNG BLACK MEN WITH  UNFULFILLED POTENTIAL,  TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL.  I MET SOME PEOPLE THIS MORNING  WHO WERE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE AND  THEY'RE LOOKING FOR JOBS.  THESE ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE, YOUNG PEOPLE.  OUR WHOLE COUNTRY LOSES OUT WHEN  WE ARE UNABLE TO HARNESS THE  BRILLIANCE AND ENERGY OF THESE FOLKS.  WE ARE ONE NATION, AND WHEN  ANYONE HURTS, WE ALL HURT  TOGETHER, AND THAT'S SO TRUE.  WE ARE ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS,  AND ALL CREATED BY THE SAME GOD.  WE MUST LOVE EACH OTHER AND  SUPPORT EACH OTHER, AND WE ARE  IN THIS ALTOGETHER. ALTOGETHER.  I FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE  AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS  SUFFERED FROM DISCRIMINATION,  AND THERE ARE MANY WRONGS THAT  MUST STILL BE MADE RIGHT, THAT  WILL BE MADE RIGHT.  I WANT TO MAKE AMERICA  PROSPEROUS FOR EVERYONE.  I WANT TO MAKE THE CITY THE  ECONOMIC ENVY OF THE WORLD.  WE CAN DO THAT, WE CAN DO THAT AGAIN.  FACTORIES EVERYWHERE, NEW ROADS  AND BRIDGES, NEW SCHOOLS,  ESPECIALLY SCHOOLS, AND HOPE.  I HAVE BEEN SO GREATLY BLESSED  IN SO MANY WAYS WITH NO GREATER  BLESSINGS IN MY FAMILY.  NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER  AND MORE FULFILLED THAN TO USE  WHAT I HAVE LEARNED IN BUSINESS  AND IN TRAVELING ALL OVER THE  WORLD AND SORT OF SEEING A LOT  TO BRING THE WEALTH AND  PROSPERITY AND OPPORTUNITY TO  THOSE WHO HAVE NOT HAD THESE  OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE, AND THAT'S  MANY, MANY PEOPLE IN DETROIT.  WHEN I SEE WAGES FALLING, PEOPLE  OUT OF WORK, I KNOW THE  HARDSHIPS THIS INFLICTS AND I'M  DETERMINED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  I WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  I DO GET THINGS DONE.  SOME PEOPLE HAVE STRENGTHS.  THAT'S ONE OF MINE.  I GET THINGS DONE.  FOR ANY WHO HAVE HEARD IT,  THINGS ARE GOING TO TURN AROUND.  TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER.  THE PASTOR AND I WERE TALKING  ABOUT RIDING UP THE STREET AND  WE SEE ALL THOSE CLOSED STORES  AND PEOPLE SITTING ON THE  SIDEWALK AND NO JOBS AND NO ACTIVITY.  WE WILL GET IT TURNED AROUND, PASTOR.  BELIEVE ME.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN AGAIN AS A  COUNTRY AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN  AGAIN FOR ALL OF OUR PEOPLE.  I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU TO RENEW  THE BONDS OF TRUST BETWEEN  CITIZENS AND THE BONDS OF FAITH  THAT MAKE OUR NATION STRONG.  AMERICA HAS BEEN LIFTED OUT OF  MANY OF ITS MOST DIFFICULT  HOURS, THROUGH THE MARIGOLD OF  FACE, AND THROUGH PEOPLE LIKE  BISHOP JACKSON AND DR. JACKSON.  SO IMPORTANT. PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA HOW  IMPORTANT THEY ARE.  NOW IN THESE HARD TIMES FOR OUR  COUNTRY, LET US TURN AGAIN TO  OUR CHRISTIAN HERITAGE TO LIFT  UP THE SOUL OF OUR NATION.  I'M SO DEEPLY GRATEFUL TO BE  HERE TODAY, AND IT IS MY PRAYER  THAT AMERICA OF TOMORROW, THAT  THE AMERICA OF TOMORROW WILL BE ONE OF UNITY, TOGETHERNESS, AND PEACE. AND PERHAPS WE CAN ADD THE WORD PROSPERITY. VERY PROSPEROUS.  I'D LIKE TO CONCLUDE WITH A  PASSAGE FROM FIRST JOHN CHAPTER FOUR.  MOST GROUPS I SPEAK TO DON'T  KNOW THAT, BUT WE KNOW.  IF YOU WANT, WE CAN SAY IT TOGETHER.  NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN GOD BUT IF  WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER, GOD LOVES -- LIVES IN US AND HIS LOVE IS  MADE COMPLETE IN US.  AND THAT'S SO TRUE.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  THIS HAS BEEN AN HONOR.  THANK YOU SIR.  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU.",Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Remarks in Detroit

WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A GREAT  WALL ON THE BORDER AND THE TWO VERIFY --NATIONAL E-VERIFY,  REFORM WELFARE ENTITLEMENT, AND  HAVE AN EXIT ENTRY SYSTEM TO  ENSURE THOSE THAT OVERSTAY VISAS ARE QUICKLY REMOVED. WE DON'T ENFORCE OUR VISA EXPIRATION DATES. THEN WE HAVE BORDERS AND NOTHING BUT CRIME. I'M ALSO GOING TO CANCEL ALL UNCONSTITUTIONAL ORDERS,  EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT YOU HAVE IN HEARING ABOUT -- WE HAVE A  BIT OF AN EXCESSIVE EXCESSIVE ORDER PRESIDENT -- AND THE POWER  OF THE RANK-AND-FILE PATROL BORDER OFFICERS TO DO THE JOB  THEY WERE MEANT TO DO. WHAT IS HILLARY CLINTON GOING TO  DO, GOVERNOR? NOT MUCH, RIGHT? SHE HAS PLACED AMNESTY IN THE  FIRST 100 DAYS COMBINED WITH HER ELIMINATION OF VIRTUALLY ALL ROUTINE IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. IN OTHER WORDS, TOTALLY OPEN BORDERS. THIS IS A MASSIVE CRIME WAVE. IT'S NOT THAT HAPPENED IF I GOT  ELECTED. MOST ALARMINGLY, SHE HAS PRESSED -- HAS PLEDGED PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE AMNESTY DIRECTLY  DISREGARDING A SUPREME COURT  INJUNCTION. SHE PLEDGED TO ADD ANOTHER  EXECUTIVE IN MISTY IN VIOLATION OF BOTH CONGRESSIONAL LAW AND U.S. CONSTITUTION. THESE ACTIONS FROM HILLARY  CLINTON WILL TRIGGER A CRISIS  GREATER THAN ALMOST ANYTHING WE  HAVE SEEN.  THIS WILL BE A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS LIKE WE HAVE NOT SEEN IN  OUR COUNTRY. IN EFFECT, SHE IS PLEDGING TO ABOLISH THE LAW MAKING POWERS OF  CONGRESS AND ASSUME THE POWERS OF AN IMPERIAL LEADER. I DON'T THINK SHE IS AN IMPERIAL  LEADER. SHE DOES NOT EVEN LOOK  PRESIDENTIAL TO ME. SHE CERTAINLY DOESN'T. THIS EXECUTIVE AMNESTY WOULD BYPASS CONGRESS TO ALLOW  MILLIONS OF WORK PERMITS TO  THOSE INELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE  THEM. HILLARY CLINTON'S LEGISLATIVE PLAN IS TO GIVE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ACCESS TO OBAMACARE SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE, AND  U.S. WELFARE.  I CAN SEE ONE MAN DOES NOT LIKE  THAT VERY MUCH. HER PLAN WILL FUNCTIONALLY AND  ENFORCEMENT OF THE VISA OVERSTAY  RULES, ANOTHER OPEN OPEN BORDER DEGREE. SHE WILL CLOSE DOWN DETENTION  CENTERS BORDER CROSSINGS,  MEANING SHE WILL HAVE AN OPEN  SOUTHERN BORDER THAT WILL BRING  NOTHING BUT CRIME AND  DESTRUCTION. THIS IS NOT TO MENTION THAT SHE WANTS A 550% INCREASE IN SYRIAN REFUGEES FLOWING INTO OUR  COUNTRY.  AND SHE CAN'T EVEN SAY THE WORDS  RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. SHE SUPPORTS CENTURY CITIES AND  CATCH AND RELEASE POLICIES THAT  ARE GETTING AMERICANS KILLED. WE WILL END THAT SO QUICKLY. I NEED THE SUPPORT -- WILL I  HAVE THE SUPPORT? YOU ARE NOT A BIG ONE FOR  SANCTUARY CITIES, I KNOW THAT. I'VE MET WITH MANY OF THESE GRIEVING FAMILIES, INCLUDING A  FAMILY THAT IS TRULY INCREDIBLE. THE FAMILY OF SARAH RUTH, A STRAIGHT A STUDENT. A YOUNG BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WHO WAS  KILLED BY AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT  RELEASED FROM THE BORDER BY OBAMA AND OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WITH HORRIBLE POLICY. AND THEN RELEASED AGAIN AFTER THE KILLING. I HAVE BEEN SO INSPIRED BY THE  COURAGE AND BRAVERY BY SO MANY FAMILIES. I HAVE THAT FAMILY WITH US  TODAY. I WOULD LIKE THEM TO STEP UP AND SAY HELLO. THESE ARE INCREDIBLE.   WHAT INCREDIBLE FAMILY.  THE CRIME IS UNBELIEVABLE.  THERE IS A REASON WE JUST GOT ENDORSED BY 16,500 BORDER PATROL AGENT. THEY KNOW THE SYSTEM BETTER THAN  ANYBODY. THEY WANT TO SEE A STRONG  BORDER. WE NEED A STRONG BORDER IF WE  REMAIN A COUNTRY. I WANT TO THANK THEM IN PARTICULAR. HILLARY'S PLAN IS VERY DANGEROUS  AND DIVISIVE AND RADICAL AND  RECKLESS. IT'S WRECKING THE INNOCENT LIVES  OF SO MANY PEOPLE. WE WILL HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS ALLOWING PEOPLE TO COME IN. IF I AM ELECTED, WE ARE NOT CAN  HAVE A CRISIS. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A STRONG  GREAT COUNTRY AGAIN. THE CHOICE HOPEFULLY WILL BE  CLEAR TO THE PEOPLE OF IOWA AND  THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. A VOETE FOR TRUMP IS A VOTE TO  HAVE A NATION OF LAWS, A VOTE FOR CLINTON IS A VOTE TO HAVE DANGEROUS OPEN BORDERS WHERE  ANYBODY CAN JUST WALK IN AND DO  WHATEVER THEY WANT. ON EVERY ISSUE OUR CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT MAKING LIFE BETTER FOR WORKING PEOPLE. WE CAN'T ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL WITHOUT BREAKING UP THE SPECIAL  INTEREST MONOPOLY AND GIVING THE  POWER BACK TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. MANY HAVE SAID THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA ASSAULT ON TME -- ASSAULT ON ME HAS BEEN  THE GREATEST THAT THEY HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE POLITICAL HISTORY. I FEEL IT. I KNOW IT. EVEN TODAY SOME MAJOR PAPERS FILLED TO MENTION HOW STRONG OUR  POLL NUMBERS HAVE BECOME OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS. WE ARE DOING VERY WELL IN IOWA. WE HAPPENED TO BE LEADING.  BUT THEY REFUSE TO PRINT IT. THEY HAVE NO CHOICE EVENTUALLY. THE MEDIA IS TOTALLY DISHONEST. RIGGED SYSTEM TRYING TO DENY  PEOPLE THE POSITIVE CHANGES THEY  DESERVE. THEY TAKE PHRASES AND STATEMENTS, CHOP THEM UP OUT OF CONTEXT, AND DISCUSS THEM FOR  DAYS AND DAYS. ALWAYS TRYING TO DEMEAN AND BELITTLE, WHATEVER THEY CAN DO. OUR INCREDIBLE MOVEMENT, BECAUSE  WE HAVE A MOVEMENT, THIS IS  MAYBE THE MOVEMENT THEY HAVE  SEEN IN THE COUNTRY. MANY HAVE SAID THAT. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY  BACK FROM THIS DEATH SPIRAL THAT  IT'S CURRENTLY IN. IMAGINE IF THIS MUCH MEDIA  ATTENTION WAS SPENT TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT THE REAL PROBLEMS  FACING OUR COUNTRY. IMAGINE IF THE MEDIA SPENT AS  MUCH TIME TELLING THE STORY OF SARAH RUTH, ONE OF THE GREAT  YOUNG PEOPLE. ALL OF THE UGLY THINGS BEING  SAID BY HILLARY CLINTON AND OUR OPPONENTS -- THEY ARE SPENDING  HUNDREDS OF MILLION DOLLARS ON  PHONY FALSE ADS. AND MOST PEOPLE KNOW IT, OR WE  WOULD NOT BE DOING SO WELL. SHE IS FUNDED BY THE BIG BANKS  AND WALL STREET DONORS. NOTHING MORE THAN A DESPERATE  ATTEMPT FROM A FAILED LEADER. SHE LOST BADLY TO BARACK OBAMA WHEN SHE WON. I THINK SHE WILL LOSE BADLY TO  DONALD TRUMP.  SHE IS CLINGING IN ORDER TO KEEP  THE RATING SYSTEM GOING. THERE IS NOTHING THEY WON'T SAY  OR DO, NO LIE THEY WON'T TELL, NO AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY WON'T SPEND TO TRY AND BULLY VOTERS  INTO GIVING THEM WHAT THEY WANT. THEY LIE LIKE I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING BEFORE.  THE COMMERCIALS ARE PHONY, THEY  ARE DISGUSTING. AND EVEN PEOPLE ON HER SIDE ARE CITING THAT IS GOING TO FAR. THIS NOVEMBER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO REJECT THE  CYNICISM OF THE PAST AND EMBRACE  THE OPTIMISM OF THE FUTURE. WE HAVE A GREAT FUTURE.  THE OLD ATTACKS ARE NOT GOING TO  WORK ANYMORE. THE CLINTON FEAR MONGERING IS  NOT GOING TO RESONATE WITH ANYONE. AND THEIR BASE HAS GOTTEN FAR  LEFT. I WANT TO EMPOWER THE PEOPLE. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO SCARE  THE PEOPLE. EMPOWERING PEOPLE BEGINS WITH 3  SIMPLE WORDS. OUR ECONOMY IS GOING TO SOAR. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SO STRONG AND SO POWERFUL. WE NEED THE POWER. OTHER PEOPLE WILL NOT WANT TO  MESS WITH THE UNITED STATES OF  AMERICA.  WAGES WILL RISE, WE WILL MAKE  NEW FRIENDS ABROAD, AND WE WILL  ACHIEVE WHAT WE HAVE NOT  ACHIEVED BEFORE. WE WILL ACHIEVE A LASTING PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. WE WILL BE A COUNTRY OF LAWS AND  SUCCESS. OUR CITIES WILL BE SAFE, SOUND, AND SECURE.  OUR GOVERNMENT WILL BE ETHICAL AND RESPONSIVE. RULE BY SPECIAL INTERESTS WILL BE OVER. OVER. THE RULE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  WILL BEGIN. LET'S GET OUT ON VOTE ON  NOVEMBER 8 AND CREATE THE FUTURE  OUR CHILDREN DESERVE TOGETHER. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE  AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE AMERICA  UNITED AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.  WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  THANK YOU JONI ERNST.

TO EVERYONE WATCHING ACROSS OUR NATION, TO EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN LET DOWN BY OUR TERRIBLE POLITICIANS, I AM ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE ON NOVEMBER 8.   THIS IS YOUR CHANCE  TO REMOVE THE SPECIAL INTEREST  FROM THEIR THRONE OF POWER TO  THE GOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND FOR THE PEOPLE.   NO ONE WILL BE LEFT  BEHIND ANYMORE.   I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE  THIS MOMENT TO SEND OUR THOUGHTS  AND PRAYERS TO EVERYONE AT THE  AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN KABUL,  AFGHANISTAN. THEY ARE GOING THROUGH A LOT. WE MUST DEFEAT RADICAL ISLAMIC  TERRORISM.    ANYONE WHO ONE NAME OUR ENEMY IS NOT FIT TO LEAD OUR COUNTRY.   EIGHT YEARS OF OBAMA-  CLINTON POLICIES HAVE SACRIFICED OUR SAFETY AND UNDERMINED OUR FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE. OUR JOBS HAVE MOVED TO OTHER  COUNTRIES. ISLAMIC TERRORISM HAS SPREAD WITHIN OUR SHORES.  AN OPEN BORDER HAS THREATENED, TOTALLY THREATENED OUR SECURITY. THE ISSUES WE FACE IN AMERICA  ARE SIMILAR TO THE ISSUES FACED IN BRITAIN DURING THE REFERENDUM ON MEMBERSHIP IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. THIS IS THE MOVEMENT KNOWN AS  BREXIT. ON JUNE 23, THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN VOTED TO DECLARE THEIR INDEPENDENCE, WHICH IS  WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO ALSO,  FOLKS.   FROM THE INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH  HAS NOT WORKED. THEY VOTED TO BREAK AWAY BY  LARGE CORPORATIONS AND MEDIA EXECUTIVES WHO BELIEVE IN A WORLD WITHOUT BORDERS. THEY VOTED TO RECLAIM CONTROL OVER IMMIGRATION, OVER THEIR  ECONOMY, THEIR GOVERNMENT. WORKING PEOPLE AND THE GREAT  PEOPLE OF THE UK TOOK CONTROL OF THEIR DESTINY.   THE PEOPLE PROFITING FROM THE RIGGED SYSTEM, AND IT IS RIGGED, THE MULTINATIONAL BANK, THE MEDIA CELEBRITIES,  TRYING TO SCARE THE BRITISH  PEOPLE OUT OF VOTING FOR CHANGE. THE SAME DAY IS HAPPENING RIGHT  HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.  IT IS HAPPENING.  ALL THE PEOPLE BENEFITING FROM  OUR RIGGED SYSTEM DO NOT WANT  THINGS TO CHANGE. THEY WANT YOU TO BELIEVE THINGS  CANNOT BE CHANGED, AND THEY CAN SO EASILY, AND SO SMARTLY.  WE ALL KNOW THINGS HAVE TO CHANGE.  WE HAVE NO CHOICE. THEY HAVE TO CHANGE RIGHT NOW.   BEFORE THE VOTE, I  SAID THAT BRITAIN WOULD LEAVE  THE EU. SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS THE  EUROPEAN UNION. AND I SAID IT. I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT WHEN I SAID IT. AND GUESS WHAT -- I WAS VERY  SUPPORTIVE OF THEIR RIGHT TO DO IT AND TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR FUTURE, LIKE WHAT WE ARE GOING  TO BE DOING ON NOVEMBER 8.   HILLARY CLINTON HAS  BEEN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY IN EVERY MAJOR DECISION. SHE HAS ONLY MADE BAD DECISIONS. SHE DOESN'T KNOW KNOW SHE IS DOING, FOLKS. SHE GOT THIS ONE WRONG, TOO.    SHE GOT THIS ONE  WRONG, TOO, FOLKS. SHE GETS THEM ALL ALL. SHE GETS THEM ALL WRONG. SHE GOT THE E-MAILS WRONG. AND NOW HILLARY WANTS TO SURRENDER AMERICA TO GLOBALISM. JUST WHAT WE DO NOT WANT. SHE WANTS A COUNTRY WITHOUT BORDERS. SHE WANTS DEALS WRITTEN FOR THE BENEFIT FOREIGN CORPORATIONS. SHE WANTS THE GOVERNMENT THAT  IGNORES THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. SHE WANTS TO SEELLL OUT AMERICAN SECURITY TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION FOR A DAY PILE OF  CASH. IT IS HARD TO TELL WITH THE  CLINTON FOUNDATION ENDS AND WHERE THE STATE DEPARTMENT BEGINS. ACCORDING TO THE ASSOCIATED  PRESS, MORE THAN HALF THE MEETING SHE TOOK AS SECRETARY OF STATE WITH PEOPLE OUTSIDE  GOVERNMENT WERE WITH FOUNDATION  DONORS.   HILLARY CLINTON DOES  NOT BELIEVE IN AMERICA FIRST. WE BELIEVE IN AMERICA FIRST.   HILLARY BELIEVES IIN N DONORS FIRST AND SPECIAL INTERESTS AND LOBBYISTS.  SHE WILL NEVER STRAIGHTEN OUT  OUR COUNTRY. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH, THE STAMINA, OR THE ABILITY TO STRAIGHTEN OUT OUR COUNTRY.  WE WILL HAVE FOUR MORE YEARRS OFS OF OBAMA, AND THAT IS WHAT WE DO  NOT WANT. SHE WOULD RATHER GET A JOB TO A  REFUGEE FROM OVERSEAS THAN AN UNEMPLOYED AMERICAN VETERAN, OR TWO AN UNEMPLOYED AFRICAN-AMERICAN OR AND HISPANIC.   THE JOB OF A PUBLIC  OFFICIAL IS TO SERVE AND PROTECT  THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES.   NOT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, NOT FOREIGN NATIONALS SEEKING ENTRY, BUT THE  PEOPLE LIVING HERE TODAY INCLUDING MILLIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND THE SPANISH CITIZENS -- AND HSISPANIC CITIZENS. MILLIONS. MILLIONS. BEING TREATED VERY UNFAIRLY. MY FOCUS WILL ALWAYS BE ON THE WELL-BEING OF MORE THAN 300  MILLION AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO CALL THIS COUNTRY HOME AND WHO LOVE THEIR COUNTRY.   I WILL FIGHT FOR THEIR SECURITY AND FOR THEIR JOBS. WE WILL NOT LET JOBS BE TAKEN  OUT OF OUR COUNTRY, BE RIPPED  OUT OF OUR COUNTRY AND MOVED TO MEXICO AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES. WE WILL NOT LET IT HAPPEN ANYMORE.   WE WILL BE FIGHTING FOR THEIR JOBS AND FOR YOUR FAMILIES. THAT, I CAN TELL YOU. IT ENDS WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON ON NOVEMBER 8.   WE WILL HAVE ONE AMERICAN NATION, NOT DIVIDED. WILL BE TOGETHER. HILLARY CLINTON HAS BETRAYED HER  DUTIES TO THE PEOPLE. NOVEMBER 8 IS OUR CHANCE TO READ DECLARE AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE.   THIS IS A GREAT HONOR FOR ME. I AM GOING RIGHT NOW TO INVITE ONTO THE STAGE THE MAN BEHIND BREXIT AND A MAN WHO LEAD BRILLIANTLY THE UNITED KINGDOM  INDEPENDENCE PARTY IN THIS FIGHT AND WON DESPITE ALL ODDS, THIS FIGHT HORRIBLE NAME-CALLING,  DESPITE SO MANY OBSTACLES.  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MR. NIGEL BARAGE.    WOW. THANK YOU, NIGEL. WHAT A JOB.  WHAT A JOB HE DID. THANK YOU, NIGEL. THAT WAS SOME JOB THAT HE DID, AGAINST ALL ODDS. EVERYBODY SAID IT COULDN'T BE  DONE. IT IS BE LIKE A VERY WISE DECISION. I REALLY CONGRATULATE NIGEL. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. IF I MAY, WE HAD SOME TREMENDOUS POLLS COME OUT TODAY. I REFUSED TO MENTION IT, THAT THEY ARE VERY GOOD. WE'RE LEAVING IN A LOT OF LOCATIONS. THANK YOU. IT IS TIME FOR AMERICA TO RECAPTURE LIKE YOU JUST HEARD, TO RECAPTURE OUR DESTINY. OUR GOVERNMENT LEADERS AND OUR MEDIA HAVE TOTALLY LOST TOUCH  WITH PEOPLE. THEY HAVE. UNIQUE NO BETTER EVIDENCE OF THAT THAN THE FACT THAT THE  MEDIA IGNORES THE PLAY OF  AMERICANS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR CHILDREN TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS,  BUT SPENDS DAY AFTER DAY PUSHING  FOR AMNESTY FOR THOSE HERE IN  TOTAL VIOLATION OF THE LAW.  WE CANNOT ALLOW THAT THAT. WHY DO OUR LEADERS FIGURE OUT   TO HELP THOSE THAT ARE HERE ILLEGALLY?  AND THEY SPEND AND THEY WORK AND THEY TRY SO HARD TO HELP THEM BUT THEY DON'T TRY HELPING   AMERICAN CITIZENS, SOME OF WHOM HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEIR CHILDREN AND   THEIR FAMILIES. DEVASTATED. MY PRIORITIES WILL NEVER CHANGE. JOBS, WAGES AND SECURITY FOR AMERICANS. ANY IMMIGRATION POLICY I SUPPORT AS PRESIDENT MUST PASS   THESE THREE TESTS. FIRST, IT MUST IMPROVE JOBS AND   WAGES FOR UNITED STATES CITIZENS.   WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WHO ARE MAKING REAL MONEY IN WAGES 18 YEARS AGO, WERE NOT WORKING   AS HARD AS THEY'RE WORKING NOW, AND THEY'VE GOTTEN OLDER, NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY.  AND IN MANY CASES, AND LARGELY   BECAUSE OF THE DISASTER KNOWN AS OBAMACARE, THEY HAVE TO HOLD TWO JOBS, NOT ONE, BUT TWO JOBS.   AND IN SOME CASES, THREE JOBS.  NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, FOLKS.   NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.  PLUS IT MUST IMPROVE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY FOR UNITED STATES CITIZENS.   THIRD, IT MUST IMPROVE THE   QUALITY OF LIFE FOR U.S.   CITIZENS, THE QUALITY OF LIFE. OUR QUALITY OF LIFE IS GOING DOWN.   OUR LEVEL OF SECURITY.  YOU LOOK BACK YEARS, YOU'RE   MORE INSECURE NOW IN TERMS OF SECURITY THAN YOU WERE 10, 15   AND 20 YEARS AGO. HILLARY CLINTON'S RADICAL   IMMIGRATION PLAN FAILS THESE TESTS, AND IT FAILS THEM VERY, VERY BADLY. HER PUSH FOR OPEN BORDERS WILL   LOWER THE WAGES AND KILL THE   JOBS OF LAWFUL AMERICAN RESIDENTS.  HER SUPPORT FOR CATCH AND RELEASE WILL PUT INNOCENT   AMERICAN LIVES AT RISK AND   ALREADY HAS. JUST LIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA RELEASED THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT AT THE BORDER WHO THEN KILLED MAGNIFICENT, MAGNIFICENT SARAH   ROOT. YESTERDAY I MET WITH HER MOM, MICHELLE.   HILLARY CLINTON ONLY TALKS ABOUT THE SEPARATION OF FAMILIES WHO CHOOSE TO COME HERE ILLEGALLY. I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE AMERICAN FAMILY WHO HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY SEPARATED FROM   THEIR CHILDREN BECAUSE OF THE SANCTUARY CITIES AND OPEN BORDERS THAT HILLARY CLINTON SO STRONGLY SUPPORTS. WHERE IS THE SANCTUARY FOR   AMERICAN CHILDREN? WHERE IS THAT SANCTUARY? THE DREAMERS WE NEVER TALK ABOUT ARE THE YOUNG AMERICANS. WHY AREN'T YOUNG AMERICANS DREAMERS, ALSO? I WANT MY DREAMERS TO BE YOUNG AMERICANS.  HILLARY CLINTON ALSO WANTS TO   PUSH TO BRING IN 620,000 REFUGEES IN HER FIRST TERM, A LARGE NUMBER OF WHOM COME FROM   COUNTRIES WHERE WOMEN AND GAYS   ARE HORRIBLY BRUTALIZED, WHICH   WILL WEAKEN OUR TOLERANT WAY OF LIFE.   I ONLY WANT TO BRING PEOPLE TO OUR COUNTRY WHO SHARE OUR   VALUES AND LOVE OUR PEOPLE AND   ARE CAPABLE OF LOVING AMERICA.  IMPORTANTLY, I WILL ALSO CREATE   MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF JOBS FOR OUR PEOPLE. WE ARE GOING TO CUT TAXES, REDUCE REGULATIONS, FIX OUR   TRADE DEALS, UNLEASH AMERICAN ENERGY, AND REPEAL AND REPLACE THE HORROR SHOW KNOWN AS OBAMACARE.  WE ARE GOING TO CREATE JOBS, JOBS, JOBS.   I WILL BE THE GREATEST JOBS PRESIDENT THAT GOD EVER CREATED.  BELIEVE ME.   SO WE'LL HAVE MILLIONS AND   MILLIONS OF JOBS, JOBS LIKE   YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IN THIS   COUNTRY BEFORE BECAUSE OUR JOBS   ARE BEING STOLEN FROM US, OUR   COMPANIES ARE BEING STOLEN FROM US, OUR MANUFACTURING IS DOWN BY 40% AND 50% AND NUMBERS THAT   NOBODY EVEN BELIEVES. THOSE DAYS WILL BE OVER IF   DONALD TRUMP IS ELECTED   PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.   BELIEVE ME. HIGHER INCOME, NEW WAGES, COMPANIES ALL ACROSS THIS NATION WILL COME IN AND FORM.   WE ARE GOING TO RENEGOTIATE THE   WORST TRADE DEAL EVER MADE NOT   ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY BUT   ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD KNOWN AS NAFTA AND SIGNED BY BILL CLINTON.  WE'RE GOING TO STAND UP TO   CHINA ON TRADE.   WE'RE GOING TO KEEP OUT OF WHAT   WILL BE A DISASTROUS TRADE DEAL. TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. T.P.P. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN WITH ME.   IT WILL ABSOLUTELY HAPPEN WITH   CROOKED HILLARY.  BELIEVE ME. THIS STATE HAS LOST MORE THAN 40% OF ITS MANUFACTURING JOBS SINCE BILL CLINTON SIGNED   NAFTA, AND IT'S LOST ONE IN FOUR MANUFACTURING JOBS SINCE   HE PUT CHINA INTO THE WORLD   TRADE ORGANIZATION. BOTH DEALS SUPPORTED BY HILLARY   CLINTON. HORRIBLE DEALS, DESTRUCTIVE   DEALS. WHAT THOSE DEALS HAVE DONE TO OUR JOBS AND TO OUR COUNTRY.  WE ARE GOING TO BRING BACK JOBS   TO MISSISSIPPI. AND IN NORTH CAROLINA, WHICH   HAS TREATED ME SO WELL. AND OHIO. AND TO MICHIGAN WHERE OUR AUTO PLANTS ARE LEAVING AND LEAVING AND LEAVING AND GOING TO MEXICO   AND OTHER PLACES. AND TO PENNSYLVANIA WHERE I WENT TO SCHOOL AND TO MARYLAND AND ALL ACROSS THIS LAND WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUR JOBS BACK   AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET OUR JOBS BE TAKEN AWAY.

BEAUTIFUL.  THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. I AM THRILLED TO BE WITH YOU TODAY IN TAMPA.  AS YOU KNOW, FLORIDA IS MY  SECOND HOME. THE PLACE I LOVE. IT IS AN AMAZING STATE AND IT IS  FILLED WITH SO MANY INCREDIBLE  PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY I LIKE IT. PEOPLE.  FOR THE NEXT 75 DAYS, WE'RE  GOING TO HAVE TO WORK VERY HARD TO GATHER TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE -- TOGETHER TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE ON NOVEMBER 8. WE JUST HAD A GREAT PULL COME OUT FROM FLORIDA UNIVERSITY  ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO THAT WE  ARE LEADING BY TWO POINTS.  OUR VICTORY IN NOVEMBER WILL BE A VICTORY FOR THE PEOPLE.  FOR THE PEOPLE. IT WON'T BE A VICTORY FOR THE PUNDITS.  IT WON'T BE FOR THE SPECIAL INTERESTS THAT PUT UP ALL THAT  HILLARY MONEY.  IT WILL NOT BE FOR THE FAILED POLITICIANS. IT WILL BE A VICTORY FOR YOU.  AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY, FOR YOUR FAMILY, YOUR COUNTRY. IT WILL BE A VICTORY FOR JOBS, JOBS, JOBS. WE ARE TO BRING OUR COMPANIES  BACK. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE DOUBTS BACK  IN THIS COUNTRY AGAIN. -- JOBS BACK IN THIS COUNTRY AGAIN.  MANUFACTURING IS DOWN 40%. COMPANIES ARE NOT GOING TO LEAVE  OUR COUNTRY SO EASILY. IT WILL BE -- THERE WILL BECAUSE  THE QANTAS WHEN THEY DO. -- CONSEQUENCES WHEN THEY DO. IT WILL BE A VICTORY FOR  SECURITY AND PROSPERITY. IT WILL BE A VICTORY FOR  AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE. WE WILL REJECT THE FAILURES OF THE PAST AND CREATE A NEW AMERICAN FUTURE WHERE EVERY JOB -- AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HISPANICS, ALL CHILDREN CAN LIVE OUT THEIR DREAMS TOGETHER IN PEACE AND  SAFETY.  WE WILL BRING BACK OUR JOBS.  WE WILL REBUILD OUR DEPLETED MILITARY.  WE LOVE OUR MILITARY. IT HAS BEEN SO BADLY DEPLETED. AT A TIME WHEN WE NEEDED JUST ABOUT THE MOST EVER. -- NEED IT JUST A ABOUT THE  MOST EVER. WE ARE GOING TO REBUILD IT.  WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR  GREAT VETERANS. THEY HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND.  WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR  GREAT VETERANS. WE ARE GOING TO UNLEASH AMERICAN ENERGY, RESTORE LAW AND ORDER.  AND WE WILL MAKE GOVERNMENT  HONEST ONCE AGAIN. WHICH IT IS NOT RIGHT NOW.  THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION  COULD NOT BE HIGHER. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO RAISE  TAXES VERY SUBSTANTIALLY AND  SEND JOBS TO OTHER COUNTRIES. THAT IS WHAT SHE WAS DOING. -- WANTS TO DO.  WE ARE GOING TO CUT TAXES  DRAMATICALLY. WE WILL BRING THOUSANDS OF NEW  COMPANIES AND MILLIONS OF NEW  JOBS TO OUR SHORES.  THAT IS SOMETHING I LOOK SO LORD -- SO FORWARD TO DOING. NO ONE CAN DO JOBS LIKE TRUMP. IF YOU LOOK AT FLORIDA, SO MANY JOBS WE HAVE ON THE BEACH, WE HAVE SO MANY JOBS IN THE STATE  OF FLORIDA. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, THOSE  PEOPLE LOVE WHAT WE HAVE DONE  FOR THEM. HIGH WAGES, GREAT WAGES, -- GREAT JOBS, HEALTH CARE. WE TAKE CARE OF OUR PEOPLE. WE ARE NOT DOING THAT RIGHT NOW  FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO PASS MORE TERRIBLE TRADE DEALS LIKE  THE TRANSPACIFIC OWNERSHIP. -- PARTNERSHIP. WE ARE GOING TO STOP THE TPP. TOTALLY RENEGOTIATE NAFTA.  ONE OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS  EVER MADE BY MANKIND. AND PROTECT EVERY LAST AMERICAN JOB. WE ARE GOING TO PROTECTOR JOBS.  THEY WILL NOT BE DISAPPEARING ANYMORE. PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, 18 YEARS AGO, WERE MAKING MORE MONEY AND WAGES -- IN WAGES THAT THEY ARE  MAKING TODAY. MANY ARE WORKING HARDER NOW AND  THEY ARE WORKING TWO JOBS.  THEY ARE GETTING OLDER, THEY ARE WORKING HARDER AND THEY ARE  MAKING LESS. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITH ME.  OF COURSE, I'M WORKING HARDER  ALSO.  THAT'S FOR SURE. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO EXPAND THE JOB KILLING REGULATIONS DESTROYING SMALL BUSINESS IN  AMERICA. REGULATIONS ARE OUT OF CONTROL IN THIS COUNTRY. WE'RE GOING TO CANCEL EVERY NEEDLESS JOB KILLING REGULATION  AND PUT A MORATORIUM ON NEW REGULATIONS UNTIL OUR ECONOMY  GETS BACK ON ITS FEET AND EVEN THEN, THEY WILL NOT BE BROUGHT BACK.  WE NEED SAFETY, WE NEED A LITTLE  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, WE  WANT CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER,  BUT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE ON TOP  OF THAT HAS BEEN INSANE. IT IS KILLING OUR BUSINESSES AND  DOES NOT ALLOW OUR BUSINESSES TO COMPETE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. YOU ARE LOSING YOUR JOBS. WE WILL CREATE GREAT NUMBERS OF  AMERICAN JOBS. BEYOND ANYTHING YOU HAVE EVER  WITNESSED.  I WILL BE THE GREATEST JOBS PRESIDENT THAT GOD EVER CREATED.  THE GREATEST. AND SPEAKING OF JOBS, AND  SPEAKING OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE  GOING TO DO A GREAT JOB ON JOBS, EVANGELICALS, PEOPLE OF RELIGION , CHRISTIANS, JEWS, CATHOLICS, MUSLIMS, EVERYBODY. YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE. VOTE ON NOVEMBER 8.  THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON YOU CAN  VOTE FOR, DONALD TRUMP.  WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.  WE ARE GOING TO DO A GREAT JOB. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO PUT THE COAL MINERS AND STILL WORKERS  OUT OF WORK.  YOU HURT HER. YOU HURT HER. WE GOING TO LIFT RESTRICTIONS ON  ALL AMERICAN ENERGY AND WE ARE  GUILTY STAND UP TO FOUR AND  TEACHING WHICH IS WHAT THEY ARE  DOING. THAT THREATENS STEEL PRODUCTION  IN AMERICA. THEY ARE DUMPING ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY WANT OUR  STEEL TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS SO  THEY CAN MAKE STEEL FOR US IN  TAR JUST PLENTY. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. -- AND CHARGE AS PLENTY. -- US PLENTY.  NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.  HILLARY CLINTON WAS TO PUT  GOVERNMENT IN CHARGE OF HEALTH  CARE. -- WANTS TO PUT GOVERNMENT IN  CHARGE OF HEALTH CARE. THEY TRIED THAT IN VENEZUELA AND  DID NOT WORK. ARE YOU READY? WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE AND CREATE --  BY THE WAY, I HAVE TO TELL YOU,  IT DOLLARS GETS ONE OF THE MOST  INCREDIBLE APPLAUSE. THE BAR DINE WITH OBAMACARE. IT IS A DISASTER. -- PEOPLE ARE DYING WITH  OBAMACARE. THEY'RE TRYING TO MOVE THE DATE  BECAUSE IT IS AN ELECTION  CHANGING NUMBER, IT IS GOING TO BE CLOSE TO 50%, COULD EVEN BE MORE THAN THAT. THEY WANT TO MAKE IT IN  DECEMBER. OBAMACARE IS A DISASTER. IN THE GREAT STATE OF TEXAS,  THEY HAD ALMOST A 50% INCREASE GOING THROUGH BLUE CROSS, BLUE SHIELD. THE PEOPLE ARE FURIOUS.  YOU WILL HAVE MORE THAN THAT. IT IS NOT GOING TO WORK. REGARDLESS OF WHO BECOMES  PRESIDENT, IT IS DEAD. HE WILL TRY TO SAVE IT BY RAISING EVERYBODY'S TAXES. -- SHE WILL TRY TO SAVE IT BY  RAISING EVERYBODY'S TAXES. YOU CAN COME UP WITH A PLANT  THAT IS SO MUCH BETTER. -- WE WILL COME UP WITH A PLAN  THAT IS SO MUCH BETTER. WE WILL HAVE CHOICE AND  COMPETITION. THAT WILL MAKE IT WORK. IT WILL BE AMAZING TO WATCH. HILLARY CLINTON WEDNESDAY CAP CHILDREN -- WANTS TO TRAP  CHILDREN IN FAILING SCHOOLS. I WANT SCHOOL CHOICE. I WANT CHARTER SCHOOLS AND MERIT  PAY FOR OUR GREAT TEACHERS. WE SHOULD HAVE MERIT PAY. NOBODY MORE IMPORTANT THAN A  TEACHER.  WE SHOULD HAVE MERIT PAY FOR THOSE TEACHERS. WE ARE GOING TO PUT OUR KIDS  ONTO THE LATTER OF SUCCESS. THAT IS A GOOD EDUCATION AND BEEN A GREAT JOB. -- THEN A GREAT JOB.  THIS IS SO IMPORTANT FOR OUR INNER CITIES. OUR INNER CITIES ARE SUFFERING  LIKE NEVER BEFORE. THEY HAVE BEEN RUN BY DEMOCRATS  FOR SO MANY YEARS. ALMOST EVERY INNER CITY IS RUN BY THE DEMOCRATS. NEARLY FOUR IN 10 AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN LIVE IN POVERTY. THE GATE PERCENT OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH -- 58% OF  AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTH ARE NOT  EMPLOYED. MORE THAN 2700 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOT IN CHICAGO SINCE THE  BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. NOT A LONG TIME. HOMICIDES ARE UP NEARLY 50% IN WASHINGTON DC AND MORE THAN 60% IN BALTIMORE.  THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS RUN NEARLY EVERY INNER CITY IN THIS COUNTRY FOR 50-100 YEARS. OVER 100 YEARS. THEY PRODUCE ONLY MORE POVERTY,  ONLY MORE CRIME, ONLY MORE JOBLESSNESS AND BROKEN HOMES ALL OVER THE PLACE. TO THOSE SUFFERING AND HURTING,  AND THE PEOPLE LEFT BEHIND, I SAY, VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.  WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? IT CANNOT GET ANY WORSE. I'M GOING TO FIX IT.  BELIEVE ME. TO BE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS, GREAT PEOPLE, TO THE HISPANIC VOTERS WHO HAVE BEEN TREATED TERRIBLY, I SAY, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? WHAT? I WILL FIX IT. I WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT  WHEN YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET IN  YOUR INNER CITY OR WHEREVER YOU  ARE, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE SHOT. YOUR CHILD IS NOT GOOD TO BE  SHOT. LAST NIGHT, I BROUGHT SOME  INCREDIBLE FAMILIES UP ON STAGE  WITH ME. PEOPLE THAT LOST THEIR CHILD TO  ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. PEOPLE WHOSE CHILD HAS BEEN  KILLED. PEOPLE WHO LOVE LOST CHILDREN. DEVASTATED, CAN NEVER BE THE  SAME. PEOPLE THAT CAME INTO THE  COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. WE'RE GOING TO FIX THAT PROBLEM. THEY GO TO FIX OUR INNER CITIES. -- WE ARE GOING TO FIX OUR INNER  CITIES. TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN PARENTS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO WALK DOWN THE STREET UP CITY WITHOUT  HAVING YOUR CHILD OR SELF SHOT. THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING.  TO THE HISPANIC PARENTS, YOU  HAVE A RIGHT TO WALK OUTSIDE  WITHOUT BEING SHOT.  YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO GOOD EDUCATION FOR YOUR CHILD.  YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO OWN YOUR HOME.  YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE A GOOD JOB. THE DEMOCRATS AND HILLARY CLINTON POLICIES -- IF SHE GETS YOUR VOTE, I THINK WE WILL DO GREAT WITH APT AMERICANS AND  HISPANICS. ONCE -- AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND  HAS BEEN SPARED ONCE SHE GETS YOUR VOTE, -- AND HISPANICS. ONCE SHE GETS YOUR VOTE, SHE  WILL SAY GOODBYE AND THEN COME  BACK FOUR YEARS FROM NOW. I'M ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE SO THAT I CAN FIGHT FOR YOU. AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS AND ALL AMERICANS. WE WILL MAKE IT BETTER.  HISPANIC CITIZENS HAVE BEEN SUFFERING UNDER THIS PRESIDENT TOO.SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA  CAME INTO OFFICE, ANOTHER  KILLING HISPANICS -- 2 MILLION  HISPANICS HAVE JOINED THE RANKS  OF OPERATIVE. -- POVERTY.  I WANT YOU TO JOIN THE RANKS OF  PEOPLE MAKING PHENOMENAL  LIVINGS.  THE NUMBER OF HISPANIC CHILDREN  LIVING IN POVERTY INCREASED BY 18% -- 15%. I'M GOING TO FIGHT TO GIVE  EVERY HISPANIC CITIZEN AND MUCH BETTER FUTURE, AND MUCH BETTER  LIFE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN  WHAT IS HAPPENING, OVER THE LAST THREE WEEKS, THE POLLS WITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND SPANISH-SPEAKING FOLKS, LATINOS,  AND THEY HAVE GONE WAY UP.  AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE TIRED OF BEING USED BY THESE PHONY POLITICIANS. HISPANICS ARE TIRED OF BEING  USED BY THESE PHONY POLITICIANS. EVERYBODY ELSE IN THIS COUNTRY IS TIRED OF BEING USED BY THESE PHONY POLITICIANS.  PART OF THAT BETTER FUTURE MEANS SECURING OUR BORDER. PROTECT THE JOBS OF ALL OF THE  PEOPLE LIVING HERE TODAY, AND THAT INCLUDES AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANIC AMERICANS AND ALL  AMERICANS.  WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT YOUR JOB.  HE WILL BRING SAFETY. BUT WE WILL -- WE WILL BRING  SAFETY. BUT WE WILL PROTECT YOUR JOBS. HILLARY CLINTON WAS TO HAVE A  TOTALLY OPEN BORDER WHERE PEOPLE  CAN COME IN AND TAKE YOUR JOB. WE'RE GOING TO ENFORCE OUR LAWS. REMOVE PEOPLE WHO OVERSTAY THEIR VISAS, DISMANTLE THE GANGS AND CARTELS, AND PROTECT JOBS AND BENEFITS FOR HARD-WORKING  AMERICAN CITIZENS.  AND MANY OF THEM ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND MANY OF  THEM ARE HISPANIC. WE WILL PROTECT YOUR JOBS. THAT INCLUDES PROTECTING THE JOBS AND WAGES OF HISPANICS LIVING HERE, SO MANY LIVING HERE IN FLORIDA. THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE NEXT DAY  THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A JOB  BECAUSE THE PEOPLE FLOWING IN A LEGALLY TO THIS DAY. THEY DESERVE TO HAVE THEIR JOBS PROTECTED FROM ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND BROKEN VISA PROGRAMS. ALL AMERICANS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR JOBS PROTECTED. HILLARY CLINTON WOULD RATHER  GIVE A JOB TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT  THAN TO AN UNEMPLOYED HISPANIC CITIZEN, UNEMPLOYED AFRICAN-AMERICAN CITIZEN, OR  EVEN A VETERAN. BELIEVE ME. IT IS GOING TO BE AMERICA FIRST FROM NOW ON.   THANK YOU. AT THE CORE","Donald Trump Campaign Rally in Tampa, Florida"

I JUST MET WITH OUR MANY AMAZING EMPLOYEES RIGHT UP THE ROAD AT  OUR PROPERTY.  I CAN TELL YOU, THEY LIKE YOU VERY MUCH. I GUESS I PAY THEM A LITTLE TOO  MUCH.  I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO  TALK ABOUT THE HEARTBREAK AND DEVASTATION IN LOUISIANA, A  STATE THAT IS VERY, VERY SPECIAL TO ME. WE ARE ONE NATION. WHEN ONE STATE HURTS, WE OFFER. WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO LIST EACH OTHER UP. WORKING, BUILDING, RESTORING  TOGETHER. OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES, AND WE SEND THEM OUR  DEEPEST CONDOLENCES. THE WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS THE  SADNESS THAT ONE FEELS AT TIMES  LIKE THIS.  I HOPE EVERYONE IN THE REAR ZANA -- IN LOUISIANA KNOWS WE ARE  PRAYING FOR THEM AND STANDING  WITH THEM TO HELP THEM IN THESE DIFFICULT HOURS.  THEY ARE VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.  THANK YOU.  WE ARE ONE COUNTRY, ONE PEOPLE,  AND WE WILL HAVE TOGETHER ONE GREAT FANTASTIC FUTURE. TOGETHER I WOULD LIKE TO TALK  ABOUT THE NEW AMERICAN FUTURE THAT WE ARE GOING TO CREATE AS  THE TWO TOGETHER. LAST WEEK, I LAID OUT MY PLAN TO BRING JOBS BACK TO OUR COUNTRY. THEY ARE VANISHING, AND  VANISHING QUICKLY. ON MONDAY, I LAID OUT MY PLAN TO DEFEAT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM.  ON TUESDAY, IN WISCONSIN, I  TALKED ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO RESTORE LAW AND ORDER TO THIS  COUNTRY. WE NEED LAW AND ORDER. WITHOUT IT, WE HAVE NOTHING. LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO  EXTEND OUR THANKS AND GRATITUDE  TO THE POLICE AND LAW  ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN THIS  COUNTRY WHO HAVE SACRIFICED SO GREATLY IN THESE VERY DIFFICULT  TIMES. THEY ARE THE CORPORATE THE CHAOS  AND VIOLENCE ON OUR STREETS AND THE ASSAULT ON LAW ENFORCEMENT  ARE REALLY AND TRULY AN ATTACK AGAINST ALL PEACEFUL CITIZENS. IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT, THIS  CHAOS AND LENTIL AND IN IT WILL  END VERY, VERY QUICKLY. EVERY SINGLE CITIZEN IN OUR LAND  HAS THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN SAFETY. TO BE ONE UNITED NATION WE MUST PROTECT ALL OF OUR PEOPLE.  ALL OF OUR PEOPLE. BUT, WE MUST ALSO PROVIDE  OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL OF OUR  PEOPLE. WE CANNOT MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IF WE LEAVE ANY COMMUNITY BEHIND. NEARLY FOUR IN 10 AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE  LIVING IN POVERTY.  I WILL NOT BEST REST UNTIL CHILDREN  OF EVERY COLOR IN THIS COUNTRY  ARE FULLY INCLUDED IN THE AMERICAN DREAM. JOBS, SAFETY, OPPORTUNITY IS  WHAT WE HAVE TO HAVE AND WHAT WE NEED. FAIR AND IT WILL REPRESENTATION. THIS IS WHAT I PROMISED TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANICS, AMERICANS, OF ALL TYPES, COLORS,  AND RELIGIONS. THIS IS WHAT WE PROMISE.  THIS IS WHAT EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM PROMISES.  THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. TO ACHIEVE THIS NEW AMERICAN FUTURE, WE HAVE TO BREAK FROM  THE FAILURES OF THE PASS.  AS YOU KNOW, I'M NOT A  POLITICIAN. I WORKED IN BUSINESS, CREATED A GREAT COMPANY, BUILT A LOT OF JOBS.  THAT IS WHAT I HAVE DONE ALL OF MY ADULT LIFE. I'VE NEVER WANTED TO LEARN THE  LANGUAGE OF THE INSIDERS. I HAVE NEVER BEEN POLITICALLY  CORRECT. IT TAKES FAR TOO MUCH TIME.  TRUTHFULLY, IT TAKES FAR TOO MUCH TIME, AND CAN OFTEN MAKE IT  MORE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE TOTAL  VICTORY. SOMETIMES, IN THE HEAT OF  DEBATE, AND SPEAKING ON A  MULTITUDE OF ISSUES, YOU DO NOT CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORDS, OR YOU SAY THE WRONG THING. I HAVE DONE THAT. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I REGRET IT. I DO REGRET IT. PARTICULARLY WHEN IT MAY HAVE CAUSED PERSONAL PAIN. TOO MUCH IS AT STAKE FOR US TO BE CONSUMED BY THESE ISSUES.  ONE THING I CAN PROMISE YOU THIS.  I CAN ALWAYS TELL YOU THE TRUTH. I SPEAK THE TRUTH FOR ALL OF YOU  AND FOR EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY  WHO DOES NOT HAVE A VOICE, OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY. I SPEAK THE TRUTH ON THE HALF OF  THE FACTORY WORKER WHO LOST HIS  OR HER JOB AND THAT IS HAPPENING  MORE AND MORE IN OUR COUNTRY. I SPEAK THE TRUTH ON BEHALF OF THE VETERAN WHO HAS BEEN DENIED  THE MEDICAL CARE THEY NEED AND  THE MEDICAL CARE THEY DESERVE. SO MANY ARE NOT MAKING IT, BUT THEY WILL MAKE IT IF TRUMP  BECOMES PRESIDENT.  THAT, I CAN TELL YOU.  THEY ARE DYING IN LINES WAITING  FOR A DOCTOR. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR  VETERANS. I SPEAK THE TRUTH ON BEHALF OF THE FAMILIES LIVING NEAR THE BORDER THAT DESERVE TO BE SAFE  IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY, BUT IS  INSTEAD LIVING WITH NO SECURITY  AND NO PROTECTION AT ALL.  WE WILL BUILD THE WALL.  OUR CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT REPRESENTING THE GREAT MAJORITY OF AMERICANS. REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, INDEPENDENTS, CONSERVATIVES, AND LIBERALS WHO READ THE NEWSPAPER AND TURN ON THE TELEVISION AND  DID NOT HEAR ANYONE SPEAKING TO  THEM.  ALL THEY HEAR OUR INSIDERS FIGHTING FOR OV OTHER INSIDERS.  THAT IS WHAT THEY DO. THESE ARE THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR SOCIETY CAN THEY  ARE ANGRY AT SO MUCH AND ON SO  MANY LEVELS. THE POVERTY, THE UNEMPLOYMENT,  THE FAILING SCHOOLS, THE JOBS  MOVING TO OTHER COUNTRIES. I AM FIGHTING 50'S FORGOTTEN AMERICANS -- THESE FORGOTTEN AMERICANS.  14 MONTHS AGO I DECLARED MY CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENCY ON  THE PROMISE TO GIVE OUR GOVERNMENT BACK TO THE PEOPLE. EVERY DAY SINCE THEN, I HAVE WORKED TO REPAY THE LOYALTY AND THE FAITH THAT YOU PUT ME. EVERY DAY, I THINK ABOUT HOW  MUCH IS AT STAKE FOR OUR COUNTRY  IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION. THIS IS NOT JUST THE FIGHT OF MY LIFE, IT IS THE FIGHT OF OUR LIVES, TOGETHER, TO SAVE OUR  COUNTRY. I REFUSE TO LET ANOTHER GENERATION OF AMERICAN CHILDREN BE EXCLUDED FROM THE AMERICAN DREAM, WHICH IS WHAT IS  HAPPENING. OUR WHOLE COUNTRY LOSES WHEN  YOUNG PEOPLE OF LIMITLESS POTENTIAL ARE DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR TALENTS BECAUSE WE FAILED TO PROVIDE THEM THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY DESERVE. THAT OUR CHILDREN FEATURING MS.  TO -- BE DREAMERS TOO. OUR WHOLE COUNTRY LOSES EVERY TIME I COULD DOES NOT GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL ROAD FELLS TO ENTER THE WORKFORCE, OR WORSE STILL, IS LOST TO THE WORLD OF  DRUGS AND CRIME.  SO MANY ARE. SO, SO MANY. WHEN I LOOK AT THE FAILING  SCHOOLS, THE TERRIBLE TRADE  DEALS, THE INFRASTRUCTURE  CRUMBLING IN THE INNER CITIES, I  KNOW ALL OF THIS CAN BE FIXED, AND I CAN FIX IT, BUT I KNOW WE  CAN BE FIXED VERY, VERY QUICKLY  IF WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING. IN THE WORLD I COME FROM, IF  SOMETHING IS BROKEN, YOU FIX IT. IF SOMETHING IS NOT WORKING, YOU  REPLACE IT. IF A PRODUCT IS NOT DELIVER, YOU MAKE A CHANGE. I HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR GOVERNMENT INCOMPETENCE. THAT IS WHAT IT IS.  GROSS INCOMPETENCE.  AND, NO SYMPATHY FOR LEADERS WHO  FAIL THEIR CITIZENS. THAT IS WHY I'M RUNNING TO AND  THAT DECADES OF BITTER FAILURE  AND OFFER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE A  NEW FUTURE OF HONESTY, JUSTICE, AND OPPORTUNITY. A FUTURE WHERE AMERICA AND ITS PEOPLE ALWAYS, AND I MEAN, ALWAYS, COMES FIRST.  AMERICA FIRST. REMEMBER.  AMERICA FIRST. AREN'T YOU TIRED OF A SYSTEM THAT GETS RICH, AND THIS IS A  SYSTEM THAT IS GETTING VERY RICH AT YOUR EXPENSE. AREN'T YOU TIRED OF THE SAME OLD LIES IN THE SAME OLD BROKEN  PROMISES? HILLARY CLINTON HAS PROVEN TO BE  ONE OF THE GREATEST LIARS OF ALL  TIME. AREN'T YOU TIRED OF ARROGANT  LEADERS WHO LOOK DOWN ON YOU  INSTEAD OF SERVING AND  PROTECTING YOU?  THAT IS ALL ABOUT TO CHANGE. IT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE VERY, VERY  SOON. HOW ABOUT NOVEMBER 8?  AFTER GOING TO PUT THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE FIRST AGAIN. IT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE VERY,I HAVE TRAVELED ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, LAYING OUT MY BOLD AND MODERN AGENDA FOR CHANGE.  I WILL NEVER LIE TO YOU.  I WILL NEVER TELL YOU SOMETHING I DO NOT BELIEVE.  I WILL NEVER PUT ANYONE'S  INTEREST AHEAD OF YOURS. AND, I WILL NEVER EVER STOP  FIGHTING FOR YOU. I HAVE NO SPECIAL INTEREST  CONTROLLING ME. I HAVE NO SPECIAL INTEREST. AND SPENDING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON MY OWN CAMPAIGN. I'M FUNDING MY OWN CAMPAIGN.  MY ONLY INTEREST IS THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE. I HAVE TRAVELED ALLTHIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN SO GOOD TO  ME. I'M GIVING BACK.  THAT IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT.  GIVING BACK. WHILE SOMETIMES I CAN BE TOO HONEST, HILLARY CLINTON IS THE  EXACT OPPOSITE.  SHE NEVER TELLS THE TRUTH. ONE MY AFTER ANOTHER, -- ONE LIE AFTER ANOTHER, AND GETTING WORSE WITH EACH PASSING DAY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE STILL  WAITING FOR HILLARY CLINTON TO APOLOGIZE TO THE PEOPLE SHE HAS THE TRADE AND PUT AT GREAT  DANGER TO THEM. HAS HILLARY EVER APOLOGIZED FOR  LYING ABOUT HER E-MAIL SERVER AND DELETING 30,000 IN MOST?  HAS HILLARY CLINTON APOLOGIZE  FOR MAKING THE STATE DEPARTMENT  OF PLAY FOR PAY OPERATION WHERE FAVORS ARE SOLD TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT IS  HAPPENING. HOW SHE APOLOGIZE FOR LYING TO  THE FAMILIES WHO LOST LOVED ONES AT BENGHAZI? HAS SHE APOLOGIZE FOR PUTTING IRAN ON A PATH FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS? HAS SHE APOLOGIZE FOR IRAQ? FOR LIBYA? FOR SYRIA?  HAS SHE APOLOGIZE FOR UNLEASHING ISIS ACROSS A WORLD? SHE AND BARACK OBAMA UNLEASHED  ISIS, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT, YOU  DON'T LIKE IT, WHETHER YOU WANT  TO HEAR IT, OR YOU DON'T, THAT  IS WHAT HAPPENED. HAS HILLARY CLINTON APOLOGIZED  FOR THE DECISIONS SHE MADE THAT  HAVE LED TO SO MUCH DEATH,  DESTRUCTION, AND TERRORISM? THE CABLE EYES, WE NOW KNOW FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT, JUST ANNOUNCED, THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA LIED ABOUT THE $400 MILLION IN CASH THAT WAS FLOWN TO IRAN. $400 MILLION IN CASH. HE DENIED IT WAS FOR THE  HOSTAGES, BUT IT WAS.  IT JUST CAME OUT. HE SAID, WE DO NOT PAY RANSOM,  BUT WE DID.  HE LIED ABOUT THE HOSTAGES OPENLY AND LATELY, JUST LIKE HE LIED ABOUT OBAMACARE. YOU REMEMBER, YOU CAN HAVE YOUR DOCTOR, YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PLAN.  IT DID NOT WORK OUT THAT WAY. NOW THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT  EVERY AMERICAN TRAVELING OVERSEAS, INCLUDING OUR MILITARY PERSONNEL, I GREATER RISK OF BEING -- AT GREATER RISK OF BEING KIDNAPPED.  PRESIDENT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY. HERE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL AND GREAT STATE, SO MANY PEOPLE HAD SUFFERED BECAUSE OF NAFTA.  NAFTA.  REMEMBER NAFTA, WHAT IT'S DONE   ON THIS COUNTRY.  BILL CLINTON SIGNED THE DEAL AND  HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTED THE DEAL.  NORTH CAROLINA HAS LOST NEARLY HALF OF ITS MANUFACTURING JOBS   SINCE NAFTA WENT INTO EFFECT.  BILL CLINTON ALSO PUT CHINA INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, ANOTHER HILLARY CLINTON-BACKED DISASTER. YOUR CITY OF CHARLOTTE HAS LOST 1/4 MANUFACTURING JOBS SINCE   CHINA JOINED THE WTO, AND MANY OF THESE JOBS WERE LOST WHILE HILLARY CLINTON WAS SECRETARY OF STATE  STATE.  OUR CHIEF DIPLOMAT WITH CHINA.  SHE WAS A DISASTER, TOTALLY   UNFIT FOR THIS JOB. TOTALLY UNFIT.  HILLARY CLINTON OWES THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA A VERY BIG APOLOGY, AND I THINK YOU'LL GET THAT APOLOGY AROUND THE SAME TIME YOU'LL GET TO SEE HER 33,000 DELETED E-MAILS. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'LL NEVER SEE THE APOLOGY.  ANOTHER MAJOR ISSUE IN THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN THE BORDER.  OUR OPEN BORDER HAS ALLOWED   DRUGS AND CRIME AND GANGS TO   POUR INTO OUR COUNTRY AND OUR COMMUNITIES.  SO MUCH NEEDLESS SUFFERING, SO MUCH PREVENTABLE DEATH.  I'VE SPENT TIME WITH THE FAMILIES OF WONDERFUL AMERICANS WHOSE LOVED ONES WERE KILLED BY   THE OPEN BORDERS AND SANCTUARY   CITIES THAT HILLARY CLINTON   SUPPORTS. I'VE EMBRACED CRYING PARENTS WHO  HAVE LOST THEIR CHILDREN TO VIOLENCE SPILLING ACROSS OUR BORDER. PARENTS LIKE LAURA WILKERSON, AND MICHELLE ROOD AND SABINE DURDIN AND MY FRIEND JAMILLE   SHAW WHOSE CHILDREN WERE KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SO NEEDLESSLY. MY OPPONENT SUPPORTS SANCTUARY CITIES.  BUT WHERE WERE THESE SANCTUARIES FOR KATE STANLEY? WHERE WERE THEY?   WHERE WERE THEY?   WHERE WAS IT?   WHERE WAS THE SANCTUARY FOR KATE? THINK ABOUT IT.  WHERE WAS THE SANCTUARY FOR THE CHILDREN OF LAURA AND MICHELLE AND SABINE AND JAMILLE?   WHERE WAS THE SANCTUARY TO EVERY  OTHER PARENT WHO HAS SUFFERED SO  HORRIBLY? THESE MOMS AND DADS DON'T GET A   LOT OF CONSIDERATION FROM OUR POLITICIANS.  THEY CERTAINLY DON'T GET APOLOGIES.  THEY'LL NEVER EVEN GET THE TIME   OF DAY FROM HILLARY CLINTON.  SHE DOESN'T EVEN CARE, I'M CONVINCED.  BUT THEY WILL ALWAYS COME FIRST TO ME.  LISTEN CLOSELY. WE WILL DELIVER JUSTICE FOR ALL   OF THESE GREAT AMERICAN FAMILIES.  WE WILL CREATE A SYSTEM OF   IMMIGRATION THAT MAKES US ALL PROUD.  HILLARY CLINTON'S MISTAKES   DESTROY INNOCENT LIVES, SACRIFICE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND  BETRAY THE WORKING FAMILIES OF   THIS COUNTRY.  I WILL NEVER PUT PERSONAL PROFIT BEFORE NATIONAL SECURITY.  NOBODY SHOULD.  I WILL NEVER LEAVE OUR BORDER OPEN TO APPEASE DONORS AND   SPECIAL INTERESTS, WHICH IS WHAT HILLARY IS DOING, AND THEY ARE DOING APPEASED. I WILL NEVER SUPPORT A TRADE DEAL THAT KILLS AMERICAN JOBS.    I WILL NEVER EVER PUT THE SPECIAL INTERESTS BEFORE THE   NATIONAL INTERESTS.  I WILL NEVER PUT A TONER BEFORE A VOTER OR A LOBBYIST BEFORE A CITIZEN.  INSTEAD, I WILL BE A CHAMPION   FOR THE PEOPLE.  THE ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA DOESN'T   COVER WHAT REALLY MATTERS IN   THIS COUNTRY OR WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. THEY WILL TAKE WORDS OF MINE OUT OF CONTEXT AND SPEND A WEEK   OBSESSING OVER EVERY SINGLE   SYLLABLE, AND THEN PRETEND TO DISCOVER SOME HIDDEN MEANING IN WHAT I SAID.  JUST IMAGINE FOR A SECOND IF THE  MEDIA SPENT THIS ENERGY HOLDING THE POLITICIANS ACCOUNTABLE WHO   GOT INNOCENT AMERICANS LIKE KATE STEINLY KILLED. SHE WAS GUNNED DOWN BY AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WHO HAD BEEN DEPORTED FIVE TIMES. JUST IMAGINE IF THE MEDIA SPENT TIME -- AND LOTS OF TIME INVESTIGATING THE POVERTY AND JOBLESSNESS OF THE INNER CITIES. JUST THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH   DIFFERENT THINGS WOULD BE IF THE MEDIA IN THIS COUNTRY SENT THEIR CAMERAS TO OUR BORDER, TO OUR CLOSING FACTORIES, OR TO OUR   FAILING SCHOOLS.  OR THE MEDIA FOCUSED ON WHAT   DARK SECRETS MUST BE HIDDEN IN THE 33,000 E-MAILS THAT HILLARY CLINTON ILLEGALLY DELETED.      THANK YOU. INSTEAD, EVERY STORY IS TOLD   FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE INSIDER. IT'S THE NARRATIVE OF THE PEOPLE  WHO RIGGED THE SYSTEM, NEVER THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE IT'S BEEN RIGGED AGAINST, BELIEVE ME.  SO MANY PEOPLE SUFFERING FOR SO   LONG IN SILENCE. NO CAMERAS, NO COVERAGE, NO OUTRAGE FROM THE MEDIA CLASS   THAT SEEMS TO GET OUTRAGED OVER   JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE. SO AGAIN, IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.  IT'S NEVER BEEN ABOUT ME.  IT'S BEEN ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO DON'T HAVE A VOICE. I AM RUNNING TO BE YOUR VOICE.      THANK YOU.  I AM RUNNING TO BE THE VOICE FOR EVERY FORGOTTEN PART OF THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS BEEN WAITING AND HOPING FOR A BETTER FUTURE.  I AM GLAD THAT I MAKE THE   POWERFUL -- AND I MEAN VERY POWERFUL -- A LITTLE   UNCOMFORTABLE NOW AND AGAIN, INCLUDING SOME OF THE POWERFUL PEOPLE, FRANKLY, IN MY OWN   PARTY. BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT I'M FIGHTING FOR REAL CHANGE, REAL CHANGE.  THERE'S A REASON HEDGE FUND MANAGERS, THE FINANCIAL LOBBYISTS, THE WALL STREET   INVESTORS, ARE THROWING THEIR MONEY ALL OVER HILLARY CLINTON,   BECAUSE THEY KNOW SHE WILL MAKE SURE THE SYSTEM STAYS RIGGED IN   THEIR FAVOR.  IT'S THE POWERFUL PROTECTING THE POWERFUL, THE INSIDERS FIGHTING   FOR THE INSIDERS. I AM FIGHTING FOR YOU.   ON  TERRORISM, WE ARE GOING TO END THE ERA OF NATION-BUILDING AND, INSTEAD, FOCUS ON DESTROYING, DESTROYING, DESTROYING ISIS AND RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM.  WE WILL USE MILITARY, CYBER, AND FINANCIAL WARFARE, AND WORK WITH  ANY PARTNER IN THE WORLD AND THE MIDDLE EAST THAT SHARES OUR GOAL OF DEFEATING TERRORISM.  I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR THE   TERRORISTS TRYING TO KILL OUR CITIZENS.  WE WILL FIND YOU.  WE WILL DESTROY YOU, AND WE WILL ABSOLUTELY WIN, AND WE WILL WIN SAO SOON.  ON IMMIGRATION, WE WILL TEMPORARILY SUSPEND IMMIGRATION FROM ANYPLACE WHERE ADEQUATE   SCREENING CANNOT BE PERFORMED. EXTREME VETTING.  REMEMBER, EXTREME VETTING. ALL APPLICANTS FOR IMMIGRATION   WILL BE VETTED FOR TIES TO RADICAL IDEOLOGY, AND WE WILL SCREEN OUT ANYONE WHO DOESN'T SHARE OUR VALUES AND LOVE OUR PEOPLE.  ANYONE WHO BELIEVES SHARIAH LAW SUPPLANTS AMERICAN LAW WILL NOT BE GIVEN AN IMMIGRANT VISA.  IF YOU WANT TO JOIN OUR SOCIETY,  THEN YOU MUST EMBRACE OUR   SOCIETY, OUR VALUES, AND OUR   TOLERANT WAY OF LIFE. THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN OPPRESSING WOMEN, GUYS, HISPANICS, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, AND PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT FAITHS, ARE NOT   WELCOME TO JOIN OUR GREAT COUNTRY.  WE WILL PROMOTE OUR AMERICAN VALUES, OUR AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE, AND OUR AMERICAN SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT.  WHICH ARE ALL THE BEST IN THE WORLD.  MY OPPONENT, ON THE OTHER HAND,   WANTS A 550% INCREASE IN SYRIAN REFUGEES, EVEN MORE THAN ALREADY POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA.  HER PLAN WOULD BRING IN ROUGHLY 620,000 REFUGEES FROM ALL REFUGEE-SENDING NATIONS IN HER FIRST TERM ALONE ON TOP OF ALL OTHER IMMIGRATION.  THINK OF THAT. THINK OF THAT. WHAT ARE WE DOING? HILLARY CLINTON IS RUNNING TO BE  AMERICA'S ANGELA MIRKLE.  AND WE'VE SEEN HOW MUCH CRIME   AND HOW MANY PROBLEMS THAT'S   CAUSED THE GERMAN PEOPLE AND GERMANY.  WE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS ALREADY. WE DO NOT NEED MORE.  ON CRIME, WE'RE GOING TO ADD MORE POLICE, MORE INVESTIGATORS, AND APPOINT THE BEST JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS IN THE WORLD.    WE WILL PURSUE STRONG ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL LAWS.  THE GANGS AND CARTELS AND CRIMINAL SYNDICATES TERRORIZING OUR PEOPLE WILL BE STRIPPED   APART ONE BY ONE, AND THEY'LL BE  SENT OUT OF OUR COUNTRY QUICKLY.  THEIR DAY IS OVER. AND IT'S GOING TO END VERY, VERY FAST. OUR TRADE -- THANK YOU. ON TRADE, WE'RE GOING TO RENEGOTIATE NAFTA, TO MAKE IT BETTER.  AND IF THEY DON'T AGREE, WE WILL WITHDRAW.  AND LIKE WISE, WE'RE GOING TO   WITHDRAW FROM TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP, ANOTHER DISASTER.  STAND UP TO CHINA ON OUR TERRIBLE TRADE AGREEMENTS AND PROTECT EVERY LAST AMERICAN JOB.  HILLARY CLINTON HAS SUPPORTED ALL OF THE MAJOR TRADE DEALS   THAT HAVE STRIPPED THIS COUNTRY   OF ITS JOBS AND ITS WEALTH.  WE OWE $20 TRILLION.  ON TAXES, WE ARE GOING TO   MASSIVELY CUT TAX RATES FOR   WORKERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES, CREATING MILLIONS OF NEW GOOD-PAYING JOBS.  WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF REGULATIONS THAT SEND JOBS   OVERSEAS, AND WE ARE GOING TO   MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOUNG   AMERICANS TO GET THE CREDIT THEY  NEED TO START A SMALL BUSINESS AND PURSUE THEIR DREAM.  ON EDUCATION, SO IMPORTANT, WE ARE GOING TO GIVE STUDENTS CHOICE AND ALLOW CHARTER SCHOOLS  TO THRIVE.  WE ARE GOING TO END 10-YEAR   POLICIES THAT REWARD BAD TEACH   ERS AND HURT OUR GREAT GOOD TEACHERS.  MY OPPONENT WANTS TO DENY STUDENTS CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY,  ALL TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY FROM THE EDUCATION BUREAUCRACY. SHE DOESN'T CARE HOW MANY YOUNG DREAMS ARE DASHED OR DESTROYED, AND THEY'RE DESTROYED.  YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DESTROYED BEFORE THEY EVEN START. WE ARE GOING TO WORK CLOSELY WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN PARENTS AND CHILDREN.  WE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH THE   PARENT STUDENTS.  WE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH   EVERYBODY IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, IN THE INNER CITIES, AND WHAT A BIG  DIFFERENCE THAT IS GOING TO MAKE.  IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I MOST   LOOK FORWARD TO DOING.  THIS MEANS A LOT TO ME AND IT IS  GOING TO BE A TOP PRIORITY IN A   TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.  ON HEALTHCARE, WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE THE DISASTER CALLED OBAMACARE.  COUNTLESS AMERICANS HAVE BEEN   FORCED INTO PART-TIME JOBS, PREMIUMS ARE ABOUT TO JUMP BY   DOUBLE DIGITS YET AGAIN.  AND JUST THIS WEEK, AETNA ANNOUNCED IT IS PULLING OUT OF   THE EXCHANGES ALL OVER, BUT ALSO IN NORTH CAROLINA. WE ARE GOING TO REPLACE THIS   DISASTER WITH REFORMS THAT GIVE YOU CHOICE AND FREEDOM AND CONTROL IN HEALTHCARE AT A MUCH, MUCH LOWER COST. YOU'LL HAVE MUCH BETTER   HEALTHCARE AT A MUCH LOWER COST. AND IT WILL HAPPEN QUICKLY.  ON POLITICAL CORRUPTION, WE ARE   GOING TO RESTORE HONOR TO OUR   GOVERNMENT. IN MY ADMINISTRATION, I'M GOING TO ENFORCE ALL LAWS CONCERNING   THE PROTECTION OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.  NO ONE WILL BE ABOVE THE LAW.  I AM GOING TO FORBID SENIOR OFFICIALS FROM TRADING FAVORS   FOR CASH BY PREVENTING THEM FROM  COLLECTING LAVISH SPEAKING FEES   THROUGH THEIR SPOUSES WHEN THEY SERVE.  I'M GOING TO ASK MY SENIOR   OFFICIALS TO SIGN AN AGREEMENT NOT TO ACCEPT SPEAKING FEES FROM CORPORATIONS WITH A REGISTERED LOBBYIST FOR FIVE YEARS AFTER LEAVING OFFICE, OR FROM ANY ENTITY TIED TO A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT.  FINALLY, WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER. IT IS SO DIVIDED.  WE ARE GOING TO BRING IT TOGETHER. WE ARE GOING TO DO IT BY EMPHASIZING WHAT WE ALL HAVE IN COMMON AS AMERICANS.  WE'RE GOING TO REJECT BIGOTRY,   AND I WILL TELL YOU THE BIGOTRY   OF HILLARY CLINTON IS AMAZING. SHE SEES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR,   ONLY AS VOTES, AND NOT AS HUMAN BEINGS.  WORTHY OF A BETTER FUTURE.  ONLY VOTES, IT IS ONLY VOTES THAT SHE SEES, AND SHE DOES   NOTHING ABOUT IT.  SHE'S BEEN THERE FOREVER, AND LOOK AT WHERE YOU ARE.  IF AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS GIVE   DONALD TRUMP A CHANCE BY GIVING   ME THEIR VOTE THE RESULT FOR   THEM WILL BE AMAZING. LOOK HOW BADLY THINGS ARE GOING UNDER DECADES OF DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP  LEADERSHIP. LOOK AT THE SCHOOLS.  LOOK AT THE POVERTY.  LOOK AT THE 58% OF YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICANS NOT WORKING. 58%.  IT IS TIME FOR A CHANGE. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE BY TRYING SOMETHING NEW?   I WILL FIX IT. WATCH.  I WILL FIX IT.  YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE,   NOTHING TO LOSE. IT IS SO BAD. THE INNER CITIES ARE SO BAD, YOU  HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.  THEY HAVE BEEN PLAYING WITH YOU FOR 60, 70, 80 YEARS, MANY   DECADES. YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.  I WILL DO A GREAT JOB.  THIS MEANS SO MUCH TO ME, AND I   WILL WORK AS HARD AS I CAN TO BRING NEW OPPORTUNITY TO PLACES   IN OUR COUNTRY WHICH HAVE NOT   KNOWN IT IN A VERY, VERY LONG TIME.  HILLARY CLINTON AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAVE TAKEN AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTES TOTALLY   FOR GRANTED. BECAUSE THE VOTES HAVE BEEN   AUTOMATICALLY THERE FOR THEM, THERE HAS BEEN NO REASON FOR   DEMOCRATS TO PRODUCE, AND THEY   HAVEN'T. THEY HAVEN'T PRODUCED IN DECADES AND DECADES. IT'S TIME TO BREAK WITH THE FAILURES OF THE PAST AND TO   FIGHT FOR EVERY LAST AMERICAN CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY TO HAVE A   BETTER AND A MUCH, MUCH BRIGHTER FUTURE. IN MY ADMINISTRATION, EVERY   AMERICAN WILL BE TREATED   EQUALLY, PROTECTED EQUALLY, AND HONORED EQUALLY. WE WILL REJECT BIGOTRY AND HATRED AND OPPRESSION AND ALL OF ITS FORMS AND SEEK A NEW FUTURE BUILT ON OUR COMMON CULTURE AND VALUES, AS ONE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS IS THE CHANGE I AM   PROMISING TO ALL OF YOU, AN   HONEST GOVERNMENT, A GREAT   ECONOMY, AND A JUST SOCIETY FOR   EACH AND EVERY AMERICAN.  BUT WE CAN NEVER EVER FIX OUR PROBLEMS BY RELYING ON THE SAME   POLITICIANS WHO CREATED THESE PROBLEMS IN THE FIRST PLACE. CAN'T DO IT. 72% OF VOTERS SAY OUR COUNTRY IS  ON THE WRONG TRACK.  I AM THE CHANGE CANDIDATE.  HILLARY CLINTON IS FOR THE   FAILED STATUS QUO, TO PROTECT   HER SPECIAL INTERESTS, HER   DONORS, HER LOBBYISTS, AND OTHERS.  IT IS TIME TO VOTE FOR A NEW AMERICAN FUTURE. TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN.  WE WILL MAKE AMERICA PROUD   AGAIN.  WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. FRIENDS AND FELLOW CITIZENS, COME NOVEMBER, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, AND GOD   BLESS YOU.  THANK YOU.       YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT   ","Donald Trump Campaign Rally in Charlotte, North Carolina"

WE ARE GOING TO BRING BACK OUR JOBS TO PENNSYLVANIA, WE ARE  GOING TO BRING BACK OUR JOBS TO  THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE GOING TO BRING BACK OUR  JOBS, FOLKS. I LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AND I'VE  SEEN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN PENNSYLVANIA, WAS HAPPENING ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. YOU LOOK AT YOUR STATE, NEW  ENGLAND, ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY WE WANT TO GO TO, ALL OVER, IT  IS THE SAME, MANUFACTURING WAY DOWN, JOBS WAY DOWN.  YOU GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES, THEY  ARE TAKING OUR COMPANIES. THEY ARE TAKING OUR JOBS. PEOPLE ARE RIGHT NOW WORKING  HARDER THAN IT EVER WORKED ON 18  YEARS AGO, THEY MADE MORE MONEY  IN REAL WAGES -- 18 YEARS AGO,  MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS  INCREDIBLY BIG ROOM -- THANK YOU  FOR BEING HERE. YOU KNOW, IS 93 DEGREES OUT.   AND THEY STILL  HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE TRYING TO  GET IN. JUST LET THEM IN. 18 YEARS AGO, PEOPLE WERE MAKING MORE MONEY IN REAL WAGES THAN  THEY MAKE TODAY. SOME PEOPLE ARE WORKING THREE JOBS. THEY ARE OLDER AND THEIR WORKING HARDER -- THEY ARE WORKING HARDER AND THEIR MAKING LESS  MONEY. A FRIEND OF MINE THAT I'VE BEEN  TELLING THIS STORY OVER THE LAST MONTH -- IS BETTER THAN GOING TO  HARVARD AND ASKING THEM TO DO A  STUDY.  YOU LEARNED IN THREE MINUTES. RIGHT NOW, MEXICO AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE BUILDING FACILITIES, PLANTS, THE LIKES OF WHICH YOU'VE NEVER SEEN. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD THE WALL. DON'T WORRY, WE'RE GOING TO  BUILD THE WALL.   A FRIEND OF MINE  AND A SUPPORTER COMMAND A BIG  SUPPORTER, GREAT GUY, HE BUILDS LAPLANTS. HE DOESN'T WANT TO BUILD  APARTMENTS OR OFFICE BUILDINGS,  HE WANTS TO BUILD PLANTS. I SAID, HOW ARE THINGS GOING? HE SAID VERY WELL. HOW ARE YOU DOING IN THE U.S.?  NOT GOOD. HOW ARE YOU DOING IN MEXICO? IT IS THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD -- THEY ARE BUILDING PLANS  THE LIKES OF WHICH I'VE NEVER  SEEN. HE'S BUILDING SOME OF THE GREATEST PLANTS -- YOU LOOK AT  FOR MOVING VAST OPERATIONS IN MEXICO -- FORD MOVING VAST  OPERATIONS TO MEXICO. MILLIONS OF JOBS, THOUSANDS OF  COMPANIES OVER THE YEARS HAVE LEFT US AND WE HAVE A FEW  THINGS. WE HAVE UNEMPLOYMENT FROM EMPTY PLANTS -- I SAW IT IN NEW YORK STATE, I SAW IT IN PENNSYLVANIA  THAT YOU WERE GREAT TO ME, YOU  VOTED A BIG VICTORY FOR DONALD  TRUMP. THANK YOU.   THAT WAS A BIG  VICTORY. IF I DON'T WIN PENNSYLVANIA --  AND BY THE WAY MY WAS TALKING TO  OUR GREAT CONGRESSMAN -- WHERE IS HE? HE IS HERE SOMEPLACE. HE LOVES THE PEOPLE AND I HAVE TO SAY, OF ALL OF PENNSYLVANIA, HE WANTS TO SEE THIS STATE DO  WELL.  THANK YOU.   BUT JUST TALKING,  BACK TO A FEW OF MY FRIENDS THAT  LIVE HERE, WE HAVE A FEW OF THE  FRIENDS AND WE SEE WHAT HAPPENED  WITH GENERAL ELECTRIC WHERE THEY  ARE CUTTING WAY BACK. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU KNOW WHY THEY ARE CUTTING BACK.  WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF OUR MINERS  AND WE ARE NOT PRODUCING COAL  AND THEY DON'T NEED TO MAKE  THOSE BIG, BIG, BEAUTIFUL -- YOU COULD CALL THE LOCOMOTIVES, I GUESS. WHATEVER THE HELL THEY ARE  COMMITTEE ARE BIG AND POWERFUL  AND THEY DON'T NEED THEM LIKE  THEY USED TO BECAUSE WE DON'T MAKE OUR GOVERNMENT WORK FOR US. THEY ARE NOT WORKING FOR US. THEY ARE WORKING FOR OTHERS. WHEN GENERAL ELECTRIC GOES OUT -- YOU SEE THE NUMBERS COME I  SEE THE NUMBERS. I JUST LEFT PARTS OF VIRGINIA  AND WEST VIRGINIA AND THE COAL  INDUSTRY IS DECIMATED. THE MINERS ARE TOTALLY OUT OF  WORK. THERE WILL BE NO SUCH THING AS  COAL IN THIS COUNTRY PRETTY SOON.  WE ARE TALKING CLEAN COAL. I WAS WITH THE MINERS, WE HAVE  SUCH TREMENDOUS SUPPORT IN WEST VIRGINIA, THE MINING PARTS OF  VIRGINIA, ALL OVER OHIO. HILLARY CLINTON THE STATEMENT NOT SO LONG AGO, SHE SAID WE ARE  GOING TO PUT THE MINES AND MINERS OUT OF BUSINESS. SO, WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THAT  HAPPEN. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THAT  HAPPEN. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT  HAPPEN IN PENNSYLVANIA. A LOT OF YOUR MINERS HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR JOBS, BUT YOU  HAVE A LOT OF OTHER JOBS THAT  ARE RELIANT ON THE MINES. LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, GENERAL ELECTRIC. WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS GOING  TO BE SO SPECIAL, WE ARE GOING  TO BRING IT BACK, WE ARE GOING TO BRING BACK OUR JOBS, WE ARE GOING TO BRING BACK OUR  COMPANIES. WHEN A COMPANY WANTS TO LEAVE OUR COUNTRY TO GO TO ANOTHER COUNTRY AND THINK THEY ARE GOING  TO MAKE THEIR PRODUCT AND BECAUSE OUR POLITICIANS ARE WEAK, STUPID, TAKEN CARE OF BY  LOBBYISTS, SPECIAL INTERESTS, THEY ARE TAKEN CARE OF BY LOBBYISTS, THEY ARE TAKEN CARE  OF BY DONORS AND SPECIAL  INTERESTS -- A FRIEND OF MINE SAID I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE  TALKING ABOUT A DEAL THAT TOOK  PLACE A MONTH AGO. WHY CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? IT IS GOOD FOR THE POLITICIANS. THEY ARE TAKING CARE OF BY THEIR  LOBBYISTS AND THEIR DONORS AND  THE SPECIAL INTERESTS. EVEN THOUGH YOU SAY WE WANT  GENERAL ELECTRIC TO PRODUCE MORE  COMMITTED THEY DON'T WANT TO --  IF THEY DON'T WANT TO WOR ONE OF THE DONORS FOR HILLARY  CLINTON SAYS THEY DON'T WANT TO COME EVEN KNOW IT'S GREAT FOR  YOU AND THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, IT'S NOT GOING TO  HAPPEN, BOOKS. -- IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, BOOKS. THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, BOOKS -- IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN,, FLOLKS. YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE YOUR JOB,  SO YOU WILL NOW GET TWO  PART-TIME JOBS THAT DON'T ADD UP  TO HALF OF WHAT USED TO MAKE,  THAT STUFF IS NOT HAPPENING ANYMORE. THEY'RE GOING TO BUILD THAT PLANT -- IF I WERE HEREBY YEARS  AGO AND IT PRESIDENT OBAMA PUT ME AND MAYBE SECRETARY OF  KEEPING BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES -- THAT'S MY TITLE,  SECRETARY OF KEEPING BUSINESS IN  THE UNITED STATES.   I LIKE THE SOUND OF SECRETARY OF DEFENSE BETTER -- OH, BY THE WAY, WE ARE GOING  TO BUILD OUR MILITARY. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS, BELIEVE ME.   BUT I LIKE THE SOUND OF SECRETARY OF DEFENSE. I LIKE THE SOUND OF SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY I LIKE THE SOUND OF  SECRETARY OF STATE, BUT I WOULD  BE GOOD AT KEEPING JOBS OVER HERE. WOULD I BE -- WAIT A MINUTE.   I WILL TELL YOU THIS -- THE BERNIE SANDERS  PROTESTERS WERE MUCH, MUCH STRONGER. THEY HAD MUCH MORE PASSION, I  HAVE TO SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING -- IF I COULD SPEAK TO THEM FOR  FIVE MINUTES, WE WANT A STRONG MILITARY, WE WANT TO TAKE CARE  ABOUT PEOPLE, WE WANT GOOD  EDUCATION AND GOOD HOUSING AND  GOOD HEALTH CARE -- WE ARE ALL  IN IT FOR THE SAME THING.   REALLY AMAZING,  REALLY AMAZING. I WILL BE YOUR SECRETARY OF KEEPING COMPANIES IN THE  UNITED STATES. I WOULD GO TO A COMPANY LIKE  CARRIER AIR-CONDITIONING WHICH  DECIDED TO LEAVE INDIANAPOLIS AND I WOULD SAY, HERE'S THE  STORY COMING YOU THINK IT'S  WONDERFUL THAT YOU ARE NEGOTIATING WITH MEXICO COME I'M  SURE YOU WILL HAVE A WONDERFUL PLANT -- IF YOU BILL THAT PLANT  AND YOU FIRE ALL THESE PEOPLE  WHO WERE SO GREAT TO ME -- INDIANA COME I WON THAT IN A LANDSLIDE -- THE TIMING WAS  GOOD. I KNOW WHAT TO DO, HILLARY  DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  DID YOU SEE HER YESTERDAY? SHE HAS NO CLUE WHAT WE'RE  TALKING ABOUT. FOLKS, SHE HAS NO CLUE. CROOKED HILLARY, SHE DOESN'T  KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. BY THE WAY, AND SHE DID, SHE  COULDN'T DO IT ANYWAY BECAUSE  THE DONORS DON'T WANT HER TO DO  IT. I WOULD GO TO THEM AND SAY THIS  IS TO KEEP THEM -- HERE'S THE STORY, IF YOU LEAVE, IN THIS CASE FROM INDIANAPOLIS, YOU ARE  GOING TO GO TO MEXICO AND MAKE  YOUR AIR-CONDITIONING UNIT --  EVERY SINGLE UNIT YOU MAKE THAT CROSSES OUR NOW VERY STRONG  BORDER, WE ARE GOING TO CHARGE  YOU 35% OF THE COST OF THAT  UNIT.   SO SIMPLE. 35% THE COST OF THAT UNIT, WE HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR NEW PLANT. VERY HOT WEATHER OUT THERE, VERY HOT. 35% IS COMING TO US. HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN --  WE'VE LOST THOUSANDS AND  THOUSANDS OF COMPANIES. WE'VE LOST MILLIONS OF JOBS -- TOO LATE. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE 10  YEARS AGO.  NOBODY WOULD HAVE LEFT. YOU NEED THE RIGHT MESSENGER -- ON YOUR MESSENGER IN TERMS OF  THIS MOVEMENT. YOU NEED THE RIGHT MESSENGER SAYING IT. NORMALLY, THEY WOULD CALL UP WHOEVER IS PUTTING THE ORDER  DOWN LIKE THE NEW PRESIDENT AND  IT WOULD HAVE   LOBBYISTS CALL UP AND THEY WOULD  SAY, HILLARY, I'M SORRY, YOU CANNOT DO THAT, THEY GIVE YOU $2 MILLION. SHE WILL SAY, OK, I WILL NOT DO  THAT. WITH ME, I'M PUTTING MY MONEY UP , FOLKS. WE ARE RAISING MONEY FOR RIGHTS  AND FOR THE RNC. I FINANCED -- I FUNDED MY PRIMARIES AND I SPENT LESS THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN TERMS OF THE PRIMARIES AND I WON IN A LANDSLIDE. OTHERS PAID 3, 5 TIMES MORE AND THEY LOST. WHO DO YOU WANT IN CHARGE OF YOUR FINANCES? AND THEN THEY DON'T LIKE ME. SOME OF THEM JUST CANNOT GET  OVER IT. GET OVER IT. WERE JUST HAVING FUN. GET OVER IT. YOU SIGNED A PLEDGE, I HEREBY  GUARANTEE THAT I WILL ENDORSE  WHOEVER WINS -- ALL THOSE  PLEDGES, THEY WERE SIGNED SO  THAT I WOULD SIGN IT. AND I WOULD HAVE HONORED IT. EVEN IF I WASN'T FOND OR DIDN'T LIKE, I WOULD HAVE HONORED IT. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THESE  COMPANIES THAT HAVEN'T LEFT -- I'M LOOKING AT YOUR NUMBERS, FOLKS.  YOU ARE NOT DOING TOO WELL HERE. PENNSYLVANIA HAS LOST ONE IN THREE MANUFACTURING JOBS AND SNAPPED THE. -- SINCE NAFTA. NAFTA WAS SIGNED BY BILL  CLINTON. AND I BELIEVE IT IS THE SINGLE WORST TRADE DOCUMENT EVER SIGNED  IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY  AND PROBABLY IN THE HISTORY OF  OUR WORLD. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST ONE-SIDED DOCUMENTS I'VE EVER SEEN. IT ALLOWED MEXICO AND PLACES TO  DO UNBELIEVABLY WELL AT OUR EXPENSE. I WILL RENEGOTIATE NAFTA THAT IS  A DISASTER. -- TPP WAS A DISASTER. HILLARY WAS IN FAVOR OF TPP.  SHE SAID IT WAS THE GOLD  STANDARD. TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. I DON'T THINK IT CAN BE WORSE THAN NOT THAT, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE AS BAD AS NAFTA. -- WORSE THAN NAFTA, BUT IT'S  GOING TO BE AS BAD AS NAFTA. SHE SAID IT IS THE GOLD  STANDARD.  SHE IS READING FROM A  TELEPROMPTER. IT IS THE GOLD STANDARD -- OH, BOY.  OUR COUNTRY IS IN TROUBLE. SHE SAID IT IS THE GOLD STANDARD. WHEN SHE HEARD ME MAKE A SPEECH AND HEARD ME TALKING NEGATIVELY ABOUT IT -- THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT DEVALUATION, THE SINGLE  GREATEST TOOL IS COUNTRIES ARE  THAT THESE COUNTRIES ARE USING -- SO COMPLICATED, THIS  AGREEMENT. I BELIEVE IN TRADE DEALS. ONE COUNTRY AT A TIME. WE WILL HAVE ONE LINE.  IF THEY DON'T DO WELL AND THEY  DON'T BEHAVE THEMSELVES AND THEY  WANT TO START DEVALUING THEIR CURRENCIES, WE WRITE THEM AND  SERVE THEM A 30 DAY NOTICE. HOW GREAT ARE OUR POLICE,  RIGHT?   WE NEED LAW AND  ORDER. WE NEED LAW AND ORDER AND WE WILL HAVE LAW AND ORDER. OUR POLICE, FIREMEN -- OUR  POLICE DO A FANTASTIC JOB. THEY ARE NOT RECOGNIZED FOR THE  JOB THEY DO. IF THEY HAVE 500,000 INCIDENTS COME ON POSITIVE, BEAUTIFULLY HANDLED, ONE BAD THING HAPPENS,  THAT ONE BAD THING IS ON THE  NEWS FOR TWO WEEKS AND IT'S A DISGRACE. WE SHOULD BE VERY THANKFUL FOR  THE JOB THEY DO. SO, PENNSYLVANIA IS LOSING A LOT  OF ITS BUSINESS. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE SITTING HERE,  WERE TALKING -- HERE'S ANOTHER  ONE. GO HOME. GO HOME TO MOMMY.   AND YOUR MOTHER IS  VOTING FOR TRUMP! IT'S TRUE.   IT'S TRUE. BY THE WAY, JUST TO INTERJECT -- I WAS TOLD THIS WHOLE AREA IS DEMOCRATIC. MANY DEMOCRAT. -- MEANING DEMOCRAT. I WAS TOLD THAT BY A LOT OF  DIFFERENT PEOPLE OUTSIDE AND THEY SAID I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE 10,000 PEOPLE, YOU  PEOPLE OUTSIDE TRYING TO GET IN -- THIS GUY CAME UP TO ME AND  SAID I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING  LIKE IT. HE SAID, YOU ARE GOING TO WIN IN  A LANDSLIDE.   BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE  TIRED OF LIES, TIRED OF LOSING THEIR JOBS, TIRED OF SEEING THEIR COMPANIES AND RIPPED OUT  AND GOING TO OTHER PLACES. THEY ARE TIRED OF CHINA COMING  IN AND DROPPING STEEL ALL OVER  THE PLACE TO PUT YOUR COMPANIES  OUT OF BUSINESS, SO WE HAVE TO  GO TO CHINA TO GET OUR STEEL,  WHICH IS HAPPENING VERY QUICKLY. THAT IS WHY THE STEEL WORKERS ARE WITH ME, THAT IS WHY THE  MINERS ARE WITH ME, THAT IS WHY  THE WORKING PEOPLE,  ELECTRICIANS, THE PLUMBERS, THE SHEET ROCKERS, THE CONCRETE GUYS AND GALS, THEY ARE WITH US. HOW COME YOU RELATE TO THESE PEOPLE? MY FATHER BUILT HOUSES AND I USED TO WORK IN THESE HOUSES AND I GOT TO KNOW THE ELECTRICIANS,  I GOT TO KNOW THE PLUMBERS, THE STEAMFITTERS, I GOT TO KNOW THEM ALL. I LIKED THEM BETTER THAN THE RICH PEOPLE I KNOW. THEY ARE BETTER. I LIKE THEM BETTER. SO, ANYWAY -- AND, WE ARE GOING  TO PUT PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. IT'S GOING TO GO QUICKLY. SO, EERIE HAS LOST ONE IN  THREE MANUFACTURING JOBS. I FLEW OVER, YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PLANTS, PLANS THAT 25 YEARS AGO, 20 YEARS AGO, 15 YEARS AGO,  SOME TWO YEARS AGO WERE VIBRANT,  BUT NO PLANT TWO YEARS AGO WAS TO VIBRANT, BUT YOU SEE THEM. THEY ARE FALLING OVER. THE RAIN, THE SLEEK, THE SNOW, THE WIND, GREAT BUILDINGS FALLING APART DON'T FEEL BAD ALL  OVER THE COUNTRY. UPSTATE NEW YORK AS A DISASTER. WHICH HILLARY CLINTON SAID SHE  WAS GOING TO FIX. THE WASHINGTON POST IS EXTRAORDINARY DISHONEST, AND THAT'S FINE, BUT THEY WROTE A STORY -- HILLARY CLINTON, WHEN SHE RAN FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE, SHE SAID TO THE PEOPLE  OF UPSTATE NEW YORK, WHO WERE  BEGINNING TO HAVE PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF HER HUSBAND'S NAFTA, SHE SAID I WILL TURN IT AROUND  AND CREATE YOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS. -- 200,000 JOBS. GUESS WHAT. SHE GOT ELECTED AND DID NOTHING. THE ONLY ONES THAT BENEFITED  WITH THE CONSULTANTS AND THEIR PEOPLE THAT HELPED HER OUT. IT IS A DISASTER. UPSTATE NEW YORK IS RIGHT NOW  WORSE THAN ANYTHING YOU HAVE IN  THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. SHE DID NOTHING.  I WATCHED HER YESTERDAY, WHICH  IS HARD TO DO, BECAUSE SHE IS BORING, OK?    I WATCHED HER  YESTERDAY, TALKING ABOUT -- YOU  KNOW, IT'S PUTTING, I SAID I  WILL RENEGOTIATE NAFTA. WHAT IF YOU CAN'T MAKE A DEAL? WE ARE TO TERMINATE AND GET OUT. VERY SIMPLE. I SAID WE ARE GOING TO  RENEGOTIATE DIFFERENT TRADE  DEALS. ALL OF A SUDDEN, TWO DAYS AGO, I  WILL RENEGOTIATE TRADE GUILDS. THAT'S TRADE DEALS. SHE'S GOING TO RENEGOTIATE TRADE DEALS THE SAME WAY SHE WAS GOING  TO PUT 200,000 JOBS IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. A TOTAL FANTASY.  I RESPECT ""THE WASHINGTON POST."" YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING --  THE ONLY WAY SHE GETS ELECTED IS  THAT THEY DON'T REPORT ON HER. THEY HAVE ME ON SO MUCH  TELEVISION. ON CNN, THE CLINTON NEWS NETWORK --   THINK OF IT. YESTERDAY, THEY HAD YESTERDAY A  SCANDAL WITH E-MAILS. ANOTHER ONE. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT  33,000 E-MAILS SHE DELETED THAT CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WAS ON  THOSE E-MAILS? 33,000 E-MAILS WERE DELETED. AND SHE SAID, WELL, IT HAD TO DO  WITH THE WEDDING AND YOGA. I GIVE TWO TO YOGA AND FIVE TO  THE WEDDING. THE LIES AND DECEPTION -- WE ARE RUNNING LIKE THEY RUN RIGHT NOW  IN A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY, FOLKS. YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED. WE ARE BEING TALKED ABOUT ALL  OVER THE WORLD -- WHEN THEY WERE  GOING OVER THE CHARGES AGAINST  HILLARY CLINTON, ONE AFTER  ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER -- AND YET, THE PEOPLE, THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED FOR DOING MUCH LESS. SO NOW THEY HAVE A BIG SCANDAL  IN NEW YORK AREA AIDS IN THE NEW  YORK PAPERS, BUT VERY LITTLE. -- IN NEW YORK. THEY HAVE IT IN THE NEW YORK  PAPERS, BUT VERY LITTLE. OUR GOVERNMENT IS FOR SALE. OUR GOVERNMENT IS FOR SALE BY A CROOKED PERSON. AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS THEY  ARE TRYING TO NOT TALK ABOUT  HER. TAKE A LOOK. YOU GO TO CNN AS AN EXAMPLE. STORY AFTER STORY ABOUT TRUMP.  TRUMP. TRUMP. TRUMP. TRUMP. AND YESTERDAY, IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF THE  NEGATIVE HIT JOBS AND CNN IS STARTING TO DO VERY POORLY.  THAT'S GOOD.  I LIKE THAT. I HAVE TO SAY THAT FOX HAS BEEN TREATING US FAIRLY. FOX HAS BEEN FAIR. BUT CNN HAS BEEN CATASTROPHIC.  IT'S SO DISHONEST. BUT SOMEONE WAS EXPLAINING TO ME  THEIR THEORY.  IF THEY DON'T REPORT ON HER, PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO KNOW HOW BAD SHE IS.  LOOK AT HER NEWS CONFERENCE. SHE HASN'T HAD A NEWS CONFERENCE  IN 260 DAYS. THAT LAST ONE WASN'T A NEWS  CONFERENCE. THAT WAS A FEW OF HER FRIENDS. THEY ASKED HER A QUESTION. WHAT DID SHE SAY ABOUT THE  CIRCUIT, RIGHT? IF I EVER SAID THAT, SHORT-CIRCUITED, IF I EVER SAID I SHORT-CIRCUITED, IT WOULD BE  HEADLINES ALL OVER THE WORLD. THEY WOULD CALL FOR THE DEATH PENALTY.  CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I SAID THAT I  SURE CONSECUTIVE FASHION THAT I SHORT-CIRCUITED? I MEAN, I STAND APPEAR FOR  MONTHS IN FRONT OF MASSIVE CROWDS AND SHE GETS 300 PEOPLE  GOING TO HER EVENTS. SHE GETS 300 PEOPLE AND THEN SHE  READS SOMETHING FROM A  TELEPROMPTER AND SHE GOES HOME  AND GOES TO SLEEP. AND THEN SHE WAKES AT THEN SHE  GOES AGAIN.  AND I'M TELLING YOU -- AND  NOBODY DOES ANYTHING ABOUT IT. NOW ME, I STAND UP HERE -- I'M  NOT LOOKING AT NOTES.  I'M NOT READING TELEPROMPTERS. NOT EASY. NOT EASY. NOT EASY.  BUT -- BUT -- REMEMBER -- AND IF  I MAKE ONE MISTAKE AND YOU MENTION SOMETHING WRONG LIKE  HARAMBE, THE HEADLINES ARE ALL  OVER. SHE CAN SAY SHE SHORT-CIRCUITED UP HERE. I DON'T WANT A PRESIDENT WHO SHORT-CIRCUITS. IS THAT OK? I DON'T WANT IT. I DON'T WANT A PRESIDENT WHO  SHORT-CIRCUITS. WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH ISIS. WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH CHINA. WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE. THEY ARE NOT SURE CAN CIRCUITING -- THEY ARE NOT  SHORT-CIRCUITING. LET ME JUST TELL YOU. OVER THE LAST A WHILE -- I TOLD  YOU BIG DEAL. WHEN I SAID OBAMA -- AND OF COURSE, I'M BEING SARCASTIC.  AND THEY KNOW THAT.  I SAID HE'S GOING TO COLLECT HIS M.V.P. AWARD.  SO I SAID OBAMA IS THE FOUNDER  OF ISIS.  THE FOUNDER.  AND THESE DISHONEST MEDIA PEOPLE -- THEY ARE MOST DISHONEST PEOPLE -- THEY SAY, OH, DID HE  MEAN THAT? DIDN'T HE MEAN THAT? IN FACT, THEY LIKE HIM SO MUCH  BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN SO WEAK AND  SO BAD. I MEAN, HE LET THIS HAPPEN. THEY HAD AID STATES. THEY HAD EIGHT COUNTRIES. THEY NOW HAVE 28 COUNTRIES. THEY ARE EXPANDING. SO I SAID THE FOUNDER --  OBVIOUSLY, I'M BEING SARCASTIC -- BUT NOT THAT SARCASTIC, TO BE  HONEST WITH YOU.  AND THEY ALL SAID HE SHOULD NOT  SAY THAT. THEY SHOULD CALL HIM AN ENABLER. CALL HIM AN ENABLER. PLEASE AN ENABLER. I SAID, THAT DOESN'T SOUND THE SAME.  THESE PEOPLE ARE THE WORST. SO LISTEN, I SAID THE FOUNDER OF  ISIS. AND IN FACT, VERY SOON HE IS  GOING OVER TO PICK UP HIS MOST  VALUABLE PLAYER AWARD. DID I SAY THAT?  I SAY THAT ALL THE TIME.  SO THEY KNEW I WAS BEING SARCASTIC.  BY NOW THEY ARE ANALYZING. DID I REALLY MEAN THAT? HOW COULD I SAY THAT? THESE PEOPLE ARE THE LOWEST FORM OF LIFE. I'M TELLING YOU.  THE LOWEST. THEY ARE THE LOWEST FORM OF HUMANITY. NOT ALL OF THEM. THEY HAVE ABOUT 25% THAT ARE  PRETTY GOOD, ACTUALLY.  BUT MOST OF THEM. OK, SO HERE IS THE STORY. SO EERIE HAS LOST A LOT. DON'T LEAVE.  I PROMISE. WE CAN FIX IT SO FAST. WE WILL STOP THESE COUNTRIES FROM TAKING OUR JOBS. WE WILL STOP THESE COUNTRIES  FROM TAKING HARD COMPANIES. HOLD ON. OUR JOB WILL COME BACK. NOW I CAME UP WITH A GREAT PLAN. I'M LOWERING CORPORATE TAXES SO  OUR COMPANIES STAY. SO I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO MAKE THE CALL. THE CORPORATE INVERSIONS. WE HAVE COMPANIES WHO SAVE $2.5  TRILLION OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY. THEY CAN'T.  GET THEIR MONEY BACK. WE DON'T LET THEM. REPUBLICANS, EVERYBODY AGREES. WHY DO WE NOT WANT THEM TO BRING  MONEY BACK? BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A  PRESIDENT THAT CAN SIT THE LEADERS OF BOTH PARTIES AROUND  THE TABLE AND COME IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, LET THEM SAY LET'S BRING THIS MONEY BACK SO WE CAN  WORK IT IN THIS COUNTRY, RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT IT IS. SO WE ARE GOING TO BRING THAT  MONEY BACK IN. WE ARE GOING TO LOWER TAXES. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP OUR  COMPANIES. AND IF OUR COMPANIES WANT TO  LEAVE, THEY WILL PAY A NICE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL TAX TO GET THEIR  PRODUCT BACK IN.  AS WITH GOING TO HAPPEN.  SO THE EXISTING U.S. TRADE DEFICIT, WITH TPP PARTICIPATING NATIONS, HAS ALREADY COST PENNSYLVANIA 68,000 JOBS, FOLKS. NO MORE, FOLKS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE THE  STUPID PEOPLE ANYMORE. WE ARE GOING TO BE THE REALLY, REALLY SMART PEOPLE. IT IS GOING TO BE AMERICA FIRST. AMERICA FIRST.  AMERICA FIRST.  >>  SO THE MANUFACTURING IN PENNSYLVANIA WAS CAUSED BY  HILLARY CLINTON AND HER DISASTROUS HUSBAND'S POLICYMAKING. EVERY JOB KILLING TRADE DEAL FOR DECADES SHE HAS RECEIVED SO MUCH, MONEY. SHE HAS APPROVED VIRTUALLY EVERY  TAX INCREASE PUT BEFORE HER. YESTERDAY, YOU SEE, $1.3  TRILLION IN TAX INCREASES.  WITH THE HIGHEST TAX NATION IN  THE LAND, ESSENTIALLY, THE HIGHEST TAXED NATION IN THE WORLD. AND OF THE INDUSTRIALIZED  NATIONS, WE ARE FAR AND AWAY THE HIGHEST TEXT NATION.  AND SHE IS PROPOSING A MASSIVE  TAX INCREASE. FOLKS, WE CAN'T DO IT. IT'S GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY NONCOMPETITIVE.  IT'S ALREADY NONCOMPETITIVE. . IT'S GOING TO MAKE OUR. COUNTRY NONCOMPETITIVE AND WE  ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT. I'M PROPOSING A MASSIVE TAX  DECREASE.  FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. FOR BUSINESS. AND BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO POUR  IN. AND NOT SINCE RONALD REAGAN AS  ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEEN  PROPOSED. BUSINESSES, INSTEAD OF LEAVING  BECAUSE THEIR TAXES ARE SO HIGH,  THEY ARE GOING TO STAY.  I WILL HAVE TO MAKE THOSE CALLS. I WILL IF I HAVE TO. I MEAN MY PEOPLE WILL. I LOVE IT. I WILL TELL THEM YOU'RE NOT  MOVING. MR. PRESIDENT, I WOULD LIKE TO  MOVE TO MEXICO.  YOU'RE NOT MOVING. OR YOU WILL PAY 35% TAX. IN THAT CASE, I'M NOT MOVING. SO EASY.  YOUR CALL INDUSTRY, YOUR STEEL INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN RAVAGED. GENERAL ELECTRICS OF THE WORLD HAVE BEEN RAVAGED. OVER THE YEARS, I'VE WATCHED, FOR YEARS, FOR 10 YEARS, FOR 12 YEARS, FOR 15 YEARS, BEYOND  OBAMA. AND I HAVE WATCHED HOW POLITICIANS HAVE TALKED ABOUT STOPPING COUNTRIES FROM LEAVING -- STOPPING COMPANIES FROM  LEAVING.  OUR STATES. AND YOU WATCH. YOU KNOW THEY GIVE THE  LOW-INTEREST LOANS.  HERE IS A LOW-INTEREST LOAN IF  YOU STAY IN PENNSYLVANIA.  HERE IS A ZERO INTEREST LOAN IF  YOU STAY. WE WILL HELP YOUR -- IT DOESN'T  WORK, FOLKS.  THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY NEED.  THEY HAVE MONEY.  THEY WANT TO GO OUT.  YOU WANT TO MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY. AND BECAUSE THEIR POLITICIANS  ARE SO DUMB, THEY WANT TO SELL  THEIR PRODUCT TO US AND NOT HAVE  ANY RETRIBUTION, NOT ANY  CONSEQUENCE. SO ALL OF THAT IS OVER.  AND I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND IT.  AND HILLARY CAN'T DO IT. NUMBER ONE, SHE CAN DO IT  BECAUSE THE MENTALITY ISN'T  THERE. SHE CAN'T DO IT.  NO.  THE MENTALITY. SHE SAID FAIRLY RECENTLY, I DON'T LIKE DONALD TRUMP'S TONE.  HIS TONE ISN'T NICE. AND I SAID, HERE WE HAVE A  COUNTRY THAT'S BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. OUR BUSINESSES ARE BEING TAKEN.  OUR JOBS BEING TAKEN.  EVERYTHING IS BEING TAKEN. HERE WE HAVE A WORLD WHERE ISIS  IS CHOPPING OFF THE HEADS OF CHRISTIANS AND MANY OTHERS, DROWNING PEOPLE IN STEEL CAGES,  BURYING PEOPLE IN THE SAND, AND  WE HAVE SOMEBODY UP THERE WHO  WANTS TO BE OUR PRESIDENT THAT  SAYS I DON'T LIKE DONALD TRUMP'S TONE.  FOLKS, WE BETTER GET SMART,  FOLKS. HEY, LOOK, LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.  WE BETTER GET SMART.  WE BETTER GET SMART. WE BETTER GET SMART. WE BETTER GET TOUGH.  AND IF WE ARE NOT SMART AND WE ARE NOT TOUGH, WE WON'T HAVE A  COUNTRY LEFT. IN ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO  TALK TO YOU ALL ABOUT BEFORE I  LEAVE IS OUR BORDERS. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE POURING  INTO OUR COUNTRY. IN FACT, --   I BROUGHT SOMETHING FOR YOU  PEOPLE. I BROUGHT -- I BROUGHT -- I DIDN'T WANT TO DEPRESS YOU. OK, LOOK. THE CLINTON LEGACY. NEARLY ONE IN THREE  MANUFACTURING JOBS IN EERIE, PA -- SOUND FAMILIAR -- HAVE BEEN LOST SINCE CLINTON HAS ALLOWED A  CERTAIN DEAL WITH CHINA TO  HAPPEN.  LOOK AT THIS CHART. THIS IS 2001, NOT LONG AGO.  THIS IS NOW. CONGRATULATIONS, FOLKS.  I HOPE YOU'RE DOING WELL. I HOPE YOU ARE DOING WELL. I DON'T WANT TO HURT THEM. I HOPE YOU'RE DOING WELL.  BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?  YOU CAN'T DO WELL. WHEN YOU HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT  IS SO STUPID, THAT IS SO INCOMPETENT, YOU CAN'T DO IT. HERE'S ANOTHER ONE, FOLKS.  THIS IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING  ABOUT. SYRIAN REFUGEES -- WE HAVE NO  IDEA WHO THEY ARE, WHERE THEY  ARE COMING FROM, NO PAPERWORK. YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN BERNARDINO.  Q SO WHAT HAPPENED -- FRANKLY,  TAKE A LOOK AT ALL OVER THE  WORLD.  TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS  HAPPENING. IF WE DON'T GET SMART AND WE  DON'T GET SMART FAST, BARACK  OBAMA IS ALLOWING SYRIAN TO COME  INTO OUR COUNTRY BY THE  THOUSANDS. I HAVE AS BIG A HARD AS ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM AND I WANT TO BUILD SAFE ZONES AND I WANT, BY THE WAY, THE GULF STATES TO PAY FOR IT BECAUSE IT HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY AND THEY ARE NOT DOING  MUCH. WE WILL SUPERVISE THEM. OPM, OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY. WE WILL SUPERVISE THEM, RIGHT? BUT THEY ARE GOING TO PAY FOR  IT. BECAUSE WE ARE PROTECTING THESE  PEOPLE. IF IT WERE FOR THE UNITED STATES, THOSE COUNTRIES WOULDN'T EVEN EXIST.  IT WOULD BE GONE. THE POWER WE HAVE IS SO A NORM  BUT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO DON'T  KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. WE HAVE AN INCOMPETENT PRESIDENT.  WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW  WHAT THEY'RE DOING.  SO LOOK AT THIS.  LOOK AT THIS. SYRIAN REFUGEES ADMITTED TO THE UNITED STATES ON A MONTHLY  BASIS. LOOK WHAT IS HAPPENING.  LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING.  NOW, IN ALL FAIRNESS, WE WANT TO  HELP PEOPLE. CAN'T TAKE A CHANCE. SAN BERNARDINO, THEY WALK IN.  A START SHOOTING. PARIS, THE BEST, THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE WORLD, PARIS, FRANCE.  THEY WALK IN. THEY KILL. 130 PEOPLE. THEY WOUND SO GRAVELY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. LET ME TELL YOU BECAUSE WE ARE  IN SECOND AMENDMENT, RIGHT,  SECOND AMENDMENT. IF WE HAD IN SAN BERNARDINO OR  IN ORLANDO OR SOMEPLACE, SOMEBODY IN THAT ROOM LIKE THIS GUY RIGHT HERE, RIGHT? OR THAT GUY WITH THE BLUE MAKE  AMERICA GREAT HAD ON?  OR THE GUY WITH THE RED MAKE AMERICA -- OR THAT WOMAN WITH THE BEAUTIFUL BLONDE HAIR -- I WISH I HAD HAIR THAT LOOKED LIKE THAT. BUT IF WE HAD SOMEBODY AND THEY  HAPPENED TO HAVE A GUN, SAN  BERNARDINO, THEY SEE HIM COME IN -- FIRST OF ALL, IF THEY KNEW  THERE WAS A GUN WHERE THE  BULLETS BE FLYING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION, THEY PROBABLY WOULD  NOT COME IN, OK?  BUT LET'S ASSUME THEY DID. THE CARNAGE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WITH THE CARNAGE WAS.  WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE SECOND  AMENDMENT. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO KILL  THE SECOND AMENDMENT .  WANTS TO KILL. SO HERE'S OUR CHARGE. I DO A LOT OF THESE.  I LOVE THE PEOPLE. WE HAVE SUCH A MOVEMENT GOING  ON. WHO LIKES THE SNAKE? WHO LIKES THE SNAKE?  DO YOU LIKE HIM? HERE WE ARE WITH THIS. WE KNOW BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. WE KNOW AS WE ALLOW MORE AND  MORE PEOPLE TO COME IN FROM  THESE TERROR AREAS, BAD THINGS  ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. HAS ANYBODY HEARD THE SNAKE? NOT THAT MANY. SHOULD I DO IT AGAIN? SO THINK OF THIS, FIX -- FOLKS. TAKE OF THIS. THIS IS WHAT IS GOING ON IN OUR  COUNTRY. BY THE WAY, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE  A STRONG BORDER.  WE WILL HAVE A WALL.  IT WILL BE A STRONG WALL AND  MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR.  AND WE HAVE NO CHOICE.  AND WE HAVE NO CHOICE. BUT THINK OF THIS. THIS IS NOW A SITUATION WHERE  THIS WAS WRITTEN BY OUR WILSON  MANY YEARS AGO.  I READ AND THAT REALLY PERTAINS TO WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE UNITED STATES. AND IT HAS TO DO WITH BEING  FOOLED.  IT HAS TO DO WITH A LOT OF  DIFFERENT THINGS. BUT WHEN YOU'RE LISTENING TO  THIS, THINK OF OUR BORDER. THINK OF THE PEOPLE WE ARE  LETTING IN BY THE THOUSANDS. AND HILLARY CLINTON, YOU SAW  THOSE NUMBERS WITH THE CHARTS THROUGH THE ROOF, HILLARY  CLINTON WANTS TO ALLOW 550% MORE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY.  HOW STUPID ARE WE? SO, YOU'RE READY? YOU LIKE IT? ARE YOU SURE? ALL RIGHT. ON HER WAY TO WORK ONE MORNING, DOWN THE PATH ALONG THE LAKE, A  TENDERHEARTED WOMAN SAW A POOR  HALF FROZEN SNAKE. HIS PRETTY COLORED SKIN HAD BEEN  ALL FROSTED WITH THE DEW. OH WELL, SHE CRIED, I WILL TAKE YOU IN AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU. TAKE ME IN, O TENDER WOMAN. TAKE ME IN, FOR HEAVEN SAKE. TAKE ME IN, O TENDER WOMAN. SIGHED THE BROKEN SNAKE. SHE WRAPPED HIM UP ALL COZY IN A CURVATURE OF SILK. THEN LAID HIM BY THE FIRESIDE  WITH SOME HONEY AND SOME MILK. NOW SHE HURRIED HOME FROM WORK THAT NIGHT. AS SOON SHE ARRIVED, SHE FOUND  THAT PRETTY SNAKE SHE HAD TAKEN IN HAD BEEN REVIVED. TAKE ME IN, OH TENDER WOMAN. TAKE ME IN, FOR HEAVEN SAKE. TAKE ME IN, O TENDER WOMAN, SIDE  OF THE BROKEN SNAKE.  NOW SHE CLUTCHED HIM TO  HERBALISM. YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL -- NOW SHE  CLUTCHED INTO HER BOSOM. YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL, SHE CRIED. IF I DID NOT TAKE YOU IN, YOU  CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE DIED. NOW SHE STROKED HIS PRETTY SKIN  AND SHE KISSED AND HELD HIM  TIGHT.  BUT INSTEAD OF SAYING THANK YOU, THAT SNAKE GAVE HER A VICIOUS BITE. TAKE ME IN, OH TENDER WOMAN.  TAKE ME IN FOR HEAVEN SAKE,. TAKE ME IN, TENDER WOMAN, SIDE  THE VICIOUS SNAKE.  I SAVED DO, I SAVED YOU, I SAVED YOU, CRIED THAT WOMAN. AND YOU BID ME.  HEAVENS WHY? YOU KNOW YOUR BITE IS POISONOUS  AND NOW I'M GOING TO DIE. OH, SHUT UP, SILLY WOMAN, SAID THE REPTILE WITH A GRIN. YOU KNEW DAMN WELL I WAS A SNAKE  BEFORE YOU TOOK ME IN.  GET READY, FOLKS, GET READY. WE ARE LED BY STUPID PEOPLE. WE ARE LED BY LEADERS -- AND YOU  KNOW, I DIDN'T NEED THIS. I HAD A NICE LIFE. OK GREAT COMPANY, A GREAT  COMPANY. SOME OF THE GREAT REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF THE WORLD. I MAY NEVER SEE THEM. IF I WIN, I MAY NEVER SEE THEM  AGAIN.  AND I LOVE THEM. ALL OVER THE WORLD. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS SO  IMPORTANT. AND I WATCHED WHAT WAS HAPPENING  WITH THE IRAN DEAL AND I WATCHED  WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH JOBS.  AND I WATCHED WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH TRADE AND CHINA MAKES $500  BILLION IN TRADE DEFICITS WITH  US. I LOOKED AND I SAW. TAKE A LOOK AT MEXICO. YOU KNOW THE POLITICIANS SAY YOU  WILL NEVER, EVER BE ABLE TO GET  MEXICO TO ALLOW YOU TO BUILD A  WALL.  I SAY, TRUST ME. NOW THEY DON'T SAY THAT ANYMORE. THEY SAY THEY WON'T PUT THE  MONEY UP TO BUT THE WALL.  SO EASY. WITH MEXICO, OUR TRADE DEFICIT  IS SO MASSIVE. THEY MAKE MONEY OFF THE  STUPIDITY OF THE UNITED STATES.  MEXICO WILL 100% PAY FOR THE  WALL.  100%.  OK? 100%. BUT THE STORY OF THE SNAKE IS  WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR. WE ARE LETTING PEOPLE IN.  MANY OF THESE PEOPLE HATE US.  MANY OF THESE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE  GOOD THOUGHTS. AND YOU SEE WHAT ONE PERSON CAN DO, ONE SICK WACKO CAN DO IN  ORLANDO. AND THEN YOU SEE HIS FATHER SITTING BEHIND HILLARY CLINTON  WITH A BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE.  WITH A BIG FAT SMILE ON HIS FACE, RIGHT? AND HE WAS WEARING A RED HAT.  AND I SAID, I HOPE THAT'S NOT  ONE OF MY HATS. I WAS CONCERNED I HOPE IT DOESN'T SAY ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  OH BAD GUY. BAD GUY. HER WRISTS -- PRENTICE SO -- HORRENDOUS SON. HORRENDOUS SON. WE HAVE TO WIN, FOLKS. WE HAVE TO WIN.  HILLARY CLINTON IS RUN BY PEOPLE WHO DO THIS VERY PROFESSIONAL. THEY ARE VERY GOOD.  THEY KEEP HER OUT OF THE  SPOTLIGHT. SHE DOESN'T DO PRESS CONFERENCES.  SHE DOESN'T EXPOSE WHATEVER IS GOING ON UP HERE, WHICH ISN'T GOOD. SHE DOESN'T EXPOSE HER MIND TO QUESTIONS. AND WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS THEY  WANT TO TRY AND MAKE IT THROUGH. WE NEED STRENGTH. WE NEED TOUGHNESS. WE NEED A STRONG TEMPERAMENT. WE NEED A STRONG TONE. AT THE SAME TIME -- AT THE SAME  TIME -- LET ME TELL YOU, AT THE SAME TIME, WE NEED REAL BIG, BEAUTIFUL HARD, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO STRAIGHTEN OUT HEALTH CARE. OBAMACARE IS GOING TO BE  REPEALED AND REPLACED.  DID YOU SEE? DID YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING  WITH OBAMA? DID YOU SEE WHERE THE NUMBERS  ARE GOING? 30%, 40% AND 50%. WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS  ON NOVEMBER 1. NOVEMBER 1, THEY ARE TRY TO  DELAY IT. YOU'RE GOING TO GET INCREASES THE LIKES OF WHICH NO COUNTRY, NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN. ANYBODY IN THE HISTORY OF HEALTH  CARE -- IN TEXAS, GOING THROUGH BLUE CROSS/BLUE SHIELD, THEY  JUST HAD ALMOST A 50% INCREASE  IN THEIR PREMIUMS. THE DEDUCTIBLES ARE SO HIGH  THAT, UNLESS YOU GET HIT BY ONE  OF THOSE GENERAL ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES AND YOU LIVE FOR, LIKE, A LONGTIME PRIOR TO DEATH,  YOU'LL NEVER, EVER BE ABLE TO USE YOUR HEALTH CARE, THE HEALTH CARE, THE HEALTH CARE.  BECAUSE HERE IS WHAT IS  HAPPENED. THAT'S WHAT HAS HAPPENED.  THE DEDUCTIBLE IS SO HIGH, YOU  WILL NEVER GET TO USE IT. YOUR RAISES 18% TO 19%.  BUT NOW IS GOING TO GO REALLY  BAD. IT IS GOING TO DIE OF ITS OWN  VOLITION, BUT WE HAVE TO KILL IT  FIRST.  IT'S KILLING OUR COUNTRY. IT IS KILLING OUR JOBS. SO HERE IT IS, FOLKS.  FOLKS. WE HAVE TO WIN PENNSYLVANIA. WE HAVE TO BEAT THIS PROFESSIONAL GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE RUNNING HER FURTHER OWN  PURPOSES. WE HAVE TO WIN PENNSYLVANIA. WE WIN PENNSYLVANIA, WE ARE  GOING TO WIN IT.  WE ARE UP IN FLORIDA.  WE ARE DOING WELL IN OHIO.  AND I'M HEARING WE ARE DOING  WELL HERE.  WE'LL FIND OUT.  HERE'S THE STORY --   HERE'S THE STORY. WE HAVE TO WIN THE STATE OF  PENNSYLVANIA. I WENT TO SCHOOL HERE. MY KIDS WENT TO SCHOOL HERE. WE ARE GOING TO WIN  PENNSYLVANIA. IF WE WIN PENNSYLVANIA, I'LL  TELL YOU WHAT. WE ARE VERY MUCH ON HER WAY. THE REPUBLICANS DO HAVE A  TOUGHER PATH. NOT MY FAULT. NOT MY FAULT.  IT IS A TOUGHER PATH FOR THE  PRESIDENCY.  IT IS JUST A TOUGHER, WINDING ROAD.  THAT IF WE WIN PENNSYLVANIA, WE  WIN FLORIDA, WHERE WE ARE DOING  REALLY WELL, I THINK WE CAN WIN  OHIO. IT WILL BE OVER.  IT WILL BE OVER.  IT WILL BE OVER. SO ON NOVEMBER 8, YOU HAVE TO  GET OUT AND VOTE OR DO SOME BALLOTING AND -- I DON'T CARE,  LOOK, HERE'S THE STORY.  IF YOU'RE NOT FEELING WELL, IF  YOUR SO SICK, IF YOU GO TO TO  THE DOCTOR AND HE SAYS, I'M SORRY, SIR, BUT YOU'VE ONLY GOT  A FEW WEEKS LEFT, AND ITS NOVEMBER 1 AND HE GIVES YOU THE ULTIMATE WORD, NOT LOOKING GOOD, YOU HAVING GOT LONG LEFT, I DON'T CARE AND NOBODY ELSE IN  THIS ROOM CARES. YOU HAVE TO ON NOVEMBER 8 GET OUT OF BED AND GET OUT AND VOTE,  RIGHT? GET OUT AND VOTE.  NOW, IN A LETTER OF CASES, YOU  CAN DO YOUR EARLY BALLOTS. ALL IN TELLING YOU, NOW LOOK,  FOLKS, I'M JUST SAYING YOUR JOBS  HAVE BEEN TAKEN. YOUR MILITARY AND ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS -- WE ARE GOING TO  SAVE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT,  WHICH IS PROTECTION. WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF COMMON CORE. WERE GOING TO BRING YOUR EDUCATION LOCALLY. WE'RE GOING TO RIP LEO AND  REPLACE OBAMA -- ALL OF THESE  THINGS. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR  VETS.  YOU PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR,  BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN  DEVASTATED.  SUPREME COURT, HE SAID.  YES.  YES! THANK YOU, WHO SAID THAT? WHO SAID THAT? THANK YOU.  LOOK, SUPREME COURT, JUSTICE SCALIA, GREAT.  HE WAS SUPPOSED TO LIVE FOR A  LONG TIME. HE DIED. THIS NEXT PRESIDENT COULD HAVE THE MOST SUPREME COURT  NOMINATIONS OF ANY PRESIDENT  GOOD PICK MORE JUSTICES, -- IT COULD BE UP TO FIVE. IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE THREE, PROBABLY FOUR, COULD BE FIVE. OK?  IF HILLARY CLINTON GETS TO PUT  HARD LEANING LEFT JUDGES ON THE SUPREME COURT, NUMBER ONE, YOUR  SECOND AMENDMENT WILL BE GONE. OUR COUNTRY WILL NEVER, EVER BE  THE SAME. WE WILL HAVE PROBLEMS LIKE WE'VE  NEVER HAD BEFORE. AND YOU WILL HAVE A WHOLE  DIFFERENT DEAL GOING, WHICH WE  DON'T WANT, BELIEVE ME. SO HERE'S THE STORY. IF FOR NO OTHER REASON, I'M  GOING TO PUT -- AND YOU KNOW I HATE THROUGH -- AND I PICKED THROUGH FEDERALIST SOCIETY FIVE FEDERALIST JUDGES.  I GOT REALLY GOOD MARKS.  WE ARE GOING TO PICK THESE  PEOPLE OR PEOPLE VERY LIKE THEM.   SO HERE'S THE STORY. ARE YOU READY? WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE, YOU PEOPLE  DON'T WIN, THAT'S FOR SURE.  YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT THE  STATISTICS, THE JOBS. WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING  AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH THAT  YOU ARE GOING TO GET SICK AND  TIRED OF WINNING. YOU ARE GOING TO SAY, MR.  PRESIDENT, YOU ARE GOING TO SEND  THE CONGA'S MEN TO SEE ME IN  WASHINGTON. HE'S GOING TO SAY, MR. PRESIDENT, WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.  THE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA, AND  IN PARTICULAR OUR FRIENDS EERIE,  THEY ARE SICK AND TIRED OF  WINNING. THEY CAN'T STAND WINNING SO  MUCH. MR. PRESIDENT, WE JUST DON'T  WANT TO WIN THAT MUCH. WE REALLY WANT TO GIVE OTHER NATIONS LIKE IT USED TO BECOME AWARE IT'S GOOD FOR THEM AND  THAT FOR US, AT LEAST A LOW BIT. AND I'M GOING TO SAY -- I'M GOING TO SAY, MR. CONGRESSMAN, I  DON'T THINK YOU KNOW YOUR PEOPLE  VERY WELL. THEY WANT TO WIN. AND WE WANT TO WIN. AND YOU WANT TO WIN.  AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN.  WERE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH. WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH OUR  MILITARY. WERE GOING TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS. WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOR OUR VETS.  WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR  VETS. WE ARE TO BUILD THE WALL.  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MEXICO PAY, BELIEVE ME, 100%. WE'RE GOING TO WIN EDUCATION.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE SECOND  AMENDMENT. WE ARE TO WIN ALL THE THINGS WE  DISCUSSED. WE ARE GOING TO WIN AGAIN.  AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE PREDATOR  COUNTRY AGAIN.  WE WILL NOT BE LAUGH BY PEOPLE  ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR NOW -- OR  NOT KNOWING WHAT WE ARE DOING,  FOR A LONG OTHER PEOPLE TO COME  IN AND JUST STRIP US FOR WHAT WE  HAVE. WE ARE GOING TO WIN. WE ARE GOING TO BE AMERICA  FIRST. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AND IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN  QUICKLY.  THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.  THANK YOU. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO AMAZING. RUDY JUST LEFT. HE JUST SAID I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. NOBODY BELIEVES IT.   THE CROWDS WE'RE GETTING.  I'M THE MESSENGER BUT I'LL TELL  YOU WHAT, THE MESSAGE IS THE  RIGHT MESSAGE.  WE'RE TIRED OF INCOMPETENCE.  WE'RE TIRED OF NOT TAKING CARE  OF OUR MILITARY.  WE'RE TIRED OF NOT TAKING CARE OF OUR VETS, WHO HAVE BEEN TAKEN  CARE OF VERY POORLY.  WE'RE TIRED OF SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS, AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. SO OUR MAYOR, MY FRIEND RUDY  GIULIANI JUST WALKS OUT AND SAYS I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.  THIS IS INCREDIBLE.  WHAT HE HASN'T SEEN -- AND YOUR  GOVERNOR, BY THE WAY, WHO'S A GREAT GUY, AND HE'S NOW SEEING IT.  THEY'RE WALKING OUTSIDE BECAUSE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE  OUTSIDE THAT CANNOT GET IN. I SAID RUDY, YOU THINK THIS IS BAD, GO TAKE A LOOK OUTSIDE.  I WANT TO THANK PAT AND RUDY AND I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR  BEING HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.  WE LOVE NORTH CAROLINA.  WE LOVE NORTH CAROLINA -- WE DID  REALLY WELL IN THE PRIMARIES, IF YOU REMEMBER.  WE'RE DOING REALLY WELL NOW. WE HAVE TO WIN.  THAT NOVEMBER 8TH DATE IS SO IMPORTANT.  IT'S SO IMPORTANT.  I BRING THINGS UP LIKE THE JUDGES, THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES.  YOU COULD HAVE AS MANY AS FOUR -- I GUESS THERE'S A SCENARIO IN  WHICH THIS PRESIDENT COULD PICK  FIVE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES AND  IF YOU PICK TWO THAT ARE LEFT,  LEFT, LEFT IT'S GOING TO BE A  DISASTER FOR OUR COUNTRY.  YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT, THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION  ENDORSED ME AND THEY ENDORSED ME EARLY, A LONG TIME AGO --   AND THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE.  WAYNE, AND CHRIS, THEY'RE GREAT  PEOPLE BUT IF YOU DO SOMETHING WITH THIS, I TELL YOU WHAT, JUSTICE RIGHT NOW -- YOU LOST A GREAT ONE WITH SCALIA. WE WANT TO REPLACE WITH JUSTICES VERY MUCH LIKE JUSTICE SCALIA AND THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND SO IMPORTANT.  SO -- SO IF FOR NO OTHER REASON -- ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTIONS FOR A LOT OF REASONS, NOT JUST THAT. BUT FOR A LOT OF REASONS AND -- BUT THAT'S SO OBVIOUS BECAUSE FOR WHATEVER REASON, THEY SAY THIS COULD BE THE PRESIDENCY, THIS NEXT FOUR YEARS, WHERE YOU'LL PICK MORE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES THAN ANYBODY HAS EVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO AND BELIEVE ME, I'LL MAKE YOU VERY PROUD OF THOSE JUSTICES. THEY'LL BE GOOD. OK?   SO WE HAD AN INCIDENT  A FEW DAYS AGO WITH THE 400 MILLION CASH.  400 MILLION CASH.  ANYBODY KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE?  THAT'S A LOT OF CASH.  AND HONESTLY, IT'S SO SAD.  THINK OF IT.  GOING TO IRAN, A TERRORIST STATE. I HAPPEN TO THINK THEY HAVE  PLENTY OF MONEY.  I HAPPEN TO THINK IT GOES INTO  THEIR ACCOUNTS IN SWITZERLAND, PERSONALLY.  THEY USE IT FOR TERROR.  IT IS THE NUMBER ONE TERROR FUNDER. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WHEN YOU HAVE 400 MILLION IN CASH,  DIFFERENT DENOMINATIONS. DID YOU SEE THE SIZE OF THIS?  THEY DID, I GUESS, RELEASE THE PICTURES AFTER ALL.  THEY RELEASED PICTURES. INTERESTING -- I SORT OF THINK IT GOES INTO BANK ACCOUNTS, RIGHT?  I SORT OF THINK THEY TAKE IT, THEY PROBABLY USE SOME FOR THIS,  SOME FOR THAT, CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS.  AND OBAMA SAID THAT HE DID IT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A WORKING ACCOUNT WITH IRAN. DO YOU BELIEVE IT? HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO SET UP AN ACCOUNT, RIGHT? YOU DON'T HAVE A WORKING ACCOUNT, YOU SET UP AN ACCOUNT, RIGHT, LAURA? YOU SET UP AN ACCOUNT. IT TAKES ABOUT -- WELL, LOOK. WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY -- FOLKS, FOLKS, WHAT'S GOING ON  IN THIS COUNTRY IS INSANE. AND WE HAVE PEOPLE RUNNING OUR COUNTRY THAT DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THEY'RE GROSSLY INCOMPETENT AND  IT'S TIME. WE HAVE TO MAKE CHANGE, REAL CHANGE.  NOT OBAMA CHANGE. WE HAVE TO MAKE CHANGE.   WHETHER IT'S SERGEANT BERGDAHL WHERE WE GET BERGDAHL, WHO WAS A TRAITOR AND THEY GET FIVE OF THE GREATEST KILLERS THAT THEY'VE WANTED FOR EIGHT YEARS.  I CALL IT THE FIVE FOR ONE TRADE. OR THE IRAN DEAL WHERE WE GET  NOTHING. WE GET NOTHING. ULTIMATELY THEY HAVE A BEAUTIFUL PATH. THEY'LL GET WAY, WAY EARLIER THEY'LL GET WAY, WAY EARLIER THAN THAT. THEY'LL GET NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  OH, IF YOU GET TRUMP, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF CHANGES TO  THAT DEAL. GOING TO HAPPEN FAST.  YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME BIG  CHANGES AND REALLY -- I SAW WHAT  PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID, THAT THE $400 MILLION IN CASH WAS NOT -- HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE  RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES, RIGHT?  IT REALLY DOESN'T WORK, DOES IT? DOES IT?  REMEMBER OBAMACARE?  YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP YOUR DOCTOR, YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP YOUR PLAN? OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  IT WAS A LIE AND IN FACT, IF HE  DIDN'T MAKE THE LIE, HE WOULD HAVE NEVER GOTTEN IT APPROVED BECAUSE MOST DEMOCRATS -- MANY  OF THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT.  IT WAS ONLY THAT THAT GOT THEM TO SIGN IT, TO APPROVE IT.  AND IT WAS A LIE.  AND THE $400 MILLION AND FROM  WHAT THE RUMOR IS AND FROM WHAT  THE REPORTS ARE, THE HOSTAGES  COULDN'T LEAVE THE AIRPORT UNTIL THIS OTHER PLANE ARRIVED.  THEY DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I THINK  WE ALL HAVE A PRETTY GOOD REASON WHY.  IT'S ALL A BIG LIE.  IT'S ALL A BIG LIE AND IT'S SO SAD TO SEE.  AND LET ME TELL YOU, HILLARY  CLINTON IS GOING TO BE FOUR MORE  YEARS OF OBAMA BUT MAYBE WORSE.   MAYBE WORSE.  GOING TO BE FOUR MORE YEARS.  FOUR MORE YEARS OF ISIS, FOUR  MORE YEARS OF HIGH TAXES.  YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY, I HAD A BIG  EVENT, REALLY.  TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY BIG EVENT IN DETROIT.  GOOD EVENT. VERY GOOD.  WE GOT WONDERFUL REVIEWS AND A  LOT OF GOOD COMMENTS. BUT THE THING I'M DOING, I'M  CUTTING TAXES BIG LEAGUE. ESPECIALLY FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS  AND ESPECIALLY FOR BUSINESSES, BECAUSE BUSINESSES ARE DYING.  THAT MEANS SMALL BUSINESSES, BUSINESSES, PERIOD.  BUSINESSES ARE LEAVING OUR COUNTRY LIKE THEY'VE NEVER LEFT BEFORE.  THEY'RE GOING ALL OVER.  THEY'RE GOING TO MEXICO, THAT I CAN TELL YOU. MEXICO IS LIKE THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN TELLING A STORY, A FRIEND OF MINE, GOOD FRIEND OF MINE, GOOD GUY.  HE BUILDS PLANTS FOR CARS, FOR COMPUTERS. MASSIVE PLANTS. AND I SAID TO HIM HOW ARE YOU DOING?  AND HE'S WORKED IN NORTH CAROLINA, BY THE WAY. I SAID TO HIM HOW ARE YOU DOING? HE SAID PHENOMENAL. IT'S LIKE I THINK THE BIGGEST IN THE WORLD AT THIS. THAT'S WHAT HE DOES. GREAT GUY. I SAID HOW'S IT ALL GOING? HE SAID YOU HAVE TO SEE MEXICO, DONALD.  IT'S THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD. WHAT WE'RE BUILDING THERE IS LIKE NEVER HAS BEEN BUILT. WE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE  IT. I SAID HOW ARE THINGS GOING IN THE UNITED STATES? I AM MORE INTERESTED IN THAT. AMERICA  FIRST, FOLKS, AMERICA FIRST.  DONALD TRUMP: AMERICA FIRST. WE GET A LITTLE  BYE-BYE.  THEY WERE SO QUIET.  I LIKE THE HILLARY PROTESTERS  BECAUSE THEY ARE SO QUIET.  THE BERNIE PROTESTERS HAVE A LOT  MORE SPIRIT.  I THINK WE WILL GET A LOT OF BERNIE VOTERS, IF YOU WANT TO  KNOW THE TRUTH, BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT TRADE IS KILLING THEM.  SO A FEW THINGS, A FEW OF THE  FACTS I WROTE, WHICH IS THE -- ONE IS THE 1.2% LOWEST -- FORGET  IT, PROBABLY MUCH HIGHER. WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED 1.2%, THAT  MEANS IT IS LOWER, AND 1.2% IS STARTING TO SET RECORDS. THE NATIONAL DEBT, ALMOST $20 TRILLION -- $20 TRILLION -- THE NATIONAL DEBT UNDER OBAMA HAS DOUBLED. FIGURE IT, DOUBLED. I THINK BY THE TIME HE GETS OUT, IT WILL MORE THAN DOUBLE, BUT WE HAVE TO BE ACCURATE BECAUSE THEY WILL SAY IT IS NOT QUITE DOUBLED. BELIEVE ME, BY THE TIME HE GETS OUT IT WILL HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED.  THE NATIONAL DEBT IS DOUBLED,  AND THE BAD PART OF THAT, YOU  THINK OF THE NATIONAL DEBT HAS  DOUBLED, OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, WE  WOULD HAVE BEAUTIFUL -- YOU SEE  WHERE 50% OF THE BRIDGES ARE IN DANGER IN THIS COUNTRY, AND THE  ROADWAYS ARE MESSED.  A FRIEND SAYS FOUR YEARS HE HAD NO PROBLEMS, AND HE HAS THESE  BIG TRUCKS BE IN THE WHEELS ARE  GETTING WIPED OUT BECAUSE OF  POTHOLES ON THE HIGHWAYS.  YOU THINK WITH THAT DOUBLING OF THE NATIONAL DEBT YOU WOULD GOOD  SHAPE FROM THE INFRASTRUCTURE  STANDPOINT, RIGHT?  WE ARE IN VERY BAD SHAPE.  U.S. TRADE DEFICIT, ALMOST $800 BILLION, NEARLY 24 MILLION  AMERICANS IN THEIR PRIME EARNING YEARS ARE OUT OF THE LABOR  FORCE, RIGHT?  IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS, ANOTHER 14 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE LEFT THE WORKFORCE.  THINK OF IT, THESE ARE THE REAL  NUMBERS, NOT THE 5% NONSENSE. YOU LOOK FOR A JOB, YOU CANNOT FIND YOUR JOB, YOU GO HOME, YOU  GO YOUR PARENTS, FRIENDS, DO WHATEVER.  YOU GAVE UP AND NOW YOU ARE CONSIDERED STATISTICALLY EMPLOYED.  THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT EMPLOYED. THESE PEOPLE ARE GREAT PEOPLE.  THERE ARE PLENTY OF THEM IN HERE.  WE HAVE GREAT PEOPLE, THE MOST LOYAL PEOPLE, THE SMARTEST PEOPLE.  SO MANY OF MY PEOPLE, THEY ARE SO SMART.  LIKE TO SAY, TRUMP -- I DO NOT KNOW IF HE HAS IT RIGHT --WE HAVE THE SMARTEST PEOPLE AND THE  BEST AND THE HARDEST WORKING. WE HAVE THE SMARTEST PEOPLE.  WE WILL PUT IQ'S AMONG SOME OF  US, YOU CAN SAY ALL OF US CAN AGAINST ANY OF THE IQ'S THAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH. I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT.  IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS, 14 MILLION PEOPLE, ONE IN FIVE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS DO NOT HAVE  A SINGLE MEMBER IN THE WORKFORCE. PRETTY BAD. HOME OWNERSHIP -- THIS IS ONE THAT IS AMAZING TO ME. TODAY HOME OWNERSHIP IS AT ITS LOWEST RATE IN 51 YEARS. YOU OWN HOMES, AND USED TO BE  THE DREAM TO OWN A HOME, RIGHT? THE AMERICAN HOME. LOWEST THAT IT HAS BEEN IN SO MANY YEARS. 51 YEARS. NEARLY 12 MILLION PEOPLE AND MORE AMERICANS ARE DEPENDENT ON FOOD STAMPS, AND 2 MILLION MORE LATINO AMERICANS LIVE IN POVERTY UNDER OBAMA AND CLINTON, UNDER OBAMA BECAUSE CLINTON IS GOING TO CARRY ON -- I DO NOT KNOW IF  YOU SAW, I GAVE A MASSIVE TAX  AND DECREASE YESTERDAY, BUT  CLINTON WILL DOUBLE UP YOUR  TAXES, AND SHE IS TRYING TO SAY  THAT SHE WILL DOUBLE UP YOUR TAXES.  YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE MASSIVE  TAX INCREASES IF CLINTON GETS IN.  ENJOY IT, FOLKS, IF YOU GET THAT.  51% OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH  ARE NOT EMPLOYED.  HOW SAD IS THAT?  AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS ARE EARNING $4000 LESS -- LISTEN TO THIS ONE -- TODAY THAN THEY WERE 16 YEARS AGO.  MANY WORKERS ARE EARNING LESS  THAN 1970 IN REAL DOLLARS.  1970 -- THAT IS A LONG TIME AGO.  THEY ARE EARNING IN REAL DOLLARS LESS MONEY.  SO UNDER MY PLAN, WE ARE GOING TO CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW AND  REALLY GOOD-PAYING JOBS.  IT IS INTERESTING, BECAUSE THE PRO-OBAMA PEOPLE SAY ABOUT THE  JOBS, THAT THEY ARE BAD JOBS.  I HAVE HEARD IT FROM MANY  PEOPLE, THEY ARE TRYING TO  DEFEND HIM, BUT THEY ARE BAD JOBS. THE GOOD JOBS HAVE LEFT. BUT WE WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW GOOD-PAYING JOBS, BUT GOOD  JOBS, IT IS SO IMPORTANT. IT IS SO IMPORTANT. EVERYONE'S TAXES WILL GO DOWN.  HILLARY CLINTON HAS SUPPORTED  TAX INCREASES ON THE MIDDLE  CLASS FOR HER ENTIRE CAREER. SHE HAS VOTED FOR HIGHER TAXES 235 TIMES IN THE SENATE. THAT IS ALL?  I THOUGHT IT WAS MORE THAN THAT. 235 TIMES. I HOPE THERE IS NOT A DECIMAL POINT IN THERE. I DO NOT THINK THERE IS. VOTED FOR HIGHER TAXES 235 TIMES IN THE SENATE. NOW SHE IS PLANNING ANOTHER JOB-KILLING $1.3 TRILLION TAX INCREASE.  THAT IS WHAT THE TAX INCREASE WILL BE, FOLKS. NOT LIKE YOU ARE NOT ALREADY PAYING ENOUGH?  SHE WILL BE TAXING BUSINESSES  THAT ARE ALREADY IN DEEP TROUBLE  OUT OF BUSINESS, THEN WE WILL  MAKE -- AND THIS IS SO IMPORTANT -- THIS WAS IVANKA TRUMP, SO  GREAT, SO GREAT.  WE'RE GOING TO MAKE CHILDCARE  EXPENSES TAX-DEDUCTIBLE FOR  WORKING FAMILIES.  AND JUST MANY, MANY OTHER  THINGS, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SOME UNBELIEVABLE CHANGES, AND  IT IS SO EASY.  REGULATIONS -- I AM TRAVELING  ALL OVER AND MEETING WITH  BUSINESS OWNERS, EVEN PEOPLE WHO  ARE BEING LAID OFF BECAUSE OF THIS.  REGULATIONS -- IF I TOLD YOU,  AND I'M SO SURPRISED -- THIS IS  THE BIGGEST PRIZE -- IF YOU HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS AND I CAN SAY  YOU HAVE ONE OF THE OTHER, A  MAJOR TAX CUT LIKE WE ARE GOING  TO BRING IT DOWN TO 15% FROM MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT -- BUT IF  I TOLD YOU THAT YOU COULD HAVE A MASSIVE TAX DECREASE OR REALLY  SUBSTANTIALLY -- BUT IN A REAL WAY, CUT REGULATIONS, 100% OF  THE PEOPLE I WOULD TALK TO WOULD  TAKE THE REGULATIONS, IF YOU COULD HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER. IT IS AMAZING, THAT SURPRISED ME. IT SURPRISED TO THEM, TOO.  100% -- EVERYBODY -- BUSINESSES CANNOT FORM ANYMORE. REGULATORY BURDEN IS SO  INCREDIBLE THAT YOU CANNOT FORM BUSINESSES -- VERY HARD -- AND  BUSINESSES IN EXISTENCE ARE BEING PUT OUT OF EXISTENCE FOR  REGULATIONS THAT DO NOT DO ANYTHING. WE WANT SAFETY REGULATIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. WE ARE NOT PEOPLE THAT DO NOT WANT THESE THINGS. WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT. WE WANT CLEAN AIR, CLEAN WATER. WE WANT CLEAN WATER. BUT TO DO THAT -- AND THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO  DO, BUT TO DO THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY AND OUR BUSINESSES. SO I JUST WROTE THIS DOWN TODAY. HILLARY WANTS TO RAISE TAXES.  THIS IS A COMPARISON.  I WANT TO LOWER THEM.  HILLARY WANTS TO EXPAND  REGULATIONS, WHICH SHE DOES  VAGUELY, CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?  I WILL REDUCE THEM VERY, VERY  SUBSTANTIALLY, 50%, AS MUCH AS 70%, 75%. HILLARY WANTS TO SHUT DOWN ENERGY PRODUCTION. I WANT TO EXPAND IT. LOWER ELECTRIC, LOWER ELECTRIC. HILLARY WANTS TO ESSENTIALLY ABOLISH THE SECOND AMENDMENT.  IF SHE GETS TO PICK HER JUDGES,  NOTHING YOU CAN DO, FOLKS.  ALTHOUGH THE SECOND AMENDMENT  PEOPLE -- MAYBE THERE IS -- I DON'T KNOW. BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, THAT WILL BE A HORRIBLE DAY IF  HILLARY GETS TO PUT HER JUDGES -- RIGHT NOW WE ARE TIED. YOU SEE WHAT IS GOING ON,  BECAUSE -- SCALIA -- THIS WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.  JUSTICE SCALIA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AROUND FOR 10 MORE YEARS AT  LEAST, AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.  THAT WAS A HORRIBLE THING.  SO NOW LOOK AT IT, SO HILLARY  ESSENTIALLY WANTS TO ABOLISH THE SECOND AMENDMENT.  SPEAKING TO THE NRA FOLKS, WHO ARE GREAT.  WHEN YOU -- AND I WILL TELL YOU, SO THEY ENDORSED ME, THEY  ENDORSED ME VERY EARLY. MY SONS ARE MEMBERS. I AM A MEMBER. I THINK WE CAN -- AT THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION, THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO THE JUSTICES, THEY ALMOST GO IN A  CERTAIN WAY HAND IN HAND. THE JUSTICES ARE GOING TO DO THINGS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT, AND WE HAVE SUCH GREAT JUSTICES. YOU SEE MY LIST OF 11 THAT HAD BEEN VETTED AND ARE RESPECTED  AND GOTTEN GREAT, AND A LITTLE  BIT EQUATE -- BUT IF YOU DO NOT DO WHAT IS THE RIGHT THING, YOU  ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A SECOND AMENDMENT, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE MUCH OF IT LEFT, AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT YOURSELVES, WHAT YOU NEED.  WHEN THE BAD GUYS BURST INTO YOUR HOUSE, THEY ARE NOT LOOKING ABOUT SECOND AMENDMENT AND DO I HAVE A RIGHT TO DO THIS, OK?  THE BAD GUYS ARE NOT GOING TO BE GIVING UP THEIR WEAPONS, BUT THE  GOOD PEOPLE WILL SAY, OH, WELL, THAT'S THE LAW. NO, NO, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO HAVE TOTALLY OPEN BORDERS WHERE PEOPLE FLOW INTO OUR COUNTRY AND THEY TAKE YOUR JOBS AND THEY DO  LOTS OF THINGS. AND I WANT PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY, BUT THEY HAVE TO DO IT, A DIRECT PROCESS, THEY HAVE  TO DO IT LEGALLY, RIGHT? SO YOU HAVE DRUGS POURING IN, YOU HAVE EVERYTHING COMING IN. IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, GREAT STATE, THEY HAVE A TREMENDOUS HEROIN PROBLEM.  WE WILL STOP THE DRUGS POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY FROM THE  SOUTHERN BORDER.  AND BY THE WAY, WE WILL BUILD A  WALL --   WALLS DO WORK. WALLS DO WORK.  HERE IS ONE -- GEE, DOESN'T LOOK THAT WAY, BUT SHE IS.  HILLARY WANTS TO INVADE FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  I SPENT -- FOR TWO YEARS, THREE YEARS I HAVE BEEN SAYING WE HAVE SPENT $2 TRILLION.  I WILL GET THE ACCURATE NUMBER.  THEY DO NOT KNOW THE ACCURATE NUMBER.  THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE ARE SENDING EQUIPMENT OVER AND THE ENEMY IS TAKING IT. WE SENT OVER 2300 HUMVEES THAT  ARE ARMOR PLATED.  I THOUGHT THAT MEANT LIKE TWO OR  23 OR 230 WAS TOO MUCH.  2300 HUMVEES AND THEY GOT STOLEN, TAKEN BY THE ENEMY.  THE SO-CALLED ALLIES, WE HAVE THESE GREAT ALLIES WE ALWAYS END UP BEING WORSE THAN THE GUYS WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT -- SO TERRIBLE. HILLARY AND PRESIDENT OBAMA  REFUSE TO USE THE TERM ""RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM."" BIG PROBLEM, BIG PROBLEM. HILLARY WANTS TO RELEASE VIOLENT CRIMINALS AND CRIMINAL OFFENDERS FROM PRISON. ENJOY YOURSELVES. I WANT TO WORK WITH OUR POLICE. OUR POLICE ARE SO INCREDIBLE. THEY DO NOT GET THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE. NOT GETTING THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE. AND WE ARE GOING TO IN OUR COUNTRY RESTORE LAW AND ORDER. WE HAVE TO.  WE HAVE TO RESTORE LAW AND ORDER. AND THE POLICE WILL BE CAREFUL AND STUDIED, BUT WHAT HAPPENED IN DALLAS, WHERE ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE SHOT DOWN, ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY FOR NO REASON VICIOUSLY SHOT DOWN, AND SO MANY OTHERS. I WAS WITH ONE OF THE POLICE GROUPS THE OTHER DAY, THEY ARE ENDORSING ME, AND I SAID THAT WAS TERRIBLE IN DALLAS, AND THEY GAVE ME A LIST OF EIGHT OTHER STATES IN THE LAST WHILE WHERE THE SAME SMALLER NUMBER, BUT THE  SAME THING WAS HAPPENING, WHERE POLICE ARE BEING KILLED. WE HAVE TO RESPECT AND CHERISH OUR POLICE.  SCHOOL CHOICE WE WANT.  COMMON CORE WE DO NOT WANT.  WE GOT TO GET RID OF COMMON CORE.  BRING EDUCATION -- AND, FOLKS, WE HAVE TO  RENEGOTIATE WITH NAFTA.  GOING BACK TO THE WALL, MEXICO  IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL.  THAT I CAN TELL YOU.  YOU KNOW, THESE POLITICIANS, YOU  DO NOT KNOW ME, THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME, AND I AM.  I MET A GROUP OF 50 PEOPLE WHO  HAVE BEEN RUNNING OUR COUNTRY  FOREVER AND THEY SAID WE CANNOT  SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP.  THE REASON -- BECAUSE I AM NOT GOING TO HIRE THESE PEOPLE, I DO NOT WANT TO THESE PEOPLE.  TAKE A LOOK.  TAKE A LOOK AT THESE PEOPLE,  THESE ARE SORT OF LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED  WITH WASHINGTON, MAKING  DECISIONS MILITARILY, ON  DEFENSE, TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAS  HAPPENED TO OUR COUNTRY.  OUR MILITARY IS DEPLETED.  OUR VETS ARE NOT BEING TAKEN CARE OF.  WE CANNOT BEAT ISIS.  CAN YOU IMAGINE GENERAL GEORGE  PATTON, SPINNING IN HIS GRAVE,  THE GREAT DOUGLAS MCARTHUR, AND  WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS  MILITARY STATE, AND I LOVE IT -- I LOVE IT.  AND YOU IMAGINE THEM SEEING THAT WE CANNOT BEAT THESE 25,000 OR 30,000 PEOPLE? WE ARE FIGHTING A POLITICALLY CORRECT WAR. POLITICALLY CORRECT WAR? YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON.  YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON.  THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT CHOP OFF HEADS. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT IN STEEL CAGES -- DROP STEEL CAGES INTO THE WATER AND DROWN LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT BURY PEOPLE IN THE SAND. WE GOT TO KNOCK THEM OUT. I WAS AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE WAR IN IRAQ. THEY DESTABILIZED THE MIDDLE  EAST, BUT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE  GOTTEN OUT THE WAY WE GOT OUT. THE WAY WE GOT OUT WAS INSANE. AND OBAMA GAVE A DATE, AND THAT IS HOW ISIS HAPPENED, FOLKS! HENCE, THE BIRTH OF ISIS, CONGRATULATIONS, HILLARY CLINTON. SHE SHOULD GET -- IF I AM ISIS, I'LL CALL HER UP AND I GIVE HER THE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER AWARD, OK? AND I GUARANTEE YOU, WITH LIBYA, WHICH WAS HER BABY, AND ALL THE OTHER MISTAKES SHE HAS MADE, OBAMA TALKS NOW, BECAUSE  OBVIOUSLY FOR HIM THAT IS THE BETTER ALTERNATIVE, ALL RIGHT? BUT HE HAS BEEN AN INCOMPETENT PRESIDENT.  HE HAS DONE A HORRIBLE JOB.  AND I GUARANTEE YOU THAT IF HE  HAD IT TO DO AGAIN AND HE WOULD  ONLY SAY THIS TO HIS WIFE, BUT  HE IF HE HAD TO DO IT AGAIN, HE  WOULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN HILLARY  CLINTON TO BE HIS SECRETARY OF  STATE, BECAUSE SHE MADE SO MANY  HORRIBLE MISTAKES AND COST SO  MANY LIVES, AND I MEAN LIVES ON BOTH SIDES.  I MEAN LIVES ON BOTH SIDES.  SHE IS INEPT.  SHE IS INEPT.  TO THINK SHE IS ALLOWED TO RUN  FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES WHEN SHE DELETED 33,000  E-MAILS, IT WILL ALWAYS BE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR COUNTRY.  IT ALWAYS WILL BE.  SO I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE.  LOOK, I AM GOING TO BE AROUND, WE ARE GOING TO BE COMING AROUND TO NORTH CAROLINA A LOT.  GOT A WIN IT, IMPORTANT.  PEOPLE ARE GREAT.  MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW COMES FROM NORTH CAROLINA.  I AM HERE ALL THE TIME.  BUT PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE ARE GREAT, THE MILITARY IS GREAT.  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING.  WE ARE GOING TO PUT AMERICA FIRST.  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.  BUT NEVER, EVER FORGET WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  THANK YOU. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. I WILL BE BACK SOON. THANK YOU.  GOD BLESS YOU.","Donald Trump Campaign Event in Wilmington, North Carolina"

IF YOU WEAKER TONIGHT, FIND YOUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS WHO DO COME STUDY THIS IS. CHANGE VERSUS THE STATUS QUO. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN ELECT SOMEONE WHO LITERALLY PERSONIFIES THE FAILED ESTABLISHMENT. AN ESTABLISHMENT NOW THAT FOR FAR TOO LONG HAS BEEN TROUBLED BY FOLKS WHO ARE USED TO SAYING ONE THING AND DOING ANOTHER WHILE THEY FILE A MOUNTAIN RANGE OF DEBT ON OUR CHILDREN AND  GRANDCHILDREN. OR WE CAN DO WHAT YOU ALL HAVE DONE AND COME NOVEMBER WE CAN CHOOSE A LEADER, A TRUTH TELLER, SOMEONE WHO WILL STAND STRONG ON THE WORLD STAGE AND FIGHT EVERY DAY TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  I SAY IT IS MY HIGH HONOR AND DISTINCT PRIVILEGE FOR THE SAKE OF OUR TROOPS WHO DESERVE A  COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO WILL HAVE THEIR BACK, FOR THE SAKE OF HARD-WORKING AMERICANS AND BUSINESSES WHO DESERVE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL GET WASHINGTON, D.C. OFF THEIR BACK, FOR THE SAKE OF A SUPREME COURT THAT WILL NEVER TURN ITS BACK ON  OUR GOD-GIVEN LIBERTY OR CONSTITUTION, I GIVE YOU THE MAN WHO MUST BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF  AMERICA,  DONALD TRUMP.   MR. TRUMP: SO HOW GOOD IS HE?  SPECIAL. HE IS A SPECIAL MAN.  AND HE HAS BECOME MY FRIEND. A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE.  HELLO, EVERYBODY. YOUR FOOTBALL TEAM IS GOING TO HAVE A GREAT YEAR.  I WATCHED. THE OTHER QUARTERBACK IN THE WHOLE DEAL.  I THINK IT WILL BE A VERY GOOD YEAR.  IF YOU GET INTO THAT SUPER BOWL,  I WILL BE GOING. I WROTE SOMETHING DOWN BEFORE AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT, I LOVE YOU TOO.  BECAUSE WE NEED UNITY, WE HAVE TO WIN THIS ELECTION.  THIS IS TRULY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTIONS, CERTAINLY  IN MY LIFETIME.  WE ARE ABOUT TO GO, WE ARE IN  THE WRONG DIRECTION IF WE LOOSE AND MAYBE IT IS GONE.  SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, ALWAYS  REMEMBER THAT.  SOMEBODY DIFFERENT LEVELS, WHEN YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED WITH CROOKED HILLARY TODAY, IT WAS A DISASTER.  SHE HAD A DISASTER.  SHE LIES.  I WANTED TO SAY TO THE GROUP, I HAD A GREAT TIME WHEN I WAS IN WISCONSIN AND I DID NOT QUITE  EKE IT OUT.  I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BUT IT  WORKED OUT.  YOU BUILD ME UP, TALKED TO ME ABOUT POLITICS, AND WHEN I LEFT HERE, I SAID I THINK I LEARNED A LOT.  I LOVED IT. I HAVE MANY FRIENDS IN WISCONSIN. THEIR INCREDIBLE PEOPLE WE ARE  GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF FUN. THIS CAMPAIGN IS NOT ABOUT ME OR  ANY ONE CANDIDATE. IT IS ABOUT AMERICA.  IT IS TIME FOR A CHANGE. WE NEED A CHANGE. A REAL CHANGE, NOT AN OBAMA  CHANGE. WE DON'T NEED AN OBAMA CHANGE. WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH.  IT IS TIME TO CHANGE A RATE  POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT WORKS -- RIGGED POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT WORKS ONLY FOR THE INSIDERS AND  REPLACE IT WITH A GOVERNMENT  THAT SERVES THE PEOPLE.  I'VE BEEN ON THE OTHER SIDE.  THIS IS A MOVEMENT.  THIS IS A MOVEMENT LIKE THEY MAY  HAVE NEVER SEEN IN THIS COUNTRY. THIS IS A MOVEMENT THAT SOME SAY IS ONE OF THE GREAT PHENOMENA'S  THEY'VE EVER SEEN IN POLITICS.  THE MEDIA DOESN'T WANT TO TALK  ABOUT IT, WE HAVE DONE  SOMETHING, I'M A MESSENGER. WE HAVE DONE SOMETHING TRULY A -- HISTORIC TOGETHER, STANDING  BEFORE YOU AS NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT AND I'M NOT A POLITICIAN.  I'M NOT PART OF THE SYSTEM. I'M PROBABLY BETTER OFF RUNNING AGAINST THE SYSTEM. I RAN AGAINST THE DONORS. I MY OWN DONOR ESSENTIALLY. I HAVE A LOT OF MONEY UNDER THIS DEAL. THIS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE CRISIS. I FUNDED THE PRIMARY. $60 MILLION. I'M LARGELY PUT IN THE CAMPAIGN AS A GO FORWARD. WE HAVE RAISED TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND MUCH OF IT FROM SMALL DONORS. $61. AS A REPUBLICAN, THAT DOES NOT  HAPPEN. IT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU  ARE SEEING TODAY.  DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT REALLY DONE  TOO WELL WITH FUNDRAISING.  THAT IS BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW  IF I WAS GETTING THE NOMINATION.  I WILL NOT RAISE FUND, I WOULD'VE HAD ENOUGH.  I WOULD HAVE SAID BYE-BYE  POLITICS.  BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY DOES NOT WIN ANYMORE. OUR COUNTRY DOES NOT WIN ANYMORE. AND IT IS NOT GOING TO WIN WITH  CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON. SHE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO WIN.  OUR COUNTRY WILL NOT WIN WITH HER. WE WILL BE WORSE THAN WE ARE  WITH OBAMA.  IF YOU WANT FOUR MORE YEARS OF  WHAT IS GOING ON, ISIS, ISIS EXPANDING.  BY THE WAY, OUR POLICEMAN ARE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE.    AND WE ARE NOT GOING  TO ALLOW OUR POLICEMAN TO BE  SHOT DOWN ANYMORE.  ANYMORE. NO MORE. NO MORE. SO, NOVEMBER 8, YOU HAVE A BIG ELECTION.  I PROMISE YOU THIS, IF I WIN, WE'RE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN ON TRADE. WE'RE GOING TO WIN WITH OUR MILITARY. WE WILL TAKE OUT ISIS. WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOR VETERANS WHO HAVE BEEN TOTALLY MISTREATED.  OUR VETERANS ARE GREAT. WE HAVE A GREAT PLAN FOR OUR VETERANS. WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOR VETERANS, FOR THE FIRST TIME MAYBE EVER. , WE ARE GOING TO WIN ON TRADE DEALS. WE WILL MAKE THE FINEST, BRING OUR JOBS BACK. WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT EASY FOR THESE COMPANIES TO LEAVE AND FIRE EVERYBODY.  IT WILL BE VERY EXPENSIVE WHEN THEY DO IT. BELIEVE ME. IT WILL BE VERY EXPENSIVE.

WE HAVE HAD AN INTERESTING PERIOD OF TIME.  WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A GOOD  EVENING LAST NIGHT WATCHING. RIGHT?  NO? THE NUMBERS JUST CAME OUT FOR  THE BIG THURSDAY. THEY CALL IT BIG THURSDAY. WHERE I SPOKE LAST WEEK AND HILLARY, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS CROOKED HILLARY, SPOKE LAST NIGHT.   SHE IS CROOKED. AND WE HAD, I THINK IT WAS 35 MILLION AND THEY HAD LESS.  LIKE 33 OR SOMETHING. IN OTHER WORDS, WE HAD MORE. AND I HAVE SORT OF BEEN SAYING THAT.  AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, BOTH NUMBERS ARE GREAT NUMBERS. DON'T FORGET, ON THE DEBATE, IT WAS 24 MILLION AND THAT WAS A RECORD.  WHEN YOU HAVE 35 MILLION PEOPLE  WATCHING YOUR CONVENTION, THOSE  ARE BIG, BIG NUMBERS. BUT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION  OUTDREW THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION ON THE BIG THURSDAY  NIGHT.  ALWAYS GOOD.  ALWAYS GOOD.  OK. SO, WE HAVE TO GO OVER SOME  NUMBERS, BECAUSE HILLARY WAS  TALKING LAST NIGHT ABOUT HOW  WONDERFUL EVERYTHING IS.  SHE DID NOT TALK ABOUT ALL OF  THE UNBELIEVABLE LONG-TERM  UNEMPLOYMENT. SHE DID NOT TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT HOUSE OWNERSHIP IS THE  LOWEST IT HAS BEEN IN 51 YEARS. THAT IS A HECK OF A NUMBER. WHOEVER HEARD OF THAT? SHE DID NOT TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAD MORE POLICE SHOOTINGS OVER THE LAST YEAR THAN, I MEAN, NO ONE HAS EVER  SEEN ANYTHING LIKE WHAT IS GOING  ON. OVER 50%. OVER 50% FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. SHE MAKES IT SOUND LIKE EVERYTHING IS ROSY DORY. IT IS NOT.  PEOPLE ARE POOR AND ACROSS THE BORDER, WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE, PEOPLE ARE COMING IN FROM SYRIA AND YOU SEE WHAT IS  HAPPENING WITH NICE IN THE BELOVED PRIEST. 85-YEAR-OLD PRIEST, HE HAS HIS  THROAT SLIT AND DIES.  AND YOU KNOW WHAT? OUR COUNTRY HAS ENOUGH PROBLEMS.  WE DON'T NEED MORE PROBLEMS AND  THAT IS GOING TO BE MORE PROBLEMS.  NOW, YOU KNOW, SHOULD WE READ  THE SNAKE? SHOULD WE? DOES ANYONE KNOW THE SNAKE?  SHOULD WE DO IT?  OK.  WHO HAS HEARD IT BEFORE? BECAUSE EVERYBODY SAYS, WOULD  YOU DO IT? WHO HAS HEARD IT? LET ME PUT IT DIFFERENTLY. WHO HAS NOT HEARD IT?  A LOT OF PEOPLE.  OK. BEFORE WE DO THAT, WE WILL DO  IT. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, SO LAST NIGHT WAS SORT OF UNBELIEVABLE. I WENT HOME AND I THOUGHT THAT HILLARY WAS NOT GOING TO MENTION  FROM. BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE CLASS THING TO DO. SHE MENTIONED ME 22 TIMES. 22. TWO THINGS, IT WAS A LITTLE BIT  ON THE BORING SIDE, WOULDN'T YOU  SAY? SO, NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE, I DON'T THINK IT REGISTER. WE'RE GOING TO SEE. YOU KNOW, WITH THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION, I GOT A VERY GOOD  BOUNCE.  ONE OF THE BIGGEST BOUNCES IN  MANY YEARS.  RIGHT? WE WILL HAVE TO SEE. WE WILL HAVE TO SEE.  WE WILL HAVE TO SEE. BECAUSE, THE SPEECH WAS REALLY  LIES. YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS SHE TALKED ABOUT WITH THE  ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE CAMPAIGN.  YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?  THIS IS A SPEECHWRITER, WRITING A SPEECH, AND SHE READ IT, AND THAT IS WHAT IT IS. AND I HATE TO SAY THIS, POLITICO WROTE SOMETHING. POLITICO, THEY KILL ME ALL THE  TIME, VERY UNFAIR. RUBS BUT THEY WROTE SOMETHING. THEY SAID IT WAS CLICHE AFTER CLICHE.AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY SAID, TOUGH AND TUMBLE CAMPAIGN, A TOUGH AND TUMBLE CAMPAIGN. NOW, WE HAVE CREATED A MOVEMENT. IN THE MOVEMENTS -- NOBODY HAS SEEN, LOOK, I MEAN,  LOOK AT THIS PLACE. LOOK AT IT.   NOBODY HAS SEEN  ANYTHING LIKE THIS. WHAT IS THAT BEHIND ME? THAT IS PRETTY TOP-LOOKING. THAT IS PRETTY TOUGH-LOOKING. WE CREATED A MOVEMENT. AND EVERYBODY SAYS THIS IS WHEN THE GREAT CAMPAIGNS THAT HAVE EVER SEEN.  I MEAN, LOOK, YOU WERE THE  FORGOTTEN MAN AND WOMAN. I WAS THE GUY THAT NEVER DID THIS BEFORE. I HAVE HAD GREAT SUCCESS. I HAVE ENJOYED MY LIFE. I HAVE A WONDERFUL FAMILY. BY THE WAY, DID MY FAMILY DO A GOOD JOB?  RIGHT? THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE STAR  POWER.  WE KNOW ABOUT STAR POWER. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE STAR POWER THEY HAD AT THE DEMOCRAT CONVENTION.  IT SHOULD BE DEMOCRAT  CONVENTION. SOUNDS BETTER WHEN YOU SAY DEMOCRATIC. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE STAR  POWER. I THINK MY KIDS HAVE MORE STAR POWER, I REALLY DO. THEY HAD A GENERAL NAMED JOHN ALLEN, I NEVER MET HIM, AND HE GOT UP AND STARTED TALKING ABOUT TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP. HE IS A FAILED GENERAL.  HE WAS THE GENERAL FIGHTING  ISIS. I WOULD SAY HE HAS NOT DONE SO WELL. AND THEY HAD OTHER PEOPLE, WHAT  DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? IT WAS HIT AFTER HIT AFTER HIT. I WILL HIT THEM BACK SO HARD. I AM GOING TO GET THEM BACK SO HARD -- HIT THEM BACK SO HARD  AND I WILL DO IT VERBALLY, ON TELEVISION, TWITTER. FACEBOOK AND TWITTER, 22 MILLION  PEOPLE. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? THAT IS A FORCE. THE LAST DAY, WE PICKED UP 100,000.  WE WILL HIT THEM BACK SO FAR -- SO HARD AND CNN THAT TRUMP IS  GOING TO HIT THEM. I MEAN, I WILL HIT THEM WITH THIS, VERBALLY. ""TRUMP HITTING"" --THESE PEOPLE  ARE SO DISHONEST. A FRIEND OF MINE CALLS ME UP AND  HE IS A GOVERNOR, A GREAT GOVERNOR. YOU KNOW, WE HAD GUYS AND PEOPLE  THAT SAID REALLY BAD THINGS  ABOUT ME AND HE SAID, DO NOT DO ANYTHING. YOU GOT THE NOMINATION.  YOU WILL BEAT HILLARY CLINTON. FOCUS ON HILLARY CLINTON.  I REALLY WANT TO HIT BACK. I MEAN THIS. I WANT TO FIT THEM. WE WILL DO A VERBAL LASHING ON THEM AND HE SAID, DON'T DO IT. DON'T DO IT. MAYBE I WILL DO JUST A LITTLE BIT, RIGHT? WE JUST LEFT TO OTHER PARTS OF COLORADO -- TWO OTHER PARTS OF COLORADO, WHICH IS A GREAT  STATE. I AM HERE A LOT ANYWAY. I HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS HERE. WE HAVE TO WIN THE STATE ON  NOVEMBER 8.  WE HAVE TO. AND I AM GOING TO BE HERE A LOT. I WILL BE HERE SO MUCH THAT YOU  PEOPLE WILL SAY, WE WILL VOTE  FOR YOU, DO NOT COME BACK HERE  ANYMORE. WE WILL HAVE SOME FUN. I ENJOYED WATCHING IT LAST  NIGHT.  HOW WAS HILLARY? AVERAGE. NOT BAD, NOT GOOD.  A LOT OF SHOUTING. NOT THE MOST EXCITING SPEECH. WHO SPEECH WAS BETTER -- WHO'S A  SPEECH WAS BETTER -- MINE OR HERS? YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, THE HATERS, THE WORLD'S MOST DISHONEST.  THEY ARE THE WORLD'S MOST DISHONEST PEOPLE. SHOW THEM THE CROWD OVER THERE. SHOW THEM THE CROWD. WE HAVE UNBELIEVABLE PEOPLE AND  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I GOT A KICK LAST NIGHT -- GO AHEAD.  IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE WATCHING  A BIG FOOTBALL GAME, RIGHT? DENVER! GOOD TEAM, GOOD DEFENSE. YOU KNOW WHAT, JOHN ELWAY IS A GREAT GUY. I PLAYED GOLF WITH HIM A LONG  TIME AGO. HE IS LONG AND STRONG. GREAT DEFENSE AND I THINK YOU  WILL DO GREAT, RIGHT? MY WIFE WILL ALWAYS SAY,  DARLING, DID YOU HAVE A BIG CROWD TONIGHT? THEY NEVER SHOW THE CROWD BUT IT SOUNDS IT. YOU CANNOT IMITATE THAT NOISE  WITH 100 PEOPLE. AMAZING. YOU CANNOT IMITATE THAT. THAT IS CALLED THE REAL DEAL. NO MATTER WHERE WE GO, WE HAVE CROWDS. THE CROWDS ARE ONLY RESTRAINT BY  THE SIZE OF THE BUILDINGS. -- RESTRAINED BY THE SIZE OF THE  BUILDINGS. WHEN I HEARD SOME OF THE  STATISTICS LAST NIGHT, AND I  THOUGHT CHELSEA DID A NICE JOB. CHELSEA LIKES YVONNE GOT ANDY BANCA -- CHELSEA LIKES IVANKA AND IVANKA LIKES CHELSEA. THEY LIKE EACH OTHER. I THOUGHT CHELSEA DID A NICE JOB LAST NIGHT.  I REALLY DID.  HILLARY, THAT IS ANOTHER SUBJECT. HILLARY SAID ALL SORTS OF  WONDERFUL THINGS LIKE WE ARE DOING GREAT.  HERE ARE NUMBERS THAT CAME OUT TODAY. WE GOT NEW GROWTH NUMBERS. 1.2 PERCENT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER. THIS IS THE WEAKEST RECOVERY IN  MODERN HISTORY.  DID SHE SAY THAT LAST NIGHT?  I DON'T THINK SO.  I SAID THIS BEFORE, THE RATE OF HOME OWNERSHIP IS THE LOWEST LEVEL IT HAS BEEN IN 51 YEARS. DID HILLARY SAY THAT LAST NIGHT? UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA, KEEP THE LIGHTS OFF, IT JUST WENT DOWN 20 DEGREES. WOW. THE AUDIENCE IS EVEN BIGGER NOW. I LIKE THIS. I MISS MY PROTESTERS. YOU KNOW, MY PROTESTERS, THEY WERE REALLY BERNIE PROTESTERS. LOOK AT THAT.  LOOK AT THAT. IT IS THE REMNANTS OF A BERNIE PROTESTER. THAT IS OK. DID YOU SEE BERNIE LAST NIGHT, HOW ANGRY HE WAS? I DO NOT LIKE TO SEE THAT.  HE WAS SO ANGRY, THEY WERE  TALKING ABOUT HIM, AND HE WAS SCOWLING AND HIS WIFE PUT HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER AND HE DID NOT MOVE AND SHE TOOK IT OFF. HE SOLD HIS SOUL TO THE DEVIL. HE SOLD HIS SOUL TO THE DEVIL. HE SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE THAT DEAL.  AS SOON AS SHE PICKED THIS VICE PRESIDENT -- DO YOU KNOW WHAT  HIS FIRST MOVE WAS IN VIRGINIA? RAISE TAXES BY $4 BILLION. UNEMPLOYMENT ALMOST DOUBLED IN  VIRGINIA WHILE HE WAS GOVERNOR. HE IS NOT POPULAR IN VIRGINIA NOW. AND WE WILL WIN VIRGINIA. I HAVE A LOT OF PROPERTY IN  VIRGINIA. I HAVE A LOT OF EMPLOYEES. I THINK -- I FIGURED SHE WOULD PICK SOMEBODY WHO WAS POPULAR.  THEY DO NOT LIKE HIM IN VIRGINIA.  HE RAISED TAXES BY $4 BILLION  THE FIRST WEEK IN VIRGINIA. I LIKE OUR CANDIDATE, RIGHT? GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE. INDIANA HAS DONE SO WELL. WE LIKE MIKE. WE DO. MIKE IS A GREAT GUY. THE RATE OF HOME OWNERSHIP IS  THE LOWEST IT HAS BEEN IN 51 YEARS.  PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DOUBLED OUR  NATIONAL DEBT. WE WILL SOON BE UP TO $22 BILLION. THE U.S. TRADE DEFICIT -- EMPTY  BILLION DOLLARS -- 20 TRILLION  DOLLARS.  I HAVE A VERY GOOD MEMORY. PEOPLE KNOW ME FOR MY MEMORY. OR I COULD NOT DO THIS WITHOUT TELEPROMPTERS. SHE HAS 10 PEOPLE IN A ROOM AND  SHE HAS A TELEPROMPTER.  LISTEN TO THIS. THE U.S. TRADE DEFICIT REACHED NEARLY $800 BILLION LAST YEAR. WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT OF HATE HUNDRED BILLION -- 800 BILLION.  DID HILLARY MENTION THAT LAST NIGHT? DID HILLARY MENTION ABOUT ALL OF THE POLICE -- AND WE LOVE OUR POLICE AND WE LOVE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT --   DID HILLARY MENTION ABOUT ALL OF THE POLICE THAT HAVE BEEN SHOT? I DON'T THINK SO. DID YOU SEE THE FIRST NIGHT,  THERE WAS NO AMERICAN FLAG? THE SECOND NIGHT, NO AMERICAN FLAG. THEY DO NOT REALLY WANT THE  FLAG. THE NEXT NIGHT -- THE FINAL NIGHT, THEY OVERDID IT. SO MANY FLAGS YOU COULD NOT WALK  ON THE STAGE. THEY DID NOT MENTION THE POLICE. THEY MENTIONED EVERYBODY BUT THE  POLICE. THEY MENTION THEM THE FINAL NIGHT. LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT IS THE  WORST IT HAS BEEN SINCE THE 1940'S. DID HILLARY MENTION NOT LAST NIGHT? -- MENTION THAT LAST NIGHT? 2823.8 MILLION AMERICANS IN THEIR PRIME EARNING YEARS ARE NOW OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE. ANOTHER 14 MILLION AMERICANS  LEFT THE LABOR FORCE. NEARLY FOUR IN 10 AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE  LIVING IN POVERTY. 58% OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH  ARE NOT EMPLOYED. OBAMA HAS DONE A GREAT JOB, HAS AND HE? -- HASN'T HE QUESTION MAR? MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME HAS FALLEN BY MORE THAN $4000. WE HAVE PEOPLE STANDING IN THIS ROOM WHO MADE MORE MONEY IN REAL WAGES 18 YEARS AGO THAN THEY ARE MAKING TODAY. THEY DID NOT WORK AS HARD, HELL  OF A LOT YOUNGER.  IT SHOULD BE THE OTHER WAY AROUND. WE LOST OUR JOBS, LOST OUR COMPANIES, AND WE WILL NOT LET IT HAPPEN ANYMORE. WE WILL GET OUR JOBS BACK, BRING COMPANIES BACK, WE WILL NOT LET OUR COMPANIES LEAVE ANYMORE WITHOUT REPERCUSSIONS. I COULD GO ON AND ON, BUT THERE ARE FIVE PAGES AND I DO NOT WANT  TO DEPRESS YOU. THEY SAID DONALD TRUMP SPEECH --  I THOUGHT I DELIVERED IT WHILE. -- DELIVERED IT WELL. THEY SAID IT WAS DARK. THEY SAID IT WAS DARK. IT WAS NOT DARK.  IT WAS OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE I  TALKED ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND WE  WILL FIX THE PROBLEM. RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM IS A  PROBLEM. BIG PROBLEM. THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM. RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. HILLARY DID NOT DISCUSS THAT TOO  MUCH. WE ARE BRINGING IN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM SYRIA.  WE DO NOT KNOW WHO THEY ARE.  WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY COME  FROM. NO PAPERWORK, NO WAY OF VETTING THEM AND THEY ARE BEING PLACED HERE, ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, AND MOSTLY THE OFFICIALS DO NOT KNOW  WHERE THEY ARE PLACING THEM  BECAUSE IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A BIG AND BEAUTIFUL SECRET. HILLARY CLINTON HAS STATED VERY STRONGLY -- NOW SHE WILL CHANGE. NOW SHE WANTS TO RENEGOTIATE  TRADE DEALS.  AFTER 30 YEARS, SHE WANTS TO RENEGOTIATE TRADE DEALS. HER HUSBAND SIGNED NAFTA, THE WORST TRADE DEAL IN THE HISTORY  OF THE WORLD. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO INCREASE SYRIAN MIGRANTS COMING  INTO OUR COUNTRY THAT WE DON'T  KNOW WHO THEY ARE BY 550 PERCENT.  NO WAY. NO WAY. BUT YOU KNOW, I DO LAUGH BECAUSE  SHE IS ON A NEW KICK AND THE NEW KICK IS, YOU KNOW, BAD JUDGMENT, EVERYTHING SHE TOUCHES IS NOT GOOD. LOOK AT LIBYA, THE MIGRATION, SYRIA, THE IRAN DEAL, EVERY SINGLE -- BENGHAZI, LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED THERE. THE 3:00 IN THE MORNING COMMERCIAL, REMEMBER? WHO DO YOU WANT AT THAT PHONE AT  3:00 IN THE MORNING? I DO NOT WANT HER AT THE FOUND. AT THE PHONE -- AT THE PHONE. SHE LIVES LIKE A DOG ABOUT HER E-MAILS. -- SHE LIED LIKE A DOG ABOUT HER E-MAILS.  SHE SHOWED GREAT NEGLIGENCE AND  WHAT HAPPENED. -- IN WHAT HAPPENED.  SHEEP US ALL AT RISK. -- SHE PUT US ALL AT RISK.  HERE IS THE SECRETARY OF STATE  WITH A SERVER SHE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE.  I TELL YOU WHAT I WOULD RATHER DO, HONESTLY. I WOULD RATHER BEAT HER AT THE POLLS. WE HAVE TO BEAT HER. SHE WOULD BE A DISASTER. REMEMBER THIS, JUSTICES OF THE  UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. WHOEVER THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS,  YOU WILL HAVE AT LEAST TWO COUP, PROBABLY THREE -- TWO, PROBABLY THREE, MAYBE FOUR. IF SHE GETS HER APPOINTMENT, WE WILL BE VENEZUELA. ONE THING I HAVE TO SAY, I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT BERNIE  SANDERS. THEY SAY IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT  STORIES AND HISTORY OF POLITICS. THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NO  MATTER WHERE WE GO. I AM THE MESSENGER OF BEING SMART, COMMON SENSE, OF NOT BEING RIPPED OFF BY EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. OF HAVING STRONG VOTERS. WOULD ANYBODY LIKE TO SEE THE  WALL GET BUILT? 100%. 100%. 100% IT GETS BUILT. THESE POLITICIANS COME UP TO ME  AND THEY GO, I DO NOT  UNDERSTAND, YOU CANNOT BUILD THE  WALL, CAN YOU? DO YOU SEE THAT CEILING? WE DO NOT HAVE TO GO MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT. USUALLY, I AM LOOKING AT A CEILING A LOT TALLER. THAT WOULD BE A GOOD SOLID WALL. ANYBODY THAT GETS UP IS NOT GETTING DOWN SO EASILY.  WE WILL BUILD A WALL. THESE POLITICIANS COME UP TO ME AND THEY SAY, YOU REALLY CAN'T BUILD A WALL. I DO NOT KID. WE WILL BUILD A WALL AND I  EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT 2000 YEARS AGO, THE GREAT WALL OF  CHINA WAS BUILT AND IT IS 13,000  MILES LONG. WE NEED 1000 MILES AND WE HAVE CATERPILLAR TRACTORS, RIGHT? HOW EASY IS THIS? WE HAVE A LOT OF NATURAL  BORDERS. WE WILL NEED ABOUT 1000 MILES. THAT WILL GO UP SO FAST, YOUR HEAD WILL SPIN. I WAS ENDORSED BY THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS. FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY,  16,500 BORDER PATROL AGENTS, I WAS ENDORSED BY THE GREAT JOE ARPAIO. NOBODY KNOWS BETTER THAN SHERIFF  JOE. HE ENDORSED ME.  WE HAVE TREMENDOUS ENDORSEMENTS. I SAID TO THE TOP PEOPLE, MR. TRUMP, WE ARE ENDORSING YOU. MR. TRUMP, THEY ARE NOT LETTING  US TO OUR JOB. HOW IMPORTANT IS THE WALL? THEY SAID, THE WALL IS VITAL. IT IS A GREAT TOOL. WE HAVE TO STOP THE DRUGS FROM  COMING IN. WE HAVE TO STOP ILLEGALS FROM POURING ACROSS THE BORDER. YOU KNOW, LET ME TELL YOU, ONE  OF THE INTERESTING THINGS -- THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO WAS BEING  INTERVIEWED AND HE SAID, THE PAST PRESIDENT, AND HE SAID THERE IS NO WAY THEY ARE GOING  TO BUILD -- AND YOU KNOW WHAT  HAPPENED. HE USED THE F BOMB ON LIVE TELEVISION. ON THAT STATION RIGHT THERE. HE USED THE F BOMB.  CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I USED IT? IT WOULD BE OVER. HE SAID, THAT WALL WILL NEVER  EVER GET BUILT.  AND I SAID, THAT IS GREAT NEWS. BEFORE THEY WERE GOING SOME A DIFFERENT LEVELS.  NOW HE SAYS IT WILL NOT BE PAID FOR BY THEM.  WE ARE GOING TO BUILD THE WALL, MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL 100%. 100%. WE WILL STOP THE DRUGS FROM  PULLING INTO OUR COUNTRY AND POISONING OUR YOUTH. WE ARE GOING TO STOP PEOPLE THAT  ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE FROM  COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. PEOPLE LIKE THIS -- PEOPLE LIKE IT.  THIS WAS ACTUALLY A SONG WRITTEN AL WILSON QUITE A WHILE AGO. THIS REALLY PERTAINS TO WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE TALK ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. LET ME DO THIS. I READ IT A COUPLE OF TIMES AND  PEOPLE LOVE IT. IT IS CALLED ""THE SNAKE."" THIS  PERTAINS TO PEOPLE COMING ACROSS THE BORDER AND PEOPLE COMING IN FROM SYRIA. THEY CUT THE HEADS OFF PEOPLE. THEY DROWN PEOPLE IN STEEL CAGES  BY THE THOUSANDS. THEY ARE CUTTING OFF HEADS.  THIS IS LIKE MEDIEVAL TIMES. AND THEN THEY SAY TO ME -- THEY TALK ABOUT WATERBOARDING. I AM OK WITH IT, I AM SORRY. CAN YOU IMAGINE -- WATERBOARDING BECAME FAMOUS. THEY FELT IT WAS JUST SHORT OF TORTURE. I AM NOT SAYING IT IS PLEASANT. BELIEVE ME, IT WORKS. THEY ASKED DURING ONE OF THE DEBATES, THEY ASKED TED CRUZ, AND HE WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. WAS THAT A DISPLAY OF LOVE,  SPEAKING OF TED CRUZ? WHEN THEY BOOED HIM OFF THAT STAGE, SERIOUSLY, THE ENTIRE TEXAS DELEGATION BOOED HIM OFF AT STAGE. SAY WHAT YOU WANT, THEY DID NOT  COVER IT THAT WAY.  THAT IS WHEN YOU KNEW THE PARTY WAS UNITED. OTHER THAN A FEW GUYS -- IT WAS  THE TOUGHEST PRIMARY EVER FOUGHT .  WE HAD 17 PEOPLE. AND WE HAD TRUMP. REMEMBER WHEN I CAME IN AND  THESE AND THEN'S SAID -- AND IT'S -- AN EVENTPUNDIT SAID, HE WILL NEVER RUN.  HE IS JUST HAVING A GOOD TIME. IT IS 120 DEGREES UNDER THOSE CRAZY LIGHTS, IT IS LATE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME I GET HOME TONIGHT? 4:00 IN THE MORNING. WHEN BILL O'REILLY AND OTHERS SAY IT WAS THE SINGLE GREATEST POLITICAL PHENOMENA THAT HE HAS WITNESSED IN HIS LIFETIME, HE HAS SEEN A LOT, THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS. REMEMBER -- AND WE STARTED OFF AT 6%. THESE PUNDITS SAID, HE GOT 6%. 6%, THAT WILL BE HIS CEILING. 6% WILL BE HIS CEILING. THEY SPEAK WITH SUCH SURETY. NEXT WEEK, I GET 12%. HE GOT 12%, A LITTLE HIGHER THAN I THOUGHT. A LITTLE HIGHER THAN I THOUGHT,  THAT WILL BE HIS CEILING.  HE WILL NOT GO HIGHER THAN THAT.  NEXT WE GET 18%. THEN I GET 22%. THEN THEY GET 25%.  27% 30%.  32%. 36%.  THEN I GET 38%.  EVERY SINGLE TIME, THEY SAY THAT  WILL BE THE CEILING. WHEN I'M HITTING 30'S AND  EVERYONE ELSE IS LOW, YOU HAVE  SOME ZEROS. OUT OF MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF  PEOPLE, NOBODY VOTED FOR THEM. GO HOME, GET OUT.  THEY WERE AMONG THE NASTIEST OF PEOPLE.  THERE WERE THE NASTIEST ONES. I HAD 38%. AND THEN I HIT 42.  I WILL NEVER FORGET, ONE OF THE PEOPLE, I HIT 42% AND THERE WERE LIKE 10 PEOPLE LEFT.  THEY SAID, HE HIT 42%, BUT HE  CANNOT BREAK 50.  HE CANNOT BREAK 50%. I GOT 10 PEOPLE. SENATORS, GOVERNORS. BEN CARSON, A GREAT GUY, HE  ENDORSED ME. SMART GUY, GOOD GUY. I GET 42% AND HAVE THESE IDIOTS  SAYING HE MAY HAVE 42%, BUT HE  DOES NOT HAVE 50.  WE HAVE 10 PEOPLE LEFT.  HERE'S THE STORY.  WE GET MORE AND MORE AND DO A  NUMBER AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT,  IT IS A GREAT FEELING.  A LOT OF FEELINGS WERE HURT.  BECAUSE PEOPLE SAY IT WAS THE  NASTIEST, MEANEST, HARDEST  PRIMARY EVER FOUGHT IN THE  HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY.  MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOUGHER BEFORE TELEVISION, BUT HOW COULD IT BE. WHEN YOU CAN SAY SOMETHING ON  TELEVISION, YOU REACH EVERYBODY  AT ONE TIME.  YOU CALL SOMEONE A CERTAIN NAME  AND EVERYONE HEARS IT.  SOME OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE NOT RECOVERED.  BUT SLOWLY BUT SURELY, MARCO  RUBIO, HE ENDORSED ME LAST WEEK.  HE'S A GOOD GUY AND RUNNING FOR SENATE IN FLORIDA AND HE WILL WIN.  AND I WILL WIN IN FLORIDA.  I HAVE TO WIN HERE. NOW I START UP HERE, I GET HERE AND THEY ARE LIKE SAYING, BUT DONALD TRUMP NEVER DID THIS BEFORE. ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WAS RUNNING HAS BEEN OUT OF OFFICE FOR A WHILE AND THEY SAID, HE HAS ONLY BEEN OFFICE FOR EIGHT YEARS. AND THEY DON'T SAY THAT ABOUT TRUMP. I'VE NEVER BEEN IN OFFICE. THEY DON'T GIVE ME A PASS. WE END UP GETTING THIS AND NEVER -- WE END UP GETTING THIS AND  NOW WE ARE DOWN TO THE FINAL STRAW. I GET A CALL FROM A BIG REPORTER.  THE BIGGEST.  HAPPENS TO BE A SLIGHT LIBERAL.  HE SAID HOW DOES IT FEEL?  WHAT YOU HAVE DONE HAS NEVER  BEEN DONE BEFORE.  AND I SAID, I DISAGREE.  IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU  WIN OR LOSE, YOU WILL BE IN THE  HISTORY BOOK FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.  AND I SAID, LET ME STOP YOU  THERE, IF I DON'T WIN, IF I DON'T BEAT CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON, SHE IS AS CROOKED AS A  THREE DOLLAR BILL, IF I DON'T BE CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON, I WILL  CONSIDER THIS A TREMENDOUS WASTE  OF TIME, ENERGY AND MONEY.  BELIEVE ME.  I'M NOT LOOKING TO BE IN THE HISTORY BOOKS UNLESS IT IS AT THE TOP. WE WILL MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT.  WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.  SO I FOUND THIS AND NOT A LOT OF  PEOPLE KNOW IT, BUT I THINK IT  IS TERRIFIC. REMEMBER THIS HAS TO DO WITH  SYRIANS COMING ACROSS.  I HAVE A BIG HEART.  I WANT TO BUILD SAFE ZONES IN SYRIA. I WANT TO GET THE GULF STATES TO PAY FOR IT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING RIGHT NOW. WITHOUT US IT WOULD NOT BE THERE FOR TWO MINUTES AND THEY HAVE NOTHING BUT MONEY. WE OWE $20 TRILLION, I WILL PUT  MY DEVELOPER HAT ON. WE WILL BUILD SAFE ZONES THAT  WILL BE FUNDED BY OTHER COUNTRIES WITH LOTS OF MONEY. AND WE WILL SUPERVISE IT. THINK OF THIS, THIS IS PEOPLE  COMING IN, WE DON'T KNOW WHO  THEY ARE BUT WE DO KNOW THERE  WILL BE TROUBLE.  IT IS ONLY A QUESTION OF WHEN.  ON HER WAY TO WORK ONE MORNING,  DOWN THE PATH ALONG THE LAKE, A  TENDERHEARTED WOMAN SAW A HALF  FROZEN BEAUTIFUL SNAKE.  SHE CRIED, I WILL TAKE YOU IN  AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU.  YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, THIS IS  A SNAKE THAT IS IN BAD SHAPE AND  YOU HAVE THIS NICE WOMAN AND SHE  GOES, A TENDERHEARTED WOMAN SAW  A HALF FROZEN SNAKE.  HIS PRETTY COLORED SKIN HAD BEEN  FROSTED WITH THE DO. -- THE DEW. SHE CRIED, I WILL TAKE YOU IN.  AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU.  TAKE ME IN.  TAKE ME FOR HEAVENS SAKE.  TAKE ME IN.  SHE WRAPPED HIM UP ALL COZY AND","Donald Trump Campaign Rally in Denver, Colorado"
60,2016-07-21,http://www.c-span.org/video/?412402-8/donald-trump-2016-acceptance-speech,[u'donald j. trump'],Trump,"  I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TONIGHT TO PRESENT TO YOU AND TO ALL OF AMERICA MY FATHER AND OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, DONALD J TRUMP.  >> THANK YOU.  THANK YOU MUCH. FRIENDS, DELEGATES AND FELLOW  AMERICANS: I HUMBLY AND  GRATEFULLY ACCEPT YOUR  NOMINATION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF  THE UNITED STATES.  USA! USA! >> USA! USA! >> WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT WHAT WE STARTED THIS JOURNEY ON  JUNE 16, LAST YEAR, WE AND I SAY WE BECAUSE WE ARE A TEAM.  WOULD HAVE RECEIVED ALMOST 14  MILLION VOTES, THE MOST IN THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WOULD GET 60% MORE VOTES THAN IT RECEIVED EIGHT YEARS AGO. WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT?  THE DEMOCRATS ON THE OTHER HAND, RECEIVED 20% FEWER VOTES THAN  THEY GOT FOUR YEARS AGO, NOT SO  GOOD.  TOGETHER, WE WILL LEAD OUR PARTY  BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE, AND WE WILL LEAD OUR COUNTRY  BACK TO SAFETY, PROSPERITY, AND  PEACE.  WE WILL BE A COUNTRY OF  GENEROSITY AND WARMTH. BUT WE WILL ALSO BE A COUNTRY OF  LAW AND ORDER.  OUR CONVENTION OCCURS AT A  MOMENT OF CRISIS FOR OUR NATION.  THE ATTACKS ON OUR POLICE, AND THE TERRORISM IN OUR CITIES,  THREATEN OUR VERY WAY OF LIFE. ANY POLITICIAN WHO DOES NOT  GRASP THIS DANGER IS NOT FIT TO  LEAD OUR COUNTRY.  AMERICANS WATCHING THIS ADDRESS TONIGHT HAVE SEEN THE RECENT  IMAGES OF VIOLENCE IN OUR STREETS AND THE CHAOS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. MANY HAVE WITNESSED THIS VIOLENCE PERSONALLY, SOME HAVE EVEN BEEN ITS VICTIMS. I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR ALL OF YOU: THE CRIME AND VIOLENCE THAT TODAY AFFLICTS OUR NATION WILL SOON, AND I MEAN VERY SOON COME  TO AN END.  BEGINNING ON JANUARY 20TH 2017,  SAFETY WILL BE RESTORED.  THE MOST BASIC DUTY OF  GOVERNMENT IS TO DEFEND THE  LIVES OF ITS CITIZENS. ANY GOVERNMENT THAT FAILS TO DO  SO IS A GOVERNMENT UNWORTHY TO LEAD.  IT IS FINALLY TIME FOR A  STRAIGHTFORWARD ASSESSMENT OF  THE STATE OF OUR NATION.  I WILL PRESENT THE FACTS PLAINLY  AND HONESTLY. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE SO  POLITICALLY CORRECT ANYMORE.  SO IF YOU WANT TO HEAR THE  CORPORATE SPIN, THE CAREFULLY-CRAFTED LIES, AND THE  MEDIA MYTHS, THE DEMOCRATS ARE  HOLDING THEIR CONVENTION NEXT WEEK.  GO THERE. BUT HERE, AT OUR CONVENTION, THERE WILL BE NO LIES. WE WILL HONOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH THE TRUTH, AND NOTHING ELSE.  >> USA. USA. USA. >> THESE ARE THE FACTS: DECADES OF PROGRESS MADE IN BRINGING DOWN CRIME ARE NOW BEING REVERSED BY THIS ADMINISTRATION'S ROLLBACK OF  CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT. HOMICIDES LAST YEAR INCREASED BY 17% IN AMERICA'S FIFTY LARGEST  CITIES. THAT'S THE LARGEST INCREASE IN  25 YEARS. >> BOO! IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL, KILLINGS HAVE RISEN BY 50%. THEY ARE UP NEARLY 60% IN NEARBY BALTIMORE.  IN THE PRESIDENT'S HOMETOWN OF  CHICAGO, MORE THAN 2,000 HAVE  BEEN THE VICTIMS OF SHOOTINGS  THIS YEAR ALONE. AND ALMOST 4000 HAVE BEEN KILLED  IN THE CHICAGO AREA  SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE. >> BOO! >> THE NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY HAS  RISEN BY ALMOST 50% COMPARED TO THIS POINT LAST YEAR. NEARLY 180,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS, ORDERED DEPORTED FROM OUR COUNTRY, ARE TONIGHT ROAMING FREE TO THREATEN PEACEFUL CITIZENS. THE NUMBER OF NEW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT FAMILIES WHO HAVE  CROSSED THE BORDER SO FAR THIS  YEAR ALREADY EXCEEDS THE ENTIRE TOTAL OF 2015.  THEY ARE BEING RELEASED BY THE TENS OF THOUSANDS INTO OUR  COMMUNITIES WITH NO REGARD FOR THE IMPACT ON PUBLIC SAFETY OR RESOURCES. >> BUILD THE WALL! >> ONE SUCH BORDER-CROSSER WAS  RELEASED AND MADE HIS WAY TO  NEBRASKA. THERE, HE ENDED THE LIFE OF AN  INNOCENT YOUNG GIRL NAMED SARAH  ROUTE. -- ROOT. SHE WAS 21 YEARS OLD AND WAS KILLED THE DAY AFTER GRADUATING  FROM COLLEGE WITH A 4.0  GRADE POINT AVERAGE. THE ONE IN HER CLASS. HER KILLER WAS THEN RELEASED A  SECOND TIME, AND HE IS NOW A  FUGITIVE FROM THE LAW.  I'VE MET SARAH'S BEAUTIFUL  FAMILY.  BUT TO THIS ADMINISTRATION, THEIR AMAZING DAUGHTER WAS JUST  ONE MORE AMERICAN LIFE THAT WASN'T WORTH PROTECTING. NO MORE. ONE MORE CHILD TO SACRIFICE ON THE ALTAR OF OPEN BORDERS. WHAT ABOUT OUR ECONOMY? AGAIN, I WILL TELL YOU THE PLAIN FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN EDITED OUT OF YOUR NIGHTLY NEWS AND YOUR MORNING NEWSPAPER: NEARLY FOUR IN 10 AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE LIVING IN POVERTY, WHILE 58% OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH ARE NOW  NOT EMPLOYED. 2 MILLION MORE LATINOS ARE IN  POVERTY TODAY THAN WHEN THE  PRESIDENT TOOK HIS OATH OF  OFFICE EIGHT YEARS AGO. ANOTHER 14 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE  LEFT THE WORKFORCE ENTIRELY.  HOUSEHOLD INCOMES ARE DOWN MORE  THAN $4,000 SINCE THE YEAR 2000. THAT IS 16 YEARS AGO. OUR TRADE DEFICIT IN GOODS REACHED, THINK OF THIS, OUR TRADE DEFICIT IS IT HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS.  THINK OF THAT. $800 BILLION LAST YEAR ALONE. WE WILL FIX THAT.  THE BUDGET IS NO BETTER.  PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DOUBLED OUR -- ALMOST DOUBLED OUR NATIONAL DEBT TO MORE THAN $19 TRILLION, AND GROWING. YET, WHAT DO WE HAVE TO SHOW FOR IT?  OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES ARE FALLING APART, OUR AIRPORTS ARE  IN THIRD WORLD CONDITION, AND 43 MILLION AMERICANS ARE ON FOOD STAMPS.  NOW LET US CONSIDER THE STATE OF AFFAIRS ABROAD.  NOT ONLY HAVE OUR CITIZENS ENDURED DOMESTIC DISASTER, BUT THEY HAVE LIVED THROUGH ONE  INTERNATIONAL HUMILIATION AFTER  ANOTHER. ONE AFTER ANOTHER. WE ALL REMEMBER THE IMAGES OF  OUR SAILORS BEING FORCED TO  THEIR KNEES BY THEIR IRANIAN CAPTORS AT GUNPOINT. >> BOO! >> THIS WAS JUST PRIOR TO THE  SIGNING OF THE IRAN DEAL, WHICH  GAVE BACK TO IRAN $150 BILLION  AND GAVE US ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. >> BOO! >> IT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS  ONE OF THE WORST DEALS EVER  NEGOTIATED. ANOTHER HUMILIATION CAME WHEN  PRESIDENT OBAMA DREW A RED LINE IN SYRIA AND THE WHOLE WORLD KNEW IT MEANT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. IN LIBYA, OUR CONSULATE, THE  SYMBOL OF AMERICAN PRESTIGE AROUND THE GLOBE WAS BROUGHT  DOWN IN FLAMES. AMERICA IS FAR LESS SAFE AND  THE WORLD IS FAR LESS STABLE  THAN WHEN OBAMA MADE THE  DECISION TO PUT HILLARY CLINTON  IN CHARGE OF AMERICA'S FOREIGN  POLICY. >> BOO! >>LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! >> LED TO DEFEAT HER IN NOVEMBER.  I AM CERTAIN IT IS A DECISION HE  TRULY REGRETS.  HER BAD INSTINCTS AND HER BAD JUDGMENT, SOMETHING POINTED OUT BY BERNIE SANDERS ARE WHAT CAUSED THE DISASTERS UNFOLDING  TODAY. LET'S REVIEW THE RECORD. IN 2009, PRE-HILLARY, ISIS WAS  NOT EVEN ON THE MAP. LIBYA WAS STABLE. EACH OF WAS PEACEFUL. IRAQ WAS SEEN A BIG PRODUCTION AND VIOLENCE.  IRAN WAS BEING CHOKED BY  SANCTIONS. SERIAL WAS SOMEWHAT UNDER  CONTROL. AFTER FOUR YEARS OF HILLARY  CLINTON, WHAT DO WE HAVE?  ISIS HAS SPREAD ACROSS THE REGION AND THE ENTIRE WORLD. LIBYA IS IN RUINS, AND OUR AMBASSADOR AND HIS STAFF WERE  LEFT HELPLESS TO DIE AT THE HANDS OF SAVAGE KILLERS. EGYPT WAS TURNED OVER TO THE RADICAL MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD,  FORCING THE MILITARY TO RETAKE CONTROL. IRAQ IS IN CHAOS. IRAN IS ON THE PATH TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS. SYRIA IS ENGULFED IN A CIVIL WAR AND A REFUGEE CRISIS THAT NOW THREATENS THE WEST. AFTER 15 YEARS OF WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AFTER TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT AND THOUSANDS OF  LIVES LOST, THE SITUATION IS  WORSE THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN BEFORE. THIS IS THE LEGACY OF HILLARY CLINTON: DEATH, DESTRUCTION AND TERRORISM AND WEAKNESS. >> BOO! >> BUT HILLARY CLINTON'S LEGACY  DOES NOT HAVE TO BE AMERICA'S LEGACY.  THE PROBLEMS WE FACE NOW,  POVERTY AND VIOLENCE AT HOME, WAR AND DESTRUCTION ABROAD, WILL  LAST ONLY AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE  RELYING ON THE SAME POLITICIANS  WHO CREATED THEM.  A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP IS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE A CHANGE IN OUTCOMES.  TONIGHT, I WILL SHARE WITH YOU FOR ACTION FOR AMERICA.  THE MOST IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN OUR PLAN AND THAT OF OUR  OPPONENTS, IS THAT OUR PLAN WILL PUT AMERICA FIRST.  AMERICANISM, NOT GLOBALISM, WILL  BE OUR CREDO.  AS LONG AS WE ARE LED BY POLITICIANS WHO WILL NOT PUT AMERICA FIRST, THEN WE CAN BE ASSURED THAT OTHER NATIONS WILL  NOT TREAT AMERICA WITH RESPECT.  THE RESPECT THAT WE DESERVE.  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL COME  ONCE AGAIN. FIRST MY PLAN WILL BEGIN WITH SAFETY AT HOME WHICH MEANS SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS, SECURE BORDERS,  AND PROTECTION FROM TERRORISM. THERE CAN BE NO PROSPERITY WITHOUT LAW AND ORDER.  ON THE ECONOMY, I WILL OUTLINE REFORMS TO ADD MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS AND TRILLIONS IN NEW WEALTH THAT CAN BE USED TO REBUILD AMERICA. A NUMBER OF THESE REFORMS THAT I WILL OUTLINE TONIGHT WILL BE OPPOSED BY SOME OF OUR NATION'S  MOST POWERFUL SPECIAL INTERESTS.  THAT IS BECAUSE THESE INTERESTS  HAVE RIGGED OUR POLITICAL AND  ECONOMIC SYSTEM FOR THEIR  EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT. BELIEVE ME. IT IS FURTHER BENEFIT. -- FOUR THEIR BENEFIT. BIG BUSINESS, ELITE MEDIA AND  MAJOR DONORS ARE LINING UP  BEHIND THE CAMPAIGN OF MY  OPPONENT BECAUSE THEY KNOW SHE  WILL KEEP OUR RIGGED SYSTEM IN  PLACE. THEY ARE THROWING MONEY AT HER  BECAUSE THEY HAVE TOTAL CONTROL  OVER EVERY SINGLE THING SHE  DOES.  SHE IS THEIR PUPPET, AND THEY PULL THE STRINGS. THAT IS WHY HILLARY CLINTON'S  MESSAGE IS THAT THINGS WILL  NEVER CHANGE. NEVER EVER. MY MESSAGE IS THAT THINGS HAVE TO CHANGE AND THEY HAVE TO CHANGE RIGHT NOW.  EVERY DAY I WAKE UP DETERMINED  TO DELIVER A BETTER LIFE FOR THE  PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS NATION THAT HAD BEEN IGNORED, NEGLECTED  AND ABANDONED. , I HAVE VISITED THE LAID-OFF  FACTORY WORKERS, AND THE  COMMUNITIES CRUSHED BY OUR  HORRIBLE AND UNFAIR TRADE DEALS. THESE ARE THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND  WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY, AND THEY  ARE FORGOTTEN, BUT THEY WILL NOT  BE FORGOTTEN LONG.  THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD  BUT NO LONGER HAVE A VOICE.  I AM YOUR VOICE.  I HAVE EMBRACED CRYING MOTHERS  WHO HAVE LOST THEIR CHILDREN  BECAUSE OUR POLITICIANS PUT  THEIR PERSONAL AGENDAS BEFORE  THE NATIONAL GOOD. I HAVE NO PATIENCE FOR -- >> USA. USA. USA. USA. >> HOW GREAT OUR OUR POLICE AND  HOW GREAT IS CLEVELAND?  THANK YOU. I HAVE NO PATIENCE FOR  INJUSTICE. NO TOLERANCE FOR GOVERNMENT INCOMPETENCE OF WHICH THERE IS  SO MUCH NO SYMPATHY FOR LEADERS , WHO FEEL THEIR CITIZENS.  WHEN INNOCENT PEOPLE SUFFER,  BECAUSE OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM  LACKS THE WILL, OR THE COURAGE,  OR THE BASIC DECENCY TO ENFORCE OUR LAWS, OR WORSE STILL, HAS  SOLD OUT TO SOME CORPORATE LOBBYIST FOR CASH I AM NOT ABLE , TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY. AND I WON'T LOOK THE OTHER WAY.  AND WHEN A SECRETARY OF STATE  ILLEGALLY STORES HER EMAILS ON A  PRIVATE SERVER, DELETES 33,000  OF THEM SO THE AUTHORITIES CAN'T  SEE HER CRIME, PUTS OUR COUNTRY  AT RISK, LIES ABOUT IT IN EVERY  DIFFERENT FORM AND FACES NO NO CONSEQUENCE I KNOW THAT , CORRUPTION HAS REACHED A LEVEL LIKE NEVER EVER BEFORE IN OUR  COUNTRY.  WHEN THE FBI DIRECTOR SAYS THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE WAS ""EXTREMELY CARELESS"" AND ""NEGLIGENT,"" IN HANDLING OUR CLASSIFIED SECRETS, I ALSO KNOW THAT THESE TERMS ARE MINOR COMPARED TO WHAT SHE ACTUALLY DID.  THEY WERE JUST USED TO SAVE HER FROM FACING JUSTICE FOR HER TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE CRIMES. IN FACT, HER SINGLE GREATEST  ACCOMPLISHMENT MAY BE COMMITTING  SUCH AN EGREGIOUS CRIME AND  GETTING AWAY WITH IT, ESPECIALLY  WHEN OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN FAR LESS HAVE PAID SO DEARLY. WHEN THAT SAME SECRETARY OF  STATE RAKES IN MILLIONS OF  DOLLARS TRADING ACCESS AND  FAVORS TO SPECIAL INTERESTS AND  FOREIGN POWERS I KNOW THE TIME  FOR ACTION HAS COME.  I HAVE JOINED THE POLITICAL  ARENA SO THAT THE POWERFUL CAN  NO LONGER BEAT UP ON PEOPLE THAT  CANNOT DEFEND THEMSELVES.  NOBODY KNOWS THE SYSTEM BETTER  THAN ME, WHICH IS WHY I ALONE  CAN FIX IT.  I HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND HOW THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED AGAINST OUR CITIZENS, JUST LIKE IT WAS RIGGED AGAINST BERNIE SANDERS.  HE NEVER HAD A CHANCE. BUT HIS  -- >> BOO! >> BUT HIS SUPPORTERS WILL JOIN OUR MOVEMENT, BECAUSE WE WILL FIX HIS BIGGEST ISSUE. TRADE DEALS THAT STRIP OUR  COUNTRY OF JOBS AND THE  DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH IN THE  COUNTRY. MILLIONS OF DEMOCRATS WILL JOIN  OUR MOVEMENT, BECAUSE WE ARE  GOING TO FIX THE SYSTEM SO IT  WORKS FAIRLY AND JUSTLY FOR EACH  AND EVERY AMERICAN.  IN THIS CAUSE, I AM PROUD TO  HAVE AT MY SIDE THE NEXT VICE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE OF INDIANA.  AND A GREAT GUIDE. -- GUY. WE WILL BRING THE SAME ECONOMIC  SUCCESS TO AMERICA THAT MIKE BROUGHT INDIANA, WHICH IS  AMAZING.  HE IS A MAN OF CHARACTER AND ACCOMPLISHMENT.  HE IS THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB. THE FIRST TASK FOR OUR NEW ADMINISTRATION WILL BE TO LIBERATE OUR CITIZENS FROM THE  CRIME AND TERRORISM AND LAWLESSNESS THAT THREATENS THEIR -- OUR COMMUNITIES.  AMERICA WAS SHOCKED TO ITS CORE WHEN OUR POLICE OFFICERS IN DALLAS WERE SO BRUTALLY EXECUTED .  A MEDIATELY AFTER DALLAS, WE HAVE SEEN CONTINUED THREATS AND VIOLENCE AGAINST OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.  LAW OFFICERS HAVE BEEN SHOT OR KILLED IN RECENT DAYS IN  GEORGIA, MISSOURI, WISCONSIN,  KANSAS, MICHIGAN AND TENNESSEE.  >> BOO! >> ON SUNDAY, MORE POLICE WERE  GUNNED DOWN IN BATON ROUGE,  LOUISIANA. THREE WERE KILLED, AND FOUR WERE -- THREE WERE VERY BADLY  INJURED. AN ATTACK ON LAW ENFORCEMENT IS  AN ATTACK ON ALL AMERICANS.  I HAVE A MESSAGE TO EVERY LAST  PERSON THREATENING THE PEACE ON  OUR STREETS AND THE SAFETY OF  OUR POLICE: WHEN I TAKE THE OATH  OF OFFICE NEXT YEAR, I WILL  RESTORE LAW AND ORDER TO OUR COUNTRY.  I WILL WORK WITH, AND APPOINT,  THE BEST PROSECUTORS AND LAW  ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IN THE  COUNTRY TO GET THE JOB PROPERLY  DONE.  IN THIS RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE, I AM THE LAW AND ORDER CANDIDATE.  THE IRRESPONSIBLE RHETORIC OF OUR PRESIDENT, WHO HAS USED THE PULPIT OF THE PRESIDENCY TO DIVIDE US BY RACE AND COLOR, HAS  MADE AMERICA A MORE DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT THAN FRANKLY, I HAVE  EVER SEEN AND ANYBODY IN THIS  ROOM HAS EVER WATCHED OR SEEING. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS FAILED  AMERICA'S INNER CITIES. REMEMBER, IT HAS FAILED  AMERICA'S INNER CITIES. IT'S FAILED THEM ON EDUCATION. IT'S FAILED THEM ON JOBS. IT'S FAILED THEM ON CRIME. IT'S FAILED THEM IN EVERY WAY  AND ON EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, I WILL WORK TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR KIDS  ARE TREATED EQUALLY, AND  PROTECTED EQUALLY. EVERY ACTION I TAKE, I WILL ASK MYSELF: DOES THIS MAKE LIFE  BETTER FOR YOUNG AMERICANS IN  BALTIMORE, CHICAGO, DETROIT, AND FERGUSON WHO HAVE REALLY  COME IN EVERY WAY, HAVE THE SAME RIGHT TO LIVE OUT THEIR DREAMS  AS ANY OTHER CHILD IN AMERICA?  TO MAKE LIFE SAFE IN AMERICA, WE  MUST ALSO ADDRESS THE GROWING THREATS FROM OUTSIDE THE  COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO DEFEAT THE  BARBARIANS OF ISIS.  AND WE ARE GOING TO DEFEAT THEM  BAD.  ONCE AGAIN, FRANCE IS THE VICTIM  OF BRUTAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN VICIOUSLY MOWED DOWN. LIVES RUINED. FAMILIES RIPPED APART. A NATION IN MOURNING. THE DAMAGE AND DEVASTATION THAT CAN BE INFLICTED BY ISLAMIC RADICALS HAS BEEN PROVEN OVER AND OVER. AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, AT AN OFFICE PARTY IN SAN BERNARDINO, AT THE BOSTON MARATHON, AND A  MILITARY RECRUITING CENTER IN  CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE. AND MANY OTHER LOCATIONS. ONLY WEEKS AGO, IN ORLANDO,  FLORIDA, 49 WONDERFUL AMERICANS  WERE SAVAGELY MURDERED BY AN  ISLAMIC TERRORIST. THIS TIME, THE TERRORIST TARGETED LGBTQ COMMUNITY. NO GOOD. AND WE'RE GOING TO STOP IT.  AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL DO  EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO  PROTECT OUR LGBTQ CITIZENS FROM  THE VIOLENCE AND OPPRESSION OF A HATEFUL FOREIGN IDEOLOGY.  BELIEVE ME. AND I HAVE TO SAY AS A  REPUBLICAN, IT IS SO NICE TO  HEAR YOU CHEERING FOR WHAT I  JUST SAID. THANK YOU.  TO PROTECT US FROM TERRORISM, WE  NEED TO FOCUS ON THREE THINGS. WE MUST HAVE THE BEST , ABSOLUTELY THE BEST GATHERING OF INTELLIGENCE ANYWHERE IN THE  WORLD.  THE BEST.  WE MUST ABANDON THE FAILED  POLICY OF NATION- BUILDING AND  REGIME CHANGE THAT HILLARY  CLINTON PUSHED IN IRAQ, LIBYA, IN EGYPT, AND SYRIA. INSTEAD, WE MUST WORK WITH ALL  OF OUR ALLIES WHO SHARE OUR GOAL  OF DESTROYING ISIS AND STAMPING OUT ISLAMIC TERRORISM AND DOING IT NOW, DOING IT QUICKLY. WE'RE GOING TO WIN.  WE'RE GOING TO WIN FAST.  THIS INCLUDES WORKING WITH OUR GREATEST ALLY IN THE REGION, THE STATE OF ISRAEL.  RECENTLY I HAVE SAID THAT NATO  WAS OBSOLETE. BECAUSE IT DID NOT PROPERLY COVER TERROR. AND ALSO THAT MANY OF THE MEMBER COUNTRIES WERE NOT PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. >> BOO! >> AS USUAL, THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN PICKING UP THE COST. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT NATO WILL BE SETTING UP A NEW PROGRAM IN ORDER TO COMBAT TERRORISM. A TRUE STEP IN THE RIGHT  TRACTION. -- DIRECTION.  LASTLY, AND VERY IMPORTANTLY, WE  MUST IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND IMMIGRATION FROM ANY NATION THAT  HAS BEEN COMPROMISED BY  TERRORISM UNTIL SUCH TIME AS  PROVEN VETTING MECHANISMS HAVE  BEEN PUT IN PLACE.  WE DON'T WANT THEM IN OUR  COUNTRY.  MY OPPONENT HAS CALLED FOR A RADICAL 550% INCREASE, THINK OF THIS, THIS IS NOT BELIEVABLE,  BUT THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING, A 550% INCREASE IN SYRIAN REFUGEES ON TOP OF EXISTING MASSIVE  REFUGEE FLOWS COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY ALREADY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT OBAMA. >> BOO! >> SHE PROPOSES THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO WAY TO  SCREEN THESE REFUGEES IN ORDER  TO FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE OR  WHERE THEY COME FROM. I ONLY WANT TO ADMIT INDIVIDUALS  INTO OUR COUNTRY WHO WILL  SUPPORT OUR VALUES AND LOVE OUR  PEOPLE.  ANYONE WHO ENDORSES VIOLENCE,  HATRED OR OPPRESSION IS NOT  WELCOME IN OUR COUNTRY AND NEVER  EVER WILL BE.  DECADES OF RECORD IMMIGRATION  HAVE PRODUCED LOWER WAGES AND  HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT FOR OUR  CITIZENS, ESPECIALLY FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO  WORKERS.  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT WORKS,  BUT ONE THAT WORKS FOR THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE.  ON MONDAY, WE HEARD FROM THREE  PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN WERE  KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS MARY ANN MENDOZA, SABINE DURDEN,  AND MY FRIEND JAMIEL SHAW. THEY ARE JUST THREE BRAVE REPRESENTATIVES OF MANY THOUSANDS WHO HAVE SUFFERED SO  GREATLY. OF ALL MY TRAVELS IN THIS COUNTRY, NOTHING HAS AFFECTED ME  MORE, NOTHING EVEN CLOSE THAN  THE TIME I HAVE SPENT WITH THE MOTHERS AND FATHERS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR CHILDREN TO VIOLENCE SPILLING ACROSS OUR BORDERS,  WHICH WE CAN SOLVE. WE HAVE TO SOLVE IT.  THESE FAMILIES HAVE NO SPECIAL  INTERESTS TO REPRESENT THEM.  THERE ARE NO DEMONSTRATORS TO PROTECT THEM AND NONE TOO  PROTEST ON THEIR BEHALF.  MY OPPONENT WILL NEVER MEET WITH  THEM, OR SHARE IN THEIR PAIN. BELIEVE ME. INSTEAD, MY OPPONENT WANTS THINGS WERE CITIES. >> BOO! BUT WHERE WAS SANCTUARY FOR KATE STEINLE? WHERE WAS SANCTUARY FOR THE  CHILDREN OF MARY ANN, SABINE AND JAMIEL? >>IS SO SAD TO EVEN BE TALKING  ABOUT THIS.  WE CAN SOLVE IT SO QUICKLY. WHERE WAS SANCTUARY FOR ALL THE  OTHER AMERICANS WHO HAVE BEEN SO  BRUTALLY MURDERED, AND WHO HAVE  SUFFERED SO HORRIBLY?  THESE WOUNDED AMERICAN FAMILIES  HAVE BEEN ALONE. BUT THEY ARE NOT ALONE ANY  LONGER.  TONIGHT, THIS CANDIDATE AND THIS  WHOLE NATION STAND IN THEIR  CORNER TO SUPPORT THEM, TO SEND  THEM OUR LOVE, AND TO PLEDGE IN  THEIR HONOR THAT WE WILL SAVE COUNTLESS MORE FAMILIES FROM SUFFERING THE SAME AWFUL DATE.  -- FATE.  WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A GREAT BORDER WALL TO STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, TO STOP THE GANGS AND THE VIOLENCE, AND TO STOP THE DRUGS FROM POURING INTO OUR COMMUNITIES.  I HAVE BEEN HONORED TO RECEIVE  THE ENDORSEMENT OF AMERICA'S  BORDER PATROL AGENTS, AND WILL  WORK DIRECTLY WITH THEM TO  PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR LAWFUL, LAWFUL, IMMIGRATION  SYSTEM. BY ENDING CATCH-AND-RELEASE ON  THE BORDER, WE WILL STOP THE  CYCLE OF HUMAN SMUGGLING AND  VIOLENCE. ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS WILL GO DOWN. WE WILL STOP IT. IT WILL NOT BE HAPPENING VERY MUCH ANYMORE.  BELIEVE ME.  PEACE WILL BE RESTORED BY  ENFORCING THE RULES FOR THE  MILLIONS WHO OVERSTAY THEIR  VISAS, OUR LAWS WILL FINALLY RECEIVE THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE.  TONIGHT, I WANT EVERY AMERICAN WHOSE DEMANDS FOR IMMIGRATION SECURITY HAVE BEEN DENIED AND  EVERY POLITICIAN WHO HAS DENIED THEM TO LISTEN VERY CLOSELY TO THE WORDS I AM ABOUT TO SAY. ON ON JANUARY 20 OF 2017, THE DAY I  TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE,  AMERICANS WILL FINALLY WAKE UP  IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE LAWS OF  THE UNITED STATES ARE ENFORCED.  WE ARE GOING TO BE CONSIDERATE  AND COMPASSIONATE TO EVERYONE. BUT MY GREATEST COMPASSION WILL BE FOR OUR OWN STRUGGLING  CITIZENS.  >> USA. USA. USA. >> USA. USA. USA. MY PLAN IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF  THE RADICAL AND DANGEROUS IMMIGRATION POLICY OF HILLARY  CLINTON. AMERICANS WANT RELIEF FROM  UNCONTROLLED IMMIGRATION. WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE NOW. COMMUNITIES WANT RELIEF. YET HILLARY CLINTON IS PROPOSING MASS AMNESTY, MASS IMMIGRATION, AND MASS LAWLESSNESS. >> BOO! >> HER PLAN WILL OVERWHELM YOUR SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS, FURTHER REDUCE YOUR JOBS AND WAGES, AND MAKE IT HARDER FOR RECENT IMMIGRANTS TO ESCAPE FROM THE TREMENDOUS CYCLE OF POVERTY  THEY ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW  AND MAKE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE  FOR THEM TO JOIN THE MIDDLE  CLASS.  I HAVE A DIFFERENT VISION FOR  OUR WORKERS. IT BEGINS WITH A NEW, FAIR TRADE POLICY THAT PROTECTS OUR JOBS  AND STANDS UP TO COUNTRIES THAT CHEAT.  OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY. IT'S BEEN A SIGNATURE MESSAGE OF  MY CAMPAIGN FROM DAY ONE, AND IT  WILL BE A SIGNATURE FEATURE OF  MY PRESIDENCY FROM THE MOMENT I  TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE.  I HAVE MADE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS  IN BUSINESS MAKING DEALS.  NOW I'M GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY RICH AGAIN. USING THE GREATEST BUSINESS PEOPLE OF THE WORLD, I'M GOING TO TURN OUR BAD TRADE AGREEMENTS INTO GREAT TRADE AGREEMENTS. AMERICA HAS LOST NEARLY-ONE THIRD OF ITS MANUFACTURING JOBS  SINCE 1997, FOLLOWING THE  ENACTMENT OF DISASTROUS TRADE  DEALS SUPPORTED BY BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON. REMEMBER, IT WAS BILL CLINTON WHO SIGNED NAFTA, ONE OF THE  WORST ECONOMIC DEALS EVER MADE  BY OUR COUNTRY. OR FRANKLY, ANY OTHER COUNTRY. NEVER EVER AGAIN.  I AM GOING TO BRING OUR JOBS BACK OUR JOBS TO OHIO AND  PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW YORK AND  MICHIGAN AND ALL OF AMERICA AND I AM NOT GOING TO LET COMPANIES  MOVE TO OTHER COUNTRIES, FIRING  THEIR EMPLOYEES ALONG THE WAY,  WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES.  NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE.  MY OPPONENT, ON THE OTHER HAND,  HAS SUPPORTED VIRTUALLY EVERY  TRADE AGREEMENT THAT HAS BEEN  DESTROYING OUR MIDDLE CLASS. SHE  SUPPORTED NAFTA, AND SHE  SUPPORTED CHINA'S ENTRANCE INTO  THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION. ANOTHER ONE OF HER HUSBAND'S COLOSSAL MISTAKES AND DISASTERS. SHE SUPPORTED THE JOB KILLING  TRADE DEAL WITH SOUTH KOREA. SHE SHE SUPPORTED THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP WHICH WILL NOT ONLY  DESTROY OUR MANUFACTURING BUT IT , WILL MAKE AMERICA SUBJECT  TO THE RULINGS OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.  AND IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.  I PLEDGE TO NEVER SIGN ANY TRADE  AGREEMENT THAT HURTS OUR  WORKERS, OR THAT DIMINISHES OUR  FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE.  WE WILL NEVER EVER SIGNED BAD TRADE DEALS. AMERICA FIRST AGAIN. AMERICAN FIRST. INSTEAD, I WILL MAKE INDIVIDUAL DEALS WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES. NO LONGER WILL WE ENTER INTO THESE MASSIVE TRANSACTIONS WITH MANY COUNTRIES THAT ARE  THOUSANDS OF PAGES LONG AND WHICH NO ONE FROM OUR COUNTRY EVEN READS OR UNDERSTANDS. WE ARE GOING TO ENFORCE ALL TRADE VIOLATIONS AGAINST ANY COUNTRY THAT CHEATS.  THIS INCLUDES STOPPING CHINA'S OUTRAGEOUS THEFT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, ALONG WITH THEIR ILLEGAL PRODUCT DUMPING, AND THEIR DEVASTATING CURRENCY MANIPULATION. THEY ARE THE GREATEST THAT EVER  CAME ABOUT, THEY ARE THE GREATEST CURRENTLY MANIPULATORS  EVER. >> BOO! OUR HORRIBLE TRADE AGREEMENTS  WITH CHINA AND MANY OTHERS, WILL  BE TOTALLY RENEGOTIATED. THAT THAT INCLUDES RENEGOTIATING  NAFTA NAFTA TO GET A MUCH BETTER DEAL FOR AMERICA AND WILL WALK AWAY IF WE DON'T GET THAT KIND  OF A DEAL.  OUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO START BUILDING AND MAKING THINGS AGAIN.  NEXT COMES THE REFORM OF OUR TAX  LAWS, REGULATIONS AND ENERGY RULES.  WHILE HILLARY CLINTON PLANS A MASSIVE, AND I MEAN MASSIVE TAX INCREASE, I HAVE PROPOSED THE LARGEST TAX REDUCTION OF ANY CANDIDATE WHO HAS RUN FOR PRESIDENT THIS YEAR, DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN.  MIDDLE-INCOME AMERICANS WILL EXPERIENCE  PROFOUND RELIEF, AND TAXES WILL  BE GREATLY SIMPLIFIED FOR EVERYONE. I MEAN EVERYONE.  AMERICA IS ONE OF THE  HIGHEST-TAXED NATIONS IN THE  WORLD. REDUCING TAXES WILL CAUSE NEW  COMPANIES AND NEW JOBS TO COME ROARING BACK INTO OUR COUNTRY. BELIEVE ME.  IT WILL HAPPEN AND IT WILL  HAPPEN FAST.  THEN WE ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH  THE ISSUE OF REGULATION, ONE OF  THE GREATEST JOB KILLERS OF THEM  ALL. EXCESSIVE REGULATION IS COSTING OUR COUNTRY AS MUCH AS $2 TRILLION A YEAR, AND WE WILL END AND IT VERY QUICKLY.  WE ARE GOING TO LIFT THE  RESTRICTIONS ON THE  PRODUCTION OF AMERICAN ENERGY.  THIS WILL PRODUCE MORE THAN $20 TRILLION IN JOB- CREATING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY OVER THE NEXT  FOUR DECADES. MY OPPONENT, ON THE OTHER HAND,  WANTS TO PUT THE GREAT MINERS  AND STEEL WORKERS OF OUR COUNTRY  OUT OF WORK AND OUT OF BUSINESS. THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN WITH DONALD J TRUMP AS PRESIDENT. OUR STEEL WORKERS AND OUR  STEELWORKERS AND ARE MINERS ARE  GOING BACK TO WORK AGAIN.  WITH THESE NEW ECONOMIC  POLICIES, TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS  WILL START FLOWING INTO OUR  COUNTRY. THIS NEW WEALTH WILL IMPROVE THE  QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL  AMERICANS. WE WILL BUILD THE ROADS, HIGHWAYS, BRIDGES, TUNNELS,  AIRPORTS, AND THE RAILWAYS OF  OUR. -- TOMORROW. THIS, IN TURN, WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF MORE JOBS. WE WILL RESCUE KIDS FROM FAILING SCHOOLS BY HELPING THEIR PARENTS SEND THEM TO A SAFE SCHOOL OF THEIR CHOICE.  MY OPPONENT WOULD RATHER PROTECT EDUCATION BUREAUCRATS THAN SERVE  AMERICAN CHILDREN. THAT IS WHAT SHE IS DOING AND  THAT IS WHAT SHE HAS DONE. WE WILL REPEAL AND REPLACE DISASTROUS OBAMACARE.  YOU WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE YOUR  OWN DOCTOR AGAIN.  AND WE WILL FIX TSA AT THE  AIRPORTS, WHICH IS A TOTAL  DISASTER.  THANK YOU. WE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH ALL OF  OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE DROWNING IN DEBT TO TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE JUST STARTING OUT IN THEIR ADULT LIVES.  TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS. WE WILL COMPLETELY REBUILD OUR DEPLETED MILITARY.  AND THE COUNTRIES THAT WE PROTECTING AT A MASSIVE COST TO US WILL BE ASKED TO PAY THEIR  FAIR SHARE.  WE WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR GREAT  VETERANS LIKE THEY HAVE NEVER  BEEN TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE.  MY JUST-RELEASED 10 POINT PLAN  HAS RELEASED -- RECEIVED  TREMENDOUS BETTER SUPPORT.  WE WILL GUARANTEE THOSE WHO  SERVE THIS COUNTRY WILL BE ABLE TO VISIT THE DOCTOR OR HOSPITAL  OF THEIR CHOICE WITHOUT WAITING FIVE DAYS IN A LINE AND DYING.  MY OPPONENT DISMISSED THE VA  SCANDAL, ONE MORE SIGN OF HOW  OUT OF TOUCH SHE REALLY IS, WE ARE GOING TO ASK EVERY DEPARTMENT HEAD AND GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE A LIST OF WASTEFUL SPENDING PROJECTS THAT WE CAN  ELIMINATE IN MY FIRST 100 DAYS.   THE POLITICIANS HAVE TALKED  ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS, BUT I'M  GOING TO DO IT.  >> YES YOU WILL! YES YOU WILL! YES YOU WILL! >> WE ARE ALSO GOING TO APPOINT JUSTICES TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WHO WILL UPHOLD OUR LAWS AND OUR CONSTITUTION.  THE REPLACEMENT OF OUR BELOVED  JUSTICE SCALIA WILL BE A PERSON OF SIMILAR VIEWS, PRINCIPLES AND  JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHIES. VERY IMPORTANT.  THIS WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST  IMPORTANT ISSUES DECIDED BY THIS  ELECTION. MY OPPONENT WANTS TO ESSENTIALLY ABOLISH THE SECOND AMENDMENT. >> BOO! >> I, ON THE OTHER HAND,  RECEIVED THE EARLY AND STRONG  ENDORSEMENT OF THE NATIONAL  RIFLE ASSOCIATION.  AND WILL PROTECT THE RIGHT OF  ALL AMERICANS TO KEEP THEIR  FAMILIES SAFE.  AT THIS MOMENT, I WOULD LIKE TO  THANK THE EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY  BECAUSE, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT,  THE SUPPORT THEY HAVE GIVEN ME,  AND I'M NOT SURE I TOTALLY DESERVE IT, HAS BEEN SO AMAZING. AND HAS HAD SUCH A BIG AND -- HAS BEEN SUCH A BIG REASON I'M  HERE TONIGHT.  SARTRE. THEY HAVE MUCH TO CONTRIBUTE TO  OUR POLICIES. YET OUR LAWS PREVENT YOU FROM  SPEAKING YOUR MIND FROM YOUR OWN  PULPITS.  AN AMENDMENT, PUSHED BY LYNDON JOHNSON, MANY YEARS AGO,  THREATENS RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS  WITH A LOSS OF THEIR TAX-EXEMPT  STATUS IF THEY OPENLY ADVOCATE  THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS.  THEIR VOICE HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY. I WILL WORK HARD TO REPEAL THAT LANGUAGE AND TO PROTECT FREE SPEECH FOR ALL AMERICANS.  WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THESE GREAT  THINGS AND SO MUCH MORE.  ALL WE NEED TO DO IS START BELIEVING IN OURSELVES AND IN  OUR COUNTRY AGAIN. START BELIEVING.  IT IS TIME TO SHOW THE WHOLE WORLD THAT AMERICA IS BACK, BIGGER AND BETTER AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE.  IN THIS JOURNEY, I'M SO LUCKY TO HAVE AT MY SIDE MY WIFE MELANIA AND MY WONDERFUL CHILDREN DON, IVANKA, ERIC, TIFFANY, AND BARRON: YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MY GREATEST SOURCE OF PRIDE AND JOY.  AND BY THE WAY, MELANIA AND IVANKA, DID THEY DO A JOB?  MY DAD, FRED TRUMP, WAS THE  SMARTEST AND HARDEST WORKING MAN  I EVER KNEW. I WONDER SOMETIMES  WHAT HE'D SAY IF HE WERE HERE TO  SEE THIS TONIGHT. IT'S BECAUSE OF HIM THAT I  LEARNED, FROM MY YOUNGEST AGE,  TO RESPECT THE DIGNITY OF WORK  AND THE DIGNITY OF WORKING  PEOPLE.  HE WAS A  GUY MOST COMFORTABLE IN THE  COMPANY OF BRICKLAYERS, CARPENTERS, AND ELECTRICIANS AND  I HAVE A LOT OF THAT IN ME ALSO. I LOVE THOSE PEOPLE.  THEN THERE'S MY MOTHER, MARY. SHE WAS STRONG, BUT ALSO WARM AND FAIR-MINDED.  SHE WAS A TRULY GREAT MOTHER. SHE WAS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST  HONEST AND CHARITABLE PEOPLE I HAVE EVER KNOWN, AND A GREAT , GREAT JUDGE OF CHARACTER. SHE COULD PICK THEM OUT FROM  ANYWHERE.  TO MY SISTERS, MARY ANNE AND ELIZABETH, MY BROTHER ROBERT AND  MY LATE BROTHER FRED, I WILL  ALWAYS GIVE YOU MY LOVE.  YOU ARE MOST SPECIAL TO  ME.  I HAVE LOVED MY LIFE IN  BUSINESS. BUT NOW, MY SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE  MISSION IS TO GO TO WORK FOR OUR COUNTRY, TO GO TO WORK FOR YOU. IT IS TIME TO DELIVER A VICTORY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE, BUT WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN.  BUT TO DO THAT, WE MUST BREAK  FREE FROM THE PETTY POLITICS OF  THE PAST. AMERICA IS A NATION OF BELIEVERS, DREAMERS, AND STRIVERS THAT IS BEING LED  BY A GROUP OF CENSORS, CRITICS, AND CYNICS. REMEMBER: ALL OF THE PEOPLE TELLING YOU YOU CAN'T HAVE THE COUNTRY YOU WANT, ARE THE SAME PEOPLE, THAT WOULD NOT STAND, I  MEAN THEY SAID TRUMP DOES NOT  HAVE A CHANCE OF BEING HERE  TONIGHT, NOT A CHANCE, THE SAME PEOPLE. WE LOVE DEFEATING THOSE PEOPLE, DON'T WE?  LOVE IT. NO LONGER CAN WE RELY ON THOSE  SAME PEOPLE. IN THE MEDIA AND POLITICS WHO , WILL SAY ANYTHING TO KEEP A RIGGED SYSTEM IN PLACE. INSTEAD, WE MUST CHOOSE TO  BELIEVE IN AMERICA.  HISTORY IS WATCHING US NOW. IT'S WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. IT'S WAITING TO SEE IF WE WILL  RISE TO THE OCCASION, AND IF WE  WILL SHOW THE WHOLE WORLD THAT  AMERICA IS STILL FREE AND  INDEPENDENT AND STRONG. MY   I AM ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT TONIGHT SO THAT I CAN BE YEAR  CHAMPION IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND I WILL BE A CHAMPION. -- YOUR CHAMPION.  MY OPPONENT ASKS HER SUPPORTERS TO RECITE A THREE-WORD LOYALTY PLEDGE.  IT READS: ""I'M WITH HER"". I I CHOOSE TO RECITE A DIFFERENT PLEDGE. MY PLEDGE READS: ""I'M WITH YOU  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.""  I AM YOUR VOICE.  SO TO EVERY PARENT WHO DREAMS  FOR THEIR CHILD, AND EVERY CHILD  WHO DREAMS FOR THEIR FUTURE, I  SAY THESE WORDS TO YOU TONIGHT:  I'M WITH YOU, AND I WILL FIGHT  FOR YOU, AND I WILL WIN FOR YOU.  TO ALL AMERICANS TONIGHT, IN ALL  OUR CITIES AND TOWNS, I MAKE  THIS PROMISE: WE WILL MAKE  AMERICA STRONG AGAIN.  WE WILL MAKE AMERICA PROUD AGAIN.  WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.   AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! GOD BLESS YOU AND GOOD NIGHT!  I LOVE  YOU!    >>",Donald Trump 2016 Acceptance Speech
61,2016-07-22,http://www.c-span.org/video/?413063-1/donald-trump-says-wont-accept-endorsement-senator-cruz,"[u'mike pence', u'donald j. trump', u'dan scavino', u'donald j. trump', u'mike pence', u'donald j. trump']",Trump,"  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAD AN AMAZING CONVENTION. I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST EVER. IN TERMS OF ENTHUSIASM, IN TERMS OF WHAT IT REPRESENTS, GETTING OUR WORD OUT, IVANKA WAS INCREDIBLE LAST NIGHT. SHE DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB. SO MANY OF THE SPEAKERS ARE SO AMAZING AND GROUND SETTING. IT WAS JUST SOMETHING VERY, VERY SPECIAL. YOU ARE EVEN GETTING GOOD MARKS ON TELEVISION. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? HARD TO BELIEVE. THEY WILL CHANGE, DON'T WORRY. BUT IT HAS BEEN JUST AN INCREDIBLE FOUR DAYS. I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF CLEVELAND AND THE PEOPLE OF OHIO, BECAUSE, I MEAN, WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. WE READ TWO OR THREE WEEKS AGO, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE RIOTS, PROBLEMS, EVERYTHING WAS A PROBLEM, A PROBLEM. THIS WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST PEACEFUL, ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL, ONE OF THE MOST LOVE-FILLED CONVENTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF CONVENTIONS. AND WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT UNITY, THAT WAS UNITY. THAT WAS UNITY, RIGHT? I SAW YOU LAST NIGHT. THAT WAS UNITY. THAT WAS AMAZING. AND THE PARTY HAS JUST COME TOGETHER. THE PARTY HAS COME TOGETHER, AND THE FEW PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT THERE, IT IS OK. YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND, I RAN AS AN OUTSIDER. I DID NOT WANT ANYBODY. NOW I HAVE GUYS LIKE MIKE PENCE. SYSTEM SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. IF I DO NOT WIN, I CAN BLAME MIKE. WANT TO THANK A NUMBER OF PEOPLE BECAUSE, IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE GOING TO LEAVE OUT SOME BECAUSE THAT HAPPENS AND IT IS ALWAYS VERY SAD. I'M A REAL ESTATE GUY. I BUILT BUILDINGS AND I BUILD THINGS. THAT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SET I HAVE EVER SEEN, NOT ONLY FOR CONVENTIONS, BUT FOR ANYTHING. AND THE FOLKS WHO WORKED ON THAT, ESPECIALLY, THE CARPENTERS, THE ELECTRICIANS, WE FORGET ABOUT THIS STUFF. THOSE SHEETROCKERS UP THERE, HE SAID, WE JUST CUT IT, I DO WHAT YOU DO, BUT YOU DO NOT SEE IT VERY MUCH. WE HAVE THE CHAIRMAN FROM NEW YORK, MY MAN, MY LEADER. WE ARE GOING TO WIN NEW YORK. WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO WIN NEW YORK. IF WE WIN NEW YORK, IT IS OVER, RIGHT? IT IS OVER. THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. A FEW OF THE PEOPLE, HAROLD IS HERE. WHERE IS HAROLD? OH, BOY, BARRY SWITZER, GREAT FOOTBALL COACH, HE IS HAROLD'S BEST FRIEND, OR ONE OF THEM, SO HE CAME UP TO MY OFFICE AND HE SAID, MR. TRUMP, HAROLD IS ONE OF THE GREAT ENERGY TYCOONS, BUT FROM OUR STANDPOINT, ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT REALLY UNDERSTAND ENERGY BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE. WE HIRED THESE CONSULTANTS. THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. IF THEY WERE ANY GOOD, THEY WOULD BE WORTH $10 BILLION. AND BARRY SWITZER IS A TOUGH COOKIE, A GOOD GUY. HE SAID, YOU KNOW, MR. TRUMP, THAT HAROLD, HE IS MY FRIEND COME UP WITH OTHER COMPANIES, THEY SPENT LOADS OF DOLLARS LOOKING FOR OIL. THAT GUY TAKES A STRONG, PUTS IT IN THE GROUND, AND OIL OPOURS OUT OF IT. THAT IS THE GUY THAT WE WANT TALKING TO US ABOUT ENERGY. WE WANT THE REAL PLAYERS. WE DO NOT WANT THE CONSULTANTS. WE DO NOT WANT THE GUYS HE HIRES. WE WANT HIM. HAROLD, IT IS GREAT YOU ARE HERE. OR SPEECH WAS TERRIFIC, BY THE WAY. HE ALSO HAVE, AND I THINK VERY IMPORTANT, JEFF SESSIONS, WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE HERE, THAT I WANT TO TELL YOU, HE WAS THE FIRST ONE, MIKE, HE WAS RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING, AND HE IS SO HIGHLY RESPECTED, AND I MISS IT, TED CRUZ HAS SO MUCH RESPECT FOR JEFF SESSIONS. AND EVERYBODY KNEW THAT JEFF SESSIONS WAS GOING TO BE WITH TED CRUZ DURING THE CAMPAIGN. AND JUST SAID, I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE WHAT HAS HAPPENED. YOU HAVE A MOVEMENT GOING ON. HE WAS THE FIRST BIG PLAYER, U.S. SENATOR, HIGHLY RESPECTED BY REBUTTED, ONE OF THE RESTORED PEOPLE, AND LOW KEY. I LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT LOW-TKEY GENIES. HE SAID, WHY DON'T YOU TRY TO GET THIS RIGHT? I THINK THAT IS GENIUS. JEFF SESSIONS WAS AT THE BEGINNING AND IT WAS A HUGE UPSET BECAUSE WHEN JEFF CAME ON, EVERYBODY THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO ROUTINELY BE WITH TED, AND FRANKLY, HE HAS NEVER ENDORSED ANYBODY BEFORE. HE IS NOT AN ENDORSER. HE IS CALLED A TOUGH ENDORSEMENT, AND HE ENDORSED ME AND THAT WAS A FANTASTIC THING, AND HE HAS BEEN A GREAT HELP EVER SENSE. JEFF SESSIONS, I APPRECIATE YOU. JEFF LARSON IS AROUND HERE SOMEPLACE. HE IS AROUND HERE SOMEPLACE. WHAT A JOB JEFF DID. ERREINCE WAS A SUPERSTAR. HE IS PROBABLY ON A PLANE. HE WORKS SO HARD, AND WE ARE RAISING MONEY, AND THE NICE THING, I PUT IN OVER $60 MILLION. THAT'S MONTH I THINK I PUT IN $3.8 MILLION, AND WE ARE RAISING MONEY FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL THING. I CANNOT GUARANTEE THESE FIGURES, BUT I HEARD YESTERDAY ALONE WAS LIKE 3.5 MILLION DOLLARS FROM SMALL DONORS. THE AVERAGE DONATION WAS JUST OVER $50. AND WE ARE RAISING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM THE SMALL DONORS. TO ME THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT IN A SENSE. HAROLD CAN WRITE HIS CHECKS, A HAROLD IS ONLY ONE VOTE, RIGHT? THESE OTHER PEOPLE GIVE YOU 50 BUCKS, BUT THEY VOTE BY THE MILLIONS. THAT IS WHAT WE WANT. TO HELL WITH HAROLD, RIGHT? BUT WE HAD JUST TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF PEOPLE'S COMING IN, AND WE ARE BUILDING UP A WAR CHEST THAT WILL BE GREAT, AND I AM CONTINUING TO FUND MY CAMPAIGN, LARG PORTIONS OFE IT. I THOUGHT I GAVE $2 MILLION LAST MONTH, AND THEY SAID, YOU ACTUALLY GAVE $3.8 MILLION. IT IS ALWAYS GOOD WHEN YOU GAVE AND YOU DO NOT KNOW AND IT DOES NOT MATTER. I DO NOT EVEN GET ANGRY AT ANYBODY, RIGHT? I HAVE OVER $60 MILLION BECAUSE I SAID I WAS GOING TO FUND THE PRIMARIES, AND SO WE JUST KEEP GOING ALONG, RIGHT? I WILL TELL YOU, IT IS AN HONOR, AND I HAVE SAID THIS. A LOT OF THE TELEVISION PEOPLE HAVE COME UP TO ME AND ONE VERY HIGHLY RESPECTED WRITER CALLED UP AND TOLD THAT STORY, AND HE SAID WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS INCREDIBLE. AND THIS WAS ACTUALLY IN SEPTEMBER, THEY CALLED IF THE SUMMER OF TRUMP. HE SAID WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS INCREDIBLE. NOTHING IS INCREDIBLE UNLESS I WIN, AND I WAS NOT TALKING ABOUT THE PRIMARIES. HE SAID, NO, NO, WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS INCREDIBLE. IT HAS BEEN THE SUMMER OF TRUMP. IT IS DONE IN THE HISTORY BOOKS. THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING ABOUT IT. BILL O'REILLY SAID THE SINGLE GREATEST PHENOMENA HE HAS EVER SEEN HIS LIFE. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. DID YOU SEE THAT. -- DID YOU SEE THAT? AND BRIT HUME SAID IT. YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND, I DO NOT CARE. I DO NOT DO ANYTHING UNLESS I WIN, AND I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THE PRIMARIES, BECAUSE OTHERWISE, WHAT HAVE WE DONE? LIKE IT A CALL FROM SOME OF THE ELSE A MONTH AGO SAYING THE SAME THING, BUT NOW IT WAS THE SUMMER OF TRUMP, IT WAS THE AUTUMN OF CHILDREN, IT WAS THE CHRISTMAS OF TRUMP, IT WAS EVERYTHING, AND IT IS REALLY A BEAUT BECAUSE IT, IS A MOVEMENT. I WAS ON THE COVER OF ""TIME"" AGAIN THIS WEEK. I WAS ON THE COVER TWICE IN MY LIFE, AND LIKE SIX TIMES IN LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS. YOU TELL ME, WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT, REAL ESTATE OR POLITICS, OK? IS THAT TRUE, HAROLD? I HAVE SIX FOR POLITICS OR TWO FOR REAL ESTATE, AND IT HAS BEEN AMAZING. I SAID, LOOK, IT REALLY TO MEET MATTERS. THEY SAID, NO, BELIEVE ME, WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS IN THE HISTORY BOOKS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. I WIN THE PRIMARIES, THIS IS CRAZY, AND IT DOES NOT MATTER UNLESS WE BEAT HILLARY CLINTON, AND I MEAN BEAT HER HANDILY -- I WILL CONSIDER IT, AND I SHOULD NOT SAY IT, BECAUSE IF IT DOES NOT WORK OUT, YOU CAN SAY, I DID A GOOD JOB, BUT I'VE HEARD IT MYSELF BY SAYING THIS. IF I DO NOT WIN, MEANING THAT FINAL STAGE, BEAT 17 PEOPLE, BECAUSE 17, INCLUDING DESK IT WAS AT LEAST 70 BECAUSE THERE WAS ONE WE DO NOT EVEN TALK ABOUT, WHO JOINED, WHO LEFT HER A STATEMENT, HE WAS GONE. AND THEN DO NOT FORGET IT, HILLARY HAD A COUPLE OF GUYS WHO DROPPED OUT AND BERNIE WAS TOUGH . WE ARE GOING TO GET A LOT OF THE PARTY VOTERS, BY THE WAY. THEY DID NOT TREAT BERNIE WRITES. I DO NOT LIKKNOW BERNIE. THEY DID NOT TREAT BERNIE RIGHT. HILLARY'S PEOPLE JUST SWAMPED IN. YOU ARE LOOKING AT DEBORAH WASSERMAN SCHULTZ -- I WILL TAKE REINCE OVER HER ANY DAY IN TERMS OF CONFIDENCE. NOT FOR BEING NICE AND REALLY, WHO CARES? I WILL TAKE REINCE --I WILL TELL YOU THAT I THINK WE ARE GOING TO GET A LOT OF HIS VOTERS AS OF THE TRADE ISSUE. BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND BECAUSE OF THE TRADE ISSUE. WE WILL GET A LOT OF THEIR VOTERS. I WANT TO THANK STEVE KING. WHERE IS STEVE KING? WHERE? THANK YOU, STEVE. I WANT TO THANK SOME OF OUR SECURITY GUYS. THE SECRET SERVICE IS WONDERFUL.  WONDERFUL. THEY HAVE BEEN HIT A LITTLE BIT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS TO LET ME TELL YOU, THESE GUYS ARE. I'M THE BEST AND THAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE SECRET SERVICE BECAUSE I GO AROUND SAYING HOW GREAT THEY ARE. THESE ARE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE. I WANT TO THANK THE SECRETS NERVOUS. I WANT TO THANK THE POLICE OF CLEVELAND, THE CLEVELAND POLICE DEPARTMENT. I WANT TO THANK THE POLICE CHIEF. HE IS AMAZING. HE HAS DONE SOME JOB WORKING WITH ALL OF THE FOLKS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. YOU HEARD LAST NIGHT WE WILL BE PROTECTING LAW ENFORCEMENT. I WANT TO THANK EDDIE DID. IS EDDIE HERE? BECOME FAMOUS. IS BECOMING MORE FAMOUS AND ME. AND YOUR POLICE CHIEF HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB IN CLEVELAND. IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE FOLKS, DAVID GILBERT. WHERE IS DAVID? CHRIS CONNOR. CHRIS KELLY. DON'T BOTHER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME UP AND SPEAK. BRIAN JACK. WHAT A JOB YOU DID, BRIAN. NOW YOU CAN LEAVE AND GO TO THE NEXT LOCATION, BRIAN. HILLARY IS TRYING TO PICK HER VICE PRESIDENT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO TAKE AWAY A LITTLE OF THE SUCCESS THAT WE HAD AT THIS CONVENTION. THIS CONVENTION HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS EXCESS. IF YOU TURN ON TELEVISION, YOU WILL SEE. SOMEBODY GOT BOOED BY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. THERE MAY NOT BE UNITY. THERE WAS NOT ONE PERSON IN THE ROOM INCLUDING THE TECH IS DELEGATION. HE MAY HAVE RUINED HIS LYRICAL CAREER. I FEEL SO BAD. HE WILL COME AND ENDORSE. I DON'T WANT HIS ENDORSEMENT. I HAVE SUCH GREAT ENDORSEMENTS. TAD, STAY HOME, RELAX, ENJOY YOURSELF. WHEN YOU GO UP, IT'S A BORING SPEECH. AND HERE'S THE SPEECH. AND HE ADDED A SENTENCE. HE GOT UP AND HE ADDED A SENTENCE WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN VIEWED AS A NASTY THING IN TERMS OF WHAT HE SAID BECAUSE IT WAS IMPLYING SOMETHING THAT THAT'S OK. AND YOU ARE BOUND BY THAT'S LIKE YOU ARE BOUND BY THE PLEDGE. TED CRUZ TO A SPEECH THAT WAS DONE, IT WAS ON THE TELEPROMPTER. AND HE MADE A STATEMENT THAT WASN'T ON HIS SPEECH AND THEN WENT BACK TO HIS SPEECH. TO ME, THAT IS DISHONORABLE. NOT SIGNING UP EDGE IS DISHONORABLE. NOT A NICE THING TO DO. I TALK THIS WAY BECAUSE WE ARE ALL TOGETHER AND WE CREATED ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL CONVENTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF CONVENTIONS. AND THE RATINGS WERE THROUGH THE ROOF. I GET A KICK OUT OF CNN. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS A SUCCESSFUL CONVENTION. ALL THEY TALK ABOUT HIS TRUNK -- IS TRUMP AND THE CONVENTION. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, MILANI AT A GREAT JOB. AND THE PRESENTATION IS SO BEING TALKED ABOUT. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BEACH. IF VODKA -- IVANKA LAST NIGHT, UNBELIEVABLE. TO HAVE THAT KIND OF AN INTRODUCTION. AND TIFFANY, THE BIGGEST GROUP'S 22 PEOPLE IN A CLASSROOM. TIFFANY WAS AMAZING. I JUST DON'T WANT THEM RUNNING FOR POLITICAL OFFICE BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S GOT TO A BEHIND AND RUN THE BUSINESS. I GET A KICK BECAUSE THE RATINGS ON TELEVISION ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. THIS IS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS. IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT BUT NOBODY'S GOING TO WATCH THIS NEXT CONVENTION. I'M GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME WATCHING HER FINAL SPEECH. NUMBER ONE, I KNOW HER TOO WELL. NUMBER TWO, BORING. 25 MINUTES AND IT WASN'T I FAULT. THE NETWORKS HAD ALL OF THEIR BIG PROGRAMMING. THE LOCAL NEWS IS A VERY BIG FACTOR. THEY ALL MOVED IT. THEY SAID, TO HECK WITH THE LOCAL NEWS. WE ARE MOVING IT. JIMMY KIMMEL, JIMMY FALLON, THEY WENT BACK. THEY WEREN'T GOING TO MISS THIS CONVENTION. LET'S KEEP GOING. BUT IT WASN'T MY FAULT. WHAT HAPPENED, THE APPLAUSE WAS SO LONG AND NO CRAZY, IT REALLY WAS. IF YOU LOOK, THE SPEECH WAS FINE BUT THE APPLAUSE WAS LONGER THAN THIS EACH. HONESTLY, THAT WAS ALL ABOUT UNITY. WE MAY BE MISSING A COUPLE OF PEOPLE. I LIKE TED, HE'S FINE. I DON'T WANT HIS ENDORSEMENT. IF HE GIVES IT, I WILL NOT ACCEPT IT. HE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT BECAUSE -- I DON'T SEE HIM WINNING ANYWAY BUT IF HE DID, THAT'S FINE. MAYBE I WILL SET UP A SUPER PAC IF HE DECIDES TO RUN. ARE YOU ALLOWED TO SET UP A SUPER PAC IF YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT? BUT THERE WERE TWO THINGS HE SAID YESTERDAY. I DIDN'T START ANYTHING THE WIFE. A PAC RELEASE A COVER STORY ON MY WIFE WHO IS A TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL AND ELEGANT NOVEL. AND SHE WAS ON THE COVER OF GQ MAGAZINE. IT'S NOT EXACTLY PENTHOUSE. SHE WAS ON THE COVER OF GQ MAGAZINE, AND ART PICTURE. SHE WAS A MODEL. SHE DIDN'T NEED TO MARRY ME. SHE WAS MAKING A LOT OF HONEY. I HAD TO WORK HARD TO GET HER TO MARRY ME. IT WASN'T THAT HE. YOU THINK I'M KIDDING. SO THEY RELEASED THIS PICTURE WHICH WAS, YOU KNOW -- TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF UTAH, I LOVE YOU. BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE YOU WANT TO SEND A RISQUE PICTURE. AND I DON'T THINK THEY SHOWED IT WAS GQ. THEY TOOK THE GQ OFF AND JUST CUT ALL THE STUFF OUT. THEY DIDN'T SAY IT WAS A MAGAZINE COVER. AND IT WAS MELANIA TRUMP. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. I THINK, BY THE WAY, SHE IS A VERY NICE WOMAN AND A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. I THINK HEIDI CRUISES A GREAT PERSON. I THINK IT'S THE BEST THING HE'S GOT GOING, AND HIS KIDS, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. ALTHOUGH HE'S GOT GOOD INTELLECT BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT. AND HE WAS A GOOD DEBATER BUT HE DIDN'T DO WELL IN THE DEBATES AGAINST ME A ORTING TO EVERY POLL. HE LOST IN EVERY SINGLE ONE. THAT TAKES CARE OF THE HEIDI THING. IT WAS A TERRIFIC WOMAN. THAT WAS A PAC. A LOT OF US ARE POLITICAL PEOPLE. WE ARE NOT BABIES. HIS PEOPLE RUN THE PAC . HE SAID WE HAD NOTHING TO DO. YOU COULD TRACE IT WITH E-MAILS BUT THEY ARE PRETTY SMART. PROBABLY JUST PHONE CALLS. IT WAS A TED CRUZ SUPER PAC. HE SAID IT WASN'T REALLY MEANT FOR US. SO THEY SENT OUT THE FIRST. I DON'T KNOW HIS FATHER, I MET HIM ONCE. ALL I DID WAS POINT OUT THE FACT THAT ON THE COVER OF THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER, THERE IS A PICTURE OF CRAZY LEE HARVEY OSWALD HAVING DIRECT. TED NEVER DENIED IT WAS HIS FATHER BUT I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. IT WAS A MAGAZINE THAT FRANKLY, IN MANY RESPECTS, SHOULD BE VERY RESPECTFUL. THEY GOT OJ, THEY GOT EDWARD. IF IT WAS THE NEW YORK TIMES, THEY WOULD'VE GOTTEN FULL OF SURPRISES. WHY DIDN'T THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER GET THE PULITZER PRIZE? O.J. SIMPSON AND ALL OF THESE THINGS. SO THEY HAVE A PICTURE. I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING. HERE IS HOW THE PRESS TAKES THAT STORY. EXCEPT IT MIGHT HAVE POINTED IT OUT. BUT THEY NEVER DENIED, DID ANYBODY DENY THAT IT WAS THE FATHER? HERE'S A STORY. THE PRESS TAKES THAT AND THEY SAY DONALD TRUMP AND HIS CURACY THEORIES, HE WENT OUT AND SAID HIS FATHER WAS WITH LEE HARVEY OSWALD AND HE ASSESS DATED THE PRESIDENT. WHAT DID I DO? THOSE ARE THE TWO POINTS. NUMBER ONE, YOU UNDERSTAND NOW. I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HIS FATHER. I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT LEE HARVEY OSWALD. BUT THERE WAS A PICTURE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER WHICH DOES HAVE THAT ABILITY. THEY GET SUED FOR A LOT OF MONEY. THAT IS THE ONLY THING I KNOW. THEY USE THE TWO THINGS AS THE REASON. IF PEOPLE REALLY DISLIKE ME, AND I DON'T THEY DO ANYMORE. HOW BAD CAN I BE? AND THEY LOVE THEIR DADDY. I WAS A GOOD FATHER. I'M GETTING A LOT OF CREDIT. MY CHILDREN WERE REALLY, PEOPLE SAY THEY WERE THIS OURS. I'M SO PROUD OF THEM. THIS WAS AN AMAZING TIME. THIS WAS AN AMAZING CONVENTION. SEE HIM ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK. THIS GUY, IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I AM LOOK UP IN SEVEN. HE'S ALWAYS LOOKING DOWN. NO ONE KNOWS THAT STUFF BETTER. WHAT ARE TO GIVE A QUICK REPORT BECAUSE A QUICK REPORT BECAUSE I HEAR THE NUMBERS ARE ASTRONOMICAL. WE ARE DEALING IN A MODERN AGE. UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE DEALING  ONE OF MY GOOD CHOICES IN LIFE, I WILL CONFIRM THAT IN ABOUT 3.I'VE MONTH FROM NOW. BUT I BELIEVE IT WILL BE ONE OF MY GREAT DECISIONS, TAKING MIKE PENCE TO RUN ALONG WITH ME. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK GOVERNOR PENCE FROM THE GREAT STATE OF INDIANA, AND WE LOVE INDIANA AND BOBBY KNIGHT. AND LOU HALL, AND YOUR WONDERFUL GENE FROM PURDUE. WE HAVE A LOT OF COACHES OUT THERE.  ONE THING I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT HIS SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. WHETHER YOU'RE THE GOVERNOR OF OHIO, OR ANY OF THE OTHER PEOPLE LIKE THE SO EASILY AND ARE BADLY. IF HILLARY CLINTON GETS IN, SHE IS GOING TO REPLACE. I CALLED HIM OUR BELOVED JUSTICE SCALIA. WE ARE GOING TO GET SOMEBODY IS CLOSE TO HIM AND HIS VIEWS AND PHILOSOPHY AS POSSIBLE. ALL THE THINGS YOU WANT, THE THINGS WE STAND FOR AS A PARTY. I HAVE AN IDEA. THEY HAVE NOT DONE SO WELL WITH THE JUDGES, HAVE THEY? WE HAVE OBAMA CARE THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN KNOCKED OUT TWICE BECAUSE OF AN APPOINTMENT. THE MATTER WHAT YOU THINK OF DONALD TRUMP, AS A REPUBLICAN, IF THAT IS WHAT YOUR PHILOSOPHY IS, IF YOU ARE A GREAT BELIEVER IN THE CONST FUSION -- CONSTITUTION. I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ONE THEATER IN THAT ROOM AND THAT IS A FACT. THERE WERE NO SEATS -- THEY WERE SELLING FOR A LOT OF MONEY ON EBAY. THERE WERE GOING FOR BIG NUMBERS. I WAS THINKING ABOUT TAKING 10 AT 12 TICKETS. BUT THEY WERE SELLING FOR A LOT OF MONEY. JUST REMEMBER, SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. I WANT TO FINISH WITH THIS. WE'VE HAD SOME INCREDIBLE SUPPORT. SOME OF THESE PUNDITS SAY YOU CAN'T DO THAT, THESE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE SAYING THAT IF HE RUNS, BUT HE WON'T RUN. BUT THEY GO, BUT HE WON'T WIN. THAT IS A CEILING. HE CAN DO MORE THAN THAT. WE GO FROM SIX, RIGHT? I SAW THEM HE WILL NOT RUN AND IF HE DOES, HE WILL JUST BE DOING IT FOR FUN. IT'S A LOT OF WORK, FOLKS. THIS WASN'T EXACTLY THE SCHEDULE. I SAW HOW BADLY OUR COUNTRY IS DOING AND HOW EASY IT WILL BE TO BRING BACK. TRADE DEALS ALONE WILL MAKE AN IMPACT LIKE YOU WON'T. WE ARE TAKING CARE OF OTHER NATIONS AND I WANT TO AND YOU TO TAKE CARE OF OTHER NATIONS. BUT THEY HAVE TO PAY US. I NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD IT BECAUSE THE UNITED DATES SPENDS 10 TIMES THE MONEY ON THE MILITARY. I REALIZED WE'RE PROTECTING EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD. OUR RICH NATIONS. JAPAN SINCE THEIR CARS, MAKE A FORTUNE, AND THEY DON'T PAY US. YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO WALK. HILLARY CLINTON CAME OUT. THOSE CARS ARE FLOWING. THOSE CARS, YOU GO TO LOS ANGELES AND TO THE MASSIVE SHAPES. IT LOOKS LIKE NASCAR. I LOVE NASCAR. A LOT OF THE GREAT DRIVERS ENDORSE ME. KING RICHARD. IT'S LIKE RICHARD PETTY DRIVING ABOUT -- DRIVING IT. AND THEY DON'T PAY US. IN THE GENERAL SAYS, MR. TRUMP IS WRONG. DOESN'T HE UNDERSTAND THAT JAPAN PAYS IS 50% OF THE COST OF DEFENDING THEM. WHY ARE THEY PAYING 100%? AND GERMANY, SOUTH KOREA, 28,000 SOLDIERS. SAUDI ARABIA BE THERE. THEY HAVE NOTHING BUT MONEY. THEY HAVE SO MUCH MONEY AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. WHO IS MAKING THE DEALS FOR US? ONE DEAL LIKE THAT HAS A MASSIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUDGET, ON OUR ECONOMICS IS A COUNTRY. WE ARE UP TO 19 TRILLION AND WE WILL BE $21 TRILLION. I COULD SAY, TELL ME WHAT A TRILLION DOLLARS IS. BUT YOU KNOW, HONESTLY? IT IS SO MUCH. THEY WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO DEFINE IT. WE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL AND OUR MESSAGE CAUGHT ON. WHEN I STARTED THIS, WE HAD THESE PUNDITS SAYING IT WON'T HAPPEN. I JUST HAVE TO TELL YOU. IT'S GREAT. AND HE'S BEEN VERY LOYAL AND HE'S IN ON CNN. HE'S BEEN FIGHTING FOR ME, WHICH IS VERY NICE. I WAS AT THAT A LOT. HOPE, COME HERE. GET UP HERE, HOPE. COME ON UP HERE. SHE IS SHY. GET HER UP HERE. COME ON. WE HAVE A SMALL BUT TOUGH TEAM. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO LIFT YOU OVER THAT BARRICADE, PROBABLY. SHE IS A VERY SHY PERSON BUT SHE IS A GREAT PERSON AND HAS DONE AN AMAZING JOB. WE HAD A STAFF OF GEORGE -- WHERE'S GEORGE? STAND OVER HERE? I GET HOPE UP WHAT SHE CAN GET TO THE SECRET SERVICE PEOPLE THERE. WE HAD A SMALL STAFF AND I GOT CHRIS IS FOR IT. SO IN SO HAS SPENT MANY TIMES WHAT TRUMP HAS THAT. AND THEN WE WIN. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GET CREDIT IF YOU HAVE SMALLER STAFF, LESS PAYROLL, AND YOU WIN. BUT IN POLITICS, YOU DON'T GET CREDIT. I WANT TO THANK MY ENTIRE GROUP. IN THE FINAL STRETCH, PAUL MANNA FORD HAS DONE AN AMAZING JOB. GOOD. WE MADE IT. HE HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB. AND ALL OF PAUL'S PEOPLE WE HAVE A GREAT STAFF OF TALENTED PEOPLE. MOST OF THEM ARE RIGHT HERE. AND MICHAEL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE MICHAEL. COME ON UP. IT GET A LITTLE TV TIME. I DON'T KNOW IF HE WILL BE HIRED FOR HOLLYWOOD. I TEND TO DOUBT IT, BUT YOU NEVER KNOW. WE HAVE A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE. WE HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO WIN AND I THINK KNOWS HOW TO WIN. AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN WINNING ALL OUR LIVES. WE'VE BEEN WINNING ALL OUR LIVES. WE'VE GOT EXACTLY THREE AND THREE WEEKS. I'M NOT GOING TO DO LIKE LAST TIME WHERE THEY DISAPPEAR THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF. GIVE OBAMA CREDIT, HE WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO DISAPPEAR. WE HAVE A REALLY GREAT CHANCE OF TAKING OUR COUNTRY BACK OF CHANGE AND OF  >> WE ARE GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY. WHEN WE GET THERE, WE WILL INDEED MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.   >>","Donald Trump Remarks in Cleveland, Ohio"

MR. TRUMP: THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.  GREAT HONOR. GREAT HONOR. THANK YOU. THIS IS A WONDERFUL DAY.  ON A SATURDAY  MORNING.  IS THAT NOT NICE? THANK YOU.  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLE CONVENTION.  WE WILL GET THINGS SOLVED AND DO  LOTS OF WONDERFUL THINGS FOR OUR  COUNTRY, MOST IMPORTANTLY. I AM HERE TODAY TO INTRODUCE THE  MAN WHO WILL BE MY PARTNER IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND THE WHITE  HOUSE, TO FIX OUR RIGGED SYSTEM. WE ARE IN A RIGGED, RIGGED  SYSTEM, AND TO MAKE AMERICA SAFE  AGAIN, AND TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.   I WANT TO ALSO  ADDRESS THE ISLAMIC TERROR  ATTACK IN FRANCE.  WE HAVE WITNESSED HORROR BEYOND  THE LEAF. NO MATTER WHERE YOU LOOK, AND  NOW IT IS HAPPENING MORE AND  MORE. AND IT IS NEVER GOING TO STOP. WE NEED NEW LEADERSHIP. WE NEED NEW THINKING. WE NEED STRENGTH. WE NEED, IN OUR COUNTRY, LAW AND ORDER. AND IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT,  THAT WILL HAPPEN.   I WANT TO EXPRESS OUR  UNYIELDING SUPPORT FOR THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE. WE MOURN THEIR LOSS AS A NATION.  AS FAR AS TURKEY IS CONCERNED, SO MANY FRIENDS IN TURKEY, GREAT PEOPLE, AMAZING PEOPLE.  WE WISH THEM WELL.  IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE RESOLVING THE DIFFICULTY, BUT WE WISH THEM WELL. A LOT OF ANGUISH LAST NIGHT, BUT HOPEFULLY, IT WILL ALL WORK OUT. NOW AS, HOPEFULLY, AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I WANT TO REFER BACK TO WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS.  THE MIDDLE EAST TODAY IS MORE  UNSTABLE THAN EVER BEFORE. IT HAS NEVER BEEN LIKE THIS -- OUT OF CONTROL.  AFTER FOUR YEARS OF CLINTON, WHO  REALLY LED THE WAY AND LED OBAMA  DOWN A HORRIBLE PATH, AS I DO  NOT EVEN THINK HE COULD HAVE  MADE THESE DECISIONS SO BADLY,  SHE LED HIM RIGHT DOWN A  HORRIBLE PASS. HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING.  IRAQ, SYRIA, ALL INTO CHAOS.  AND IRAN IS ON A PATH TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  AND ON TOP OF THAT, WE GAVE THEM BACK $150 BILLION AND WE DID NOT  GET OUR HOSTAGES UNTIL THE END.  NOW WE ARE SEEING UNREST IN  TURKEY, A FURTHER DEMONSTRATION  OF THE FAILURES OF OBAMA-CLINTON. YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK.  EVERY SINGLE THING THEY TOUCHED  HAS TURNED TO HORRIBLE,  HORRIBLE, DEATH-DEFYING PROBLEMS. WE ALSO NEED TO BRING BACK, IN  THIS COUNTRY, AS WE SEE WHAT HAPPENED, OUR INDUSTRY, OUR MANUFACTURING, OUR JOBS. THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY LIKE  WE ARE BABIES, TAKEN AWAY. WE ARE GOING TO BRING THEM BACK. I HAVE FOUND THE LEADER WHO WILL HELP US DELIVER A SAFE SOCIETY AND A PROSPEROUS, REALLY PROSPEROUS SOCIETY FOR ALL OF  AMERICA.  INDIANA GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE WAS  MY FIRST CHOICE.  I HAVE ADMIRED THE WORK HE HAS DONE, ESPECIALLY IN THE STATE OF INDIANA.  AND I AM GOING TO GO OVER SOME  OF THOSE ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN JUST  A MINUTE.  BUT I ALSO ADMIRE THE FACT THAT  HE FIGHTS FOR THE PEOPLE, AND HE  IS GOING TO FIGHT FOR YOU.  HE IS A SOLID, SOLID PERSON.   GOVERNOR PENCE SERVED  INDIANA WITH DISTINCTION IN CONGRESS.  HE ROSE TO LEADERSHIP AND SERVED  AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ENTIRE  HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE,  NUMBER ONE.  HE HAS REALLY GOT THE SKILLS OF  A HIGHLY TALENTED EXECUTIVE,  LEADING THE STATE OF INDIANA TO  JOBS, GROWTH, AND OPPORTUNITY IN  SPITE OF THE RELENTLESS  OBSTACLES PUT IN HIS WAY AND  EVERY STATE'S WAY BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. IT IS HORRIBLE OUT THERE. HIGH TAXES AND REGULATIONS.  IT IS OUT OF CONTROL.  MIKE PENCE IS A MAN OF HONOR,  CHARACTER, AND HONESTY. WE KNOW THAT.  HILLARY CLINTON IS THE  EMBODIMENT OF CORRUPTION.  SHE IS A CORRUPT PERSON.  WHAT SHE HAS DONE WITH HER  E-MAILS, WHAT SHE HAS DONE WITH  SO MANY THINGS, AND I SEE THE  ADS UP ALL OF THE TIME. SHE IS TOTALLY BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY WALL STREET, THE SPECIAL INTERESTS, AND THE LOBBYISTS, 100%. SHE IS CROOKED HILLARY.   AND I THINK, THAT WHILE SHE GOT AWAY WITH MURDER,  IN FACT I THINK IT MIGHT BE HER  GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT,  ESCAPING THE RECENT SCANDAL AND  HER LIES AND THE LOSS OF 33,000 E-MAILS.  BUT IT WASN'T A LOSS.  THAT IN ITSELF IS A MAJOR CRIME.  OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PAYING  TREMENDOUS PRICES FOR WHAT THEY  HAVE DONE, WHICH IS PEANUTS  COMPARED TO WHAT HAPPENED WITH  HILLARY CLINTON.  33,000 E-MAILS ARE MISSING, AND  THAT IS OK?  DIDN'T GIVE THEM TO THE FBI?  DIDN'T GIVE THEM TO THE ATTORNEY  GENERAL, AND THAT IS OK?  WIPES HER SERVER CLEAN, THAT'S OK?  THESE ARE CRIMES.  THESE ARE CRIMES.  AND HOW SHE GOT AWAY WITH IT, I  THINK I UNDERSTAND IT, BUT I  THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T. BUT I DO BELIEVE, SHE DID NOT  PAY THE PRICE SHE SHOULD HAVE  PAID, SHE IS GOING TO PAY THAT PRICE WHEN NOVEMBER 8 ROLLS  AROUND. SHE IS GOING TO PAY IT AT THE POLLS.  I BELIEVE IT.   ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE, HILLARY MADE $21.6 MILLION  GIVING SPEECHES TO SPECIAL INTERESTS IN A SHORT PERIOD OF  TIME.  SHE IS TOTALLY OWNED BY WALL STREET.  WE BELIEVE IN AMERICANISM. SHE BELIEVES IN GLOBALISM, AND IT'S NOT THAT SHE BELIEVES IN  IT.  THE PEOPLE THAT GIVE HER ALL OF  THIS MONEY BELIEVES IN IT, AND  SHE WILL BELIEVE WHATEVER THEY  WANT HER TO BELIEVE. BELIEVE ME.  THAT IS IT.   WHAT A DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON  AND MIKE PENCE.   MIKE PENCE WILL NEVER  BE AFRAID TO SPEAK THE NAME OF  OUR ENEMY, RADICAL ISLAM,  RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM.  YOU SAW IT THE OTHER DAY WITH  THE TRUCK, SCREAMING OUT THE  WINDOW. YOU HEARD WHAT HE WAS SCREAMING OUT THE WINDOW.  YOU SAW IT IN SAN BERNARDINO.  YOU SAW IT AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.  YOU SAW IN ORLAND-- HOW   RRIBLE WAS THAT?  YOU SAW IT IN PARIS.  YOU SEE IT ALL OVER.  AND HILLARY IS A WEAK PERSON.  WE ARE THE LAW AND ORDER  CANDIDATES, AND WITH THE LAW AND  ORDER PARTY, WE ARE GOING TO  CHANGE THINGS AROUND.  THERE IS GOING TO BE RESPECT AGAIN FOR LAW AND ORDER.   HILLARY CLINTON'S FOREIGN POLICY HELPED LAUNCH ISIS. I SEE THE ADS SHE PUTS ON.  IF I MAKE ONE STATEMENT -- WHICH  IS FINE -- SHE WILL TAKE THAT  STATEMENT AND PUT ON A TOTALLY  DISHONEST -- BECAUSE SHE HAS A  LOT OF MONEY, BECAUSE IT IS GIVEN TO HER BY THE  LOBBYISTS AND THE SPECIAL  INTEREST. BUT I SEE THE ADS ON FOREIGN POLICY, SHE IS TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE  FOREIGN-POLICY EXPERIENCE.  OF COURSE NOT.  I HAVE BEEN A VERY, VERY  SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS PERSON, BUT  IF YOU LOOK AT MY CALLS, I SAID  DO NOT GO INTO IRAQ.  NOBODY CARED BECAUSE I WAS A BUSINESS PERSON, A CIVILIAN. TAKE THE OIL -- MANY CALLS I HAVE MADE. I SAID THAT IN SCOTLAND AND IN  THE U.K., THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.  I WAS THE ONE THAT PREDICTED IT.  AND EVERYBODY SAID, HE IS WRONG.  HE IS WRONG. PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID, IF THAT  HAPPENS, THEY WILL GET TO THE  BACK OF THE LINE, WHICH IS  PROBABLY WHY THEY LOST.  OF COURSE, I CONSIDER IT A WIN. I CONSIDER IT A WIN FOR THEM, ACTUALLY, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT  WANT TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO. AND THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE TOLD, WHEN PEOPLE POUR INTO THE  COUNTRY, TO HAVE TO TAKE THEM  EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT QUALIFIED,  EVEN IF THEY DO NOT HAVE  PAPERWORK, EVEN IF THEY HAVE NO  IDEA WHERE THEY COME FROM.  I SAID THAT BREXIT IS GOING TO  HAPPEN, I SAID THEY ARE GOING TO  BREAK AWAY, AND EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT ME.  THE ODDS WERE 20%.  THEN WHEN IT HAPPENED, SHE TOOK  AN AD, SAYING, OH, DONALD TRUMP  SAID THIS OR THAT, BUT I AM THE  ONE WHO SAID THAT WAS GOING TO  HAPPEN.  SOME OF THE MORE FAIR REPORTERS,  ABOUT 30% OF THEM, SAID HE WAS RIGHT.  I APPRECIATE THAT. 70% DID NOT, BUT I WILL BE OK. SO MIKE PENCE WILL NEVER BE  AFRAID TO SPEAK THE NAME OF OUR ENEMY -- SO IMPORTANT.  NOW I THINK, IF YOU LOOK AT ONE  OF THE BIG REASONS THAT I CHOSE  MIKE, AND ONE OF THE REASONS IS  PART OF UNITY, I HAVE TO BE HONEST.  SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID ""PARTY  UNITY,"" BECAUSE I AM AN OUTSIDER.  I WANT TO BE AN OUTSIDER. I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS I WON IN A LANDSLIDE. I WON IN A LANDSLIDE. THIS WAS NOT CLOSE. THIS WAS NOT CLOSE.   MR. TRUMP: THIS WAS NOT CLOSE. THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WITH 17 PEOPLE RUNNING, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, OTHER PEOPLE RAN AGAINST 1, 2, AND 3, WITH 17, WE GOT -- I SAY ""WE""  BECAUSE I AM A MESSENGER -- WE  GOT ALMOST 14 MILLION VOTES,  MORE THAN ANY OTHER PERSON IN  THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE PRIMARY SYSTEM  RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.  THINK OF IT. THAT IS MORE THAN RONALD REAGAN,  WHO WE LOVE. THAT IS MORE THAN MORE THAN  RICHARD NIXON, MORE THAN DWIGHT  D. EISENHOWER.  YOU KNOW, HE WON THE SECOND WORLD WAR, IN ALL FAIRNESS. MORE THAN THE BUSHES, BUT I MEAN  BY A LOT. BUT THAT IS WITH 17 PEOPLE.  THAT MEANS OUR MESSAGE IS UNBELIEVABLE. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE LOYAL  PEOPLE, BECAUSE I HAVE SUCH  LOYAL, UNBELIEVABLE PEOPLE, AND  THEY DISPLAYED THAT JUST  YESTERDAY IN CLEVELAND, WHERE  WHAT IS GOING TO BE SO AMAZING. BUT THEY DISPLAYED IT. IT WAS ON DISPLAY, WHERE WE HAD THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM I HAVE KNOWN, AND I WILL NOT SAY BECAUSE FOR PARTY UNITY, I WILL SAY THEY ARE WONDERFUL PEOPLE. ""NEVER TRUMP."" THEY SAID. ""NEVER TRUMP."" ""NEVER TRUMP."" THEY GOT CRUSHED, AND THEY GOT  CRUSHED IMMEDIATELY, BECAUSE  PEOPLE WANT WHAT WE ARE SAYING  TO HAPPEN.  THEY ARE TIRED OF A COUNTRY THAT  HAS HORRIBLE TRADE DEALS, THAT  HAS NO BORDERS, THAT HAS TAXES  THAT ARE THROUGH THE ROOF -- HIGHEST TAXED NATION, JUST  ABOUT, IN THE WORLD -- THAT HAS  REGULATIONS THAT DO NOT ALLOW  YOU TO START A BUSINESS AND  DESTROY YOUR BUSINESS IF YOU DO  START.  BY THE WAY, SPEAKING OF  DESTROYING BUSINESSES, WE ARE  GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THE MINERS AND THE STEELWORKERS. WE ARE GOING TO PUT THEM BACK TO  WORK.   SO THEY ARE TIRED OF  IT.  BUT I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THOSE  PEOPLE, THE DELEGATES ON THE  DIFFERENT COMMITTEES BECAUSE  BOY, WAS THAT SOMETHING?  UNFORTUNATELY, THE VOTE WAS VERY  LATE, BUT ESSENTIALLY WE HAD 112 -- THIS WAS THE VOTE THAT WAS  GOING TO PUT IT ON THE FLOOR AND  WE WOULD HAVE A BIG FIGHT -- WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A  FIGHT. PEOPLE AGREE. THEY WANT THE WALL, THEY WANT  THE BORDERS, THEY WANT THESE  THINGS TO HAPPEN.   AND WHAT WE ARE DOING  THAT I'M SO PROUD OF, AND NOBODY ELSE WOULD EVEN THINK ABOUT DOING, I HAVE FOUGHT VERY HARD  FOR IT.  WE WILL CALL IT THE ""JOHNSON AMENDMENT,"" WHERE HE TOOK AWAY FROM THE EVANGELICALS -- AND I WANT TO THANK THE EVANGELICALS, BECAUSE WITHOUT THE EVANGELICALS  I COULD NOT HAVE WON THIS , NOMINATION.  THE EVANGELICALS HAVE BEEN  UNBELIEVABLE. I DOMINATED WITH THE EVANGELICALS. A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED.  THEY SAY HE IS NOT PERFECT, BUT  YOU KNOW WHAT?  THEY KNOW I'M GOING TO GET THE  JOB DONE, AND THEY ARE REALLY SMART.   AND I SAID, FOR THE  EVANGELICALS, THAT WE ARE GOING  TO DO SOMETHING THAT NOBODY HAS  EVEN TRIED TO DO.  YOU HAVE THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT  PASSED BY LYNDON JOHNSON AND HIS  GROUP. HE WAS A POWERFUL PRESIDENT WHO  KNEW HOW TO GET THINGS DONE. HE GOT BOGGED DOWN IN A WAR THAT  DESTROYED HIM.  BUT HE WAS A POWERFUL PRESIDENT,  AND WE CALL IT THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT.  WHERE YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY SHUNNED  IF YOU ARE EVANGELICAL, IF YOU  WANT TO TALK RELIGION YOU LOSE , YOUR TAX-EXEMPT STATUS. WE PUT, INTO THE PLATFORM, WE  ARE GOING TO GET RID OF THAT  HORRIBLE JOHNSON AMENDMENT.   WE ARE GOING TO LET EVANGELICALS, WE ARE GOING TO LET CHRISTIANS AND JEWS AND  PEOPLE OF RELIGION TALK WITHOUT  BEING AFRAID TO TALK. I SAW THIS -- I HAD SO MANY GREAT LEADERS, SO MANY TIMES, UP TO MY OFFICE.  THE ABSOLUTE TOP EVANGELICAL  LEADERS, CHRISTIAN LEADERS,  JEWISH LEADERS.  BELIEVE IT OR NOT, SOME MUSLIM LEADERS.  PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SURPRISED  TO HEAR THAT.  I HAD THE TOP LEADERS UP TO MY  OFFICE AND I SAID, WHY IS IT  THAT YOU ARE SO POWERFUL AS AN  INDIVIDUAL, AND YET, WHEN YOU  GET OUT THERE, YOU ARE SORT OF  TIMID?  THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO ANSWER  THE QUESTION.  IT TOOK TWO OR THREE MEETINGS  BEFORE I FIGURED IT OUT.  ONE GREAT, GREAT GENTLEMAN THAT  EVERYBODY KNOWS, BUT WHOSE NAME  I WILL NOT REVEAL, SAID, MR.  TRUMP, WE LIVE IN FEAR IN OUR  CHURCHES AND SYNAGOGUES.  WE LIVE IN FEAR THAT WE ARE  GOING TO LOSE OUR TAX-EXEMPT  STATUS IF WE SAY ANYTHING THAT  IS EVEN SLIGHTLY POLITICAL.  AND I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW, I  WAS IN TRUMP TOWER, AND POINTED  TO PEOPLE WALKING DOWN THE  STREET. I SAID, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SPEAK, AND YOU DON'T.  THAT MEANS THEY ARE MORE  POWERFUL THAN YOU ARE.  WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT  IT. HOW DID IT START?  HOW DID IT START? AND THEY SAID IT STARTED BECAUSE OF LYNDON JOHNSON. AND HE ACTUALLY HAD A PROBLEM IN TEXAS WITH A CERTAIN RELIGIOUS  LEADER AND HE DID THIS AND GOT IT DONE, AND WE ARE GOING TO  UNDO IT, SO THAT RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN THIS COUNTRY, AND  THOSE UNBELIEVABLE PEOPLE -- AND NOT BECAUSE THEY BACKED ME IN SUCH LARGE NUMBERS -- BUT SO THAT RELIGION CAN AGAIN HAVE A VOICE.  BECAUSE RELIGION'S VOICE HAS  BEEN TAKEN AWAY, AND WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THAT.   ALL RIGHT. BACK TO MIKE PENCE. SO, ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS I  CHOSE MIKE WAS, I LOOKED AT  INDIANA -- AND I WON INDIANA BIG. REMEMBER, INDIANA WAS GOING TO  BE THE FIREWALL -- THAT IS WHERE  TRUMP WAS GOING DOWN. THE AGREED I WOULD WIN  PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW YORK AND  ALL THESE PLACES. BUT INDIANA WAS GOING TO BE THE  FIREWALL, SO I GOT TO STUDY  INDIANA AND I GOT TO STUDY NEW  YORK AND A LOT OF OTHER PLACES,  AND I SAW HOW NAFTA, SIGNED BY  BILL CLINTON, HAS DRAINED OUR  MANUFACTURING JOBS.  DRAINED US LIKE WE HAVE NEVER  BEEN DRAINED BEFORE.  NAFTA, AGAIN, SIGNED BY BILL CLINTON.  NAFTA IS THE WORST ECONOMIC DEAL  IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. MANUFACTURING DOWN IN SOME  STATES 65%.  IT IS A HORROR SHOW.  MOVING TO MEXICO, MOVING TO  OTHER PLACES. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS A GREAT BUILDER.  WHAT HE BUILDS HIS PLANS. HE DOES NOT BUILD BUILDINGS, HE BUILDS PLANS, THE BIGGEST IN THE WORLD FROM WHAT I HEAR. I SAID, HOW IS BUSINESS?  I WAS WITH HIM THE OTHER DAY.  HOW IS BUSINESS? HE GOES, UNBELIEVABLE. I SAID REALLY, WOW, I AM  SURPRISED. WHY IS IT UNBELIEVABLE? BECAUSE I THINK OF HIM AS  BUILDING IN THIS COUNTRY.  HE SAID, DONALD, WHAT WE ARE  DOING IN MEXICO, YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE.  HE SAID WE ARE BUILDING PLANTS  IN MEXICO THE LIKES OF WHICH WE  HAVE NEVER SEEN. I SAID WHAT ABOUT THIS COUNTRY? ""NOT MUCH,"" THAT WAS THE EXPRESSION.  HE SAID EXACTLY THAT. ""NOT MUCH."" I SAID BUT MEXICO? HE SAID, YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN  ANYTHING LIKE IT.  IT IS INCREDIBLE. FOLKS, THAT IS GOING TO STOP. WE ARE GOING TO REVERSE IT.  WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR JOBS  BACK TO OUR COUNTRY. WE CANNOT BE WITH STUPID PEOPLE ANYMORE. AND HE WAS BETTER THAN A  POLLSTER, BETTER THAN A CONSULTANT TO I WOULD SAY HOW  ARE WE DOING, AND YOU GET A  REPORT THAT COSTS YOU MILLIONS  OF DOLLARS. THAT DOES NOT COST ME MILLIONS. ME, I GIVE THEM $10,000.   FOUR OTHER PEOPLE, MILLIONS. -- FOR OTHER PEOPLE, MILLIONS.  IT COSTS OTHER CAMPAIGNS  MILLION. A GUY LIKE THIS IS BETTER THAN ANYBODY YOU CAN HIRE TO DO A  REPORT, AND HE DID NOT SAY IT  FROM THE STANDPOINT OF HE IS  UPSET ABOUT IT, JUST FACT. ""HOW ARE WE DOING?"" ""UNBELIEVABLE IN MEXICO.""  IN FACT, HE ACTUALLY SAID ""I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE  IT."" AND IF YOU LOOK, FORD IS  BUILDING MASSIVE PLANTS THERE  INSTEAD OF IN MICHIGAN. AND WE WANT THEM TO BUILD IN MICHIGAN.  AND YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW HOW TO  DO THAT, SO EASY. SO EASY.  BUT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DO AND  THEY ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE  ADVANTAGE OF US WITHOUT RETRIBUTION. THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES WHEN YOU  FIRE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY AND THINK YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE YOUR  PRODUCT AND SELL IN HERE. THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES.  AND THOSE CONSEQUENCES ARE GOING  TO KEEP COMPANIES IN OUR COUNTRY.  EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT THE  CONSEQUENCES ARE, BUT I WILL NOT  SAY THAT BECAUSE I AM MUCH MORE  INTERESTED RIGHT NOW IN MIKE.  INDIANA'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE -- AND THIS WAS THE PRIMARY REASON  I WANTED MIKE, OTHER THAN HE  LOOKS VERY GOOD, OTHER THAN HE  HAS AN INCREDIBLE FAMILY, INCREDIBLE WIFE AND FAMILY -- KAREN IS AMAZING.   INCREDIBLE FAMILY. HIGHLY RESPECTED. EXPECTED TO GO FOR ANOTHER FOUR  YEARS. HE WOULD HAVE A WON, I THINK  VERY EASILY IN INDIANA. ,INDIANA, THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT  RATE HAS FALLEN, WHEN HE WAS  THERE, WHEN HE STARTED 8.4% WHEN , HE WAS GOVERNOR TO LESS THAN  5% IN MAY OF 2016. SINCE JANUARY 2013, INDIANA'S  LABOR FORCE HAS INCREASED BY  MORE THAN 186,000 JOBS.  YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.  I HAVE GONE AROUND TO ALL OF  THESE THINGS. TO ALL OF THEM.  EVERY TIME I HAVE STATISTICIANS, I SAY GIVE ME THE STATS ON THIS  STATE, AND IT IS ALWAYS BAD.  DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.  DOWN 40%, 50%, 60% IN SOME CASES. HERE'S SOMEBODY WHERE IT HAS  GONE UP.  PRIVATE-SECTOR JOB GROWTH IS UP  BY MORE THAN 147,000 JOBS SINCE 2013. THAT IS, LIKE VERY UNUSUAL. , GOVERNOR PENCE BALANCED THE BUDGET.  CAN YOU IMAGINE A BALANCED BUDGET? OUR BUDGET IS SO OUT OF WHACK. HE BALANCED THE BUDGET.  THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.  GOVERNOR PENCE BALANCED THE  BUDGET, PRODUCED A SURPLUS, AND  MAINTAINS A $2 BILLION RESERVE  FUND.  IT IS ALSO RATED AAA, THEIR BONDS. AAA. VERY FEW STATES HAVE THAT, AAA.  THE BEST. THAT IS AS GOOD AS YOU CAN GET,  WHETHER YOU ARE A COMPANY OR A  STATE. AAA. INDIANA WAS RECENTLY RECOGNIZED  BY ""CHIEF EXECUTIVE"" MAGAZINE AS  THE NUMBER ONE STATE IN THE  MIDWEST FOR BUSINESS, NUMBER ONE.  AND IT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE.  THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 34,000  FEWER HOOSIERS ON UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE NOW THAN THERE WERE  WHEN MIKE PENCE TOOK OFFICE.  SO YOU HAVE FEWER HOOSIERS,  FEWER PEOPLE FROM INDIANA. BESIDES THAT, BOBBY KNIGHT, MY  FRIEND, WHO REALLY DID HELP ME.  IF YOU WANT A REFERENCE, BOBBY  KNIGHT IN INDIANA, WE LOVE BOBBY KNIGHT. HE AGREES WITH EVERYTHING I AM  SAYING.  HE LOVES THE GOVERNOR.  INDIANA HAS THE SECOND LOWEST  UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE NATION  FOR VETERANS, WHERE NOBODY IS  FIGHTING FOR THE VETERANS LIKE I  AM FIGHTING FOR THE VETERANS. THE VETERANS HAVE BEEN LEFT  BEHIND.   IF YOU REMEMBER A FEW  MONTHS AGO, HILLARY CLINTON SAID REALLY, THEY ARE DOING MUCH  BETTER, THE V.A. IS DOING MUCH  BETTER.  THEY ARE DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB  THAN PEOPLE GIVE IT CREDIT FOR.  PEOPLE ARE DYING IN LINE,  WAITING FIVE OR SIX DAYS FOR DOCTORS.  THEY CANNOT EVEN SEE A DOCTOR. IT IS A SCANDAL. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING  WITH THE V.A. IN ARIZONA.  JUST THE VETERANS  ADMINISTRATION, IT IS A SCANDAL.  IT IS CORRUPT, IT IS  INCOMPETENT, IT IS A SCANDAL.  AND HILLARY CLINTON THOUGHT IT  WAS JUST FINE.  AND, BOY, AM I GOING TO WIN BIG  WITH THE VETERANS.  WE KNOW THAT FOR A FACT.   SO IT IS NOW 2.4% FOR  VETERANS, IN 2013 WHEN MIKE PENCE TOOK OFFICE, THE RATE FOR  VETERANS WAS 6.7%. IT WAS FIRST IN THE NATION, ONE  OF THE BAD ONES. NOW IT IS THE BEST. GOT THEM JOBS. INDIANAPOLIS IS RANKED SECOND IN  TOP 10 METRO AREAS FOR YOUNG  COLLEGE GRADUATES.  THAT IS A GREAT THING.  THEY WILL STAY THERE.  THAT IS A GREAT THING.  AND MIKE WORKED HARD ON THAT.  HE WAS TELLING ME THAT WAS NOT  EASY.  UNDER GOVERNOR PENCE'S LEADERSHIP, INDIANA ENACTED THE BIGGEST K-12 FUNDING INCREASE IN  HISTORY.  SO YOU ARE BALANCING THE BUDGET AND GIVING MORE MONEY TO  EDUCATION. ISN'T THAT A GREAT THING?   INDIANA HAS JUST ABOUT THE LARGEST SCHOOL CHOICE PROGRAM IN AMERICA. SCHOOL CHOICE IS WHERE IT IS AT. IF YOU WANT TO GET YOUR SCHOOLS BETTER, YOU HAVE GOT TO GET RID OF COMMON CORE, FAST.  GOVERNOR PENCE ENACTED THE  LARGEST INCOME TAX CUT IN THE STATE'S HISTORY.  THINK ABOUT THAT. CUTTING TAXES AND BALANCING THE  BUDGET. AND ALONG WITH CORPORATE TAX  REFORM, JUST ABOUT NUMBER ONE IN  THE COUNTRY.  CNBC RANKED INDIANA FIRST IN THE  NATION FOR ITS INFRASTRUCTURE.  SO WITH ALL OF THESE CUTS AND  ALL OF THESE BALANCING BUDGETS, WE ARE SPENDING MORE MONEY ON  EDUCATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE IS  KEPT UP.  THAT HAD SO MUCH -- LOOK, AS A  BUILDER, NOBODY IN THE HISTORY  OF THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER KNOWN  SO MUCH ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE AS  DONALD TRUMP.  I BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE. DO I KNOW HOW TO BUILD A WALL?  DO I KNOW HOW TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE.  IT IS VERY INTERESTING.  WE ARE BUILDING -- I WON -- WHAT IS AMAZING IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION -- I WON THE  RIGHT TO HAVE THE OLD POST OFFICE BUILDING ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, RIGHT BY THE WHITE HOUSE.  IT IS AMAZING, PROBABLY THE BEST  LOCATION, ONE OF THE MOST SOUGHT  AFTER PROJECTS BY THE GSA  GENERAL SERVICE.  I LIKE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN . IVANKA AND ERIC AND DON DID A  GREAT JOB ON IT.  AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN  OPENING VERY SOON. I THOUGHT THE OTHER DAY I WAS  GOING OVER THE NUMBERS, WE ARE  UNDER BUDGET AND ABOUT A YEAR,  ACTUALLY MORE THAN A YEAR, WE  ARE A YEAR AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND  UNDER BUDGET SUBSTANTIALLY, AND  THE QUALITY OF THE WORK IS EVEN  BETTER THAN WE WERE ORIGINALLY  GOING TO DO.   WHEN I EXPLAINED TO A GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE THAT WE ARE UNDER BUDGET AND AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, THEY ALMOST FELL OFF, BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD THOSE WORDS BEFORE.  SO WHEN I SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO  INDIANA, WHICH WAS HAVING TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS, WHEN I SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO INDIANA UNDER MIKE'S WORK, AND HIS PREDECESSOR  DID A GREAT JOB, BY THE WAY, WHO  IS NOW AT PURDUE, WHO IS NOW PURDUE, WHEN I SEE WHAT HAPPENED  WITH RESPECT TO THE NUMBERS, THE STATE, AND EVERYTHING ELSE, THAT, TO ME, WAS PROBABLY THE  SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ONE.  BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED, ALMOST HAS NOT HAPPENED, IN THIS WHOLE COUNTRY. THE TURNAROUND AND STRENGTH OF  INDIANA HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE, AND  I LEARNED THAT WHEN I CAMPAIGNED THERE, AND I LEARNED THAT WHEN I  WON THAT STATE IN A LANDSLIDE,  AND I LEARNED THAT WHEN GOVERNOR  PENCE, UNDER TREMENDOUS PRESSURE  FROM ESTABLISHMENT PEOPLE,  ENDORSED SOMEBODY ELSE -- BUT IT  WAS MORE OF AN ENDORSEMENT FOR  ME, IF YOU REMEMBER.  HE TALKED ABOUT TRUMP, AND THEN  HE TALKED ABOUT TED -- WHO IS A GOOD GUY, BY THE WAY, WHO IS  GOING TO BE SPEAKING AT THE CONVENTION -- TED CRUZ, GOOD  GUY.  BUT HE TALKED ABOUT TED AND THEN  DROP, AND THEN BACK TO TED. SO WHO DID HE ENDORSE? SO EVEN THOUGH HE WAS UNDER PRESSURE, SOMEONE OUTSIDE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT, IT WAS THE SINGLE GREATEST NON-ENDORSEMENT I HAVE EVER HAD.   SO WITH THAT, I WOULD  LIKE TO INTRODUCE A MAN WHO I TRULY BELIEVE WILL BE OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY AND  WILL BE THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE. THANK YOU.  THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. ",Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Vice Presidential Selection Introduction

WOW, LOOK AT THIS ROOM. BEAUTIFUL, WOW. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. SO NICE. I LOVE OHIO. YOU KNOW, I WORKED IN OHIO FOR A LONG TIME. RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD. SWIFTON VILLAGE, GREAT PLACE. I CAME HERE WITH MY FATHER. WE BOUGHT IT. WE FIXED IT. WE MADE IT BEAUTIFUL. WE SOLD IT. MADE A LOT OF MONEY. THEN AFTER WE LEFT, IT WENT DOWN THE TUBES. BUT THAT CAN HAPPEN. IT WENT DOWN THE TUBES. BUT WE DID GREAT. IT WAS ONE OF MY EARLY REAL ESTATE DEALS AND IT GAVE ME A LOT OF CONFIDENCE. SO I CAN SAY THAT CINCINNATI AND OHIO GAVE ME A LOT OF CONFIDENCE, AND HERE I AM. HERE I AM.   I WILL SAY HE ENDORSED ME AND IT'S BEEN ELECTRIC BUT ROB PORTMAN HAS REALLY BEEN GOOD TO ME AND I APPRECIATE IT. AND THE SENATOR'S GOT TO RUN AGAINST TED STRICKLAND WHO HAS NOT DONE A GOOD JOB FOR OHIO. I WILL SAY THAT. HE HAS NOT DONE A GOOD JOB FOR OHIO. SO YOU'RE GOING DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO COME NOVEMBER. AND AS FAR AS DONALD TRUMP IS CONCERNED, I'M GOING TO BE BACK HERE MANY, MANY, MANY TIMES, OK?   I'M GOING TO BE BACK HERE SO MUCH, YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO SICK OF ME. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, DON'T LET HIM COME BACK ANYMORE. NO, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN OHIO. WE'RE DOING REALLY WELL RIGHT NOW. WE HAVEN'T STARTED. THEY WERE SAYING BECAUSE I FINANCED MY PRIMARY CAMPAIGNS, OVER $50 MILLION. I OWN MONEY. SO FAR WE'RE DOING WELL THOUGH, RIGHT? HAVE I BEEN A GOOD MESSENGER? WE HAVE A MOVEMENT. YOU KNOW WHAT NEW TO SAID -- YOU KNOW WHAT NEWT SAID, WE HAVE A MOVEMENT GOING. THIS IS A MOVEMENT LIKE PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. THIS WAS SET UP RECENTLY. LOOK AT THIS PLACE. AND BY THE WAY, JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND, I SAY THIS FOR THE PRESS, NOT FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO CARE. BUT WE HAVE A 2,000-ROOM OVERFLOW OVER HERE OR OVER THERE. SO AND WE'RE ON THAT CAMERA. SO THE PEOPLE IN THE OVERFLOW ROOM, I LOVE YOU JUST AS MUCH AS THESE PEOPLE. THEY JUST ARE BETTER AT REAL ESTATE, RIGHT? AND WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE TRYING TO GET IN. AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS WHEN WE'RE FINISHED HERE, WE'RE GOING TO COME OVER AND SAY HELLO TO THE PEOPLE IN THE OVERFLOW ROOM, RIGHT? WE'LL COME OVER AND SEE YOU FOR A LITTLE WHILE. WE HAVE ALL THE TIME WE WANT. WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS THE RIGHT WAY AND WE HAVE ALL THE TIME WE WANT. BUT I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU, ALL OF THE OVERFLOW AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE. WE PUT SPEAKERS OUTSIDE FOR THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE. WE HAVE TREMENDOUS CROWDS NO MATTER WHERE WE GO. IT'S A MOVEMENT. NO MATTER WHERE WE GO, WE HAVE CROWDS LIKE NOBODY'S EVER SEEN BEFORE. THE BIGGEST CROWDS. THANK YOU TOO, DARLING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.   AND I JUST HEARD THE NEWS BECAUSE IT JUST HAPPENED, AS YOU KNOW. WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES SAYING NO PROBLEM. NO PROBLEM. NO PROBLEM.   YOU KNOW, I WROTE OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT CROOKED HILLARY, SO CROOKED. SHE MADE SO MANY FALSE STATEMENTS. IS SHE GOING TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE CONGRESS OR IS SOMETHING GOING TO HAPPEN? IS SOMETHING GOING TO HAPPEN? BECAUSE IT'S A DISGRACE. HILLARY CLINTON CLAIMED THAT THE REASON FOR HER ILLEGAL USE OF A PRIVATE, INSECURE E-MAIL, RIGHT, SHE CLAIMED THIS, WAS THAT IT WAS MORE CONVENIENT TO USE JUST ONE DEVICE. OH.   THE FACT IS THE FBI DIRECTOR SAID HILLARY USED SEVERAL DIFFERENT SERVERS EVEN THOUGH SHE SAID IT WAS ONE AND NUMEROUS MOBILE DEVICES TO SEND AND READ E-MAILS. IN OTHER WORDS, HILLARY'S SECRET E-MAIL SERVER EXISTED FOR THE REASON WE ALL KNOW, TO KEEP HER E MAILS FROM EVER BEING READ BY THE PUBLIC. HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH JUST WANTING TO USE ONE DEVICE. OK, WE UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE SAID. SHE SAID SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT UNDER OATH. SHE SAID SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT TO EVERYBODY. NO, BUT THE WAY, AND HOW ABOUT THE 33,000 E-MAILS THAT WERE WIPED OUT? 33,000. HOW CAN YOU DO 33,000 E-MAILS? AND IT WAS WIPED OUT. IN HER TESTIMONY TO CONGRESS, HILLARY CLINTON SAID SHE TURNED OVER ALL OF HER RELATED E-MAILS, SHE SAID THAT. I SAW THAT.   THE FBI DIRECTOR SAID HILLARY FAILED TO TURN OVER SEVERAL THOUSAND WORK-RELATED E-MAILS INCLUDING E-MAILS THAT WERE CLASSIFIED. RIGHT. RIGGED SYSTEM, FOLKS. REMEMBER I USED TO SAY IT. I'M THE ONE THAT BROUGHT THAT WORD UP. NOW EVERYBODY'S USING IT. BERNIE SANDERS IS RIGHTFULLY USING IT. BECAUSE HONESTLY, WHAT THEY DID WITH HIM WAS NOT GOOD. NOT GOOD. NOW WE HAVE FALSE STATEMENT NUMBER THREE. THERE ARE MANY. I JUST DON'T WANT TO BORE YOU WITH TOO MANY OF THESE. IN HER TESTIMONY TO CONGRESS, HILLARY CLINTON SAID THERE WAS NOTHING MARKED CLASSIFIED ON MY E-MAILS EITHER SENT OR RECEIVED. RIGHT? SHE SAID THAT. I HEARD IT, YOU HEARD IT. WE ALL HEARD IT. THE FBI DIRECTOR SAID HILLARY HAD SENT OR RECEIVED MORE THAN 100 E-MAILS WITH CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. INCLUDING E-MAILS WITH CONFIDENTIAL SECRET AND TOP SECRET INFORMATION. RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID. BUT SHE DIDN'T SAY THAT. BENGHAZI ALSO. HILLARY SAID FACT NUMBER FOUR. THESE ARE ALL LIES. WE SAY LIE, LIE, LIE. LIE. DIRTY ROTTEN LIAR, RIGHT? HILLARY SAID HER PRIVATE SERVER -- THAT'S WHAT IT IS. AND YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING, FOLKS. I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE SET STRAIGHT? IN NOVEMBER, YOU'RE GOING TO GET OUT AND VOTE.   WHEN YOU LOOK AT TERRORISM, WHEN YOU LOOK AT HER DECISIONS, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT SHE HAS GOT SUCH BAD DECISION MAKING ABILITY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GONE ON DURING OBAMA'S YEARS, LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT AND HER EXCEPT THAT I SORT OF SHAMED HER INTO IT, OK? JUST LIKE I SHAMED HER INTO NOT APPROVING TPP BUT IF SHE EVER WON, SHE WOULD APPROVE THAT SO FAST. THAT WILL DO TO YOU WORSE THAN WHAT NAFTA DID TO YOU, OK? BUT SHE HAS GOT BAD JUDGMENT. AND YOU KNOW WHO SAID THAT? BERNIE SANDERS. THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS BAD JUDGMENT. AND NUMBER ONE, IT'S ILLEGAL WHAT SHE DID HERE, BUT IT'S ALSO BAD JUDGMENT. WHAT DID SHE DO IT FOR? SHE KNOWS WHY. MOST OF THE PEOPLE HERE KNOW WHY. FALSE STATEMENT NUMBER FOUR. HILLARY SAID HER PRIVATE SERVER WAS SECURE WITH NUMEROUS SAFEGUARDS. THEY HAD NO SECURITY BREACHES. NO SECURITY BREACHES. NOW THEY'RE SAYING EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW, DOES ANYBODY HAVE HER INFORMATION? YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING, I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ONCE AN E-MAIL GETS SENT, IT'S ALWAYS OUT. YOU CAN REALLY NEVER WIPE IT OUT. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S LOOKED TOO HARD BECAUSE WHEN YOU WIPE OUT 30,000 E-MAILS, I HEAR 33,000 ACTUALLY, I HEAR TWO NUMBERS, 30,000 AND 33,000, PICK YOUR CHOICE. WHAT DIFFERENCE? WHEN YOU WIPE OUT 30,000 E-MAILS -- 30,000. NOW, I'VE ALWAYS HEARD LIKE IF YOU ARE IN LITIGATION, EVERYTHING ELSE, THERE'S NO WAY OF REALLY EXPUNKING THOSE -- REALLY EXPUNGING THOSE E-MAILS. THEY'RE ALWAYS WITH YOU IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE LOOKING. THERE ARE PROBABLY A COUPLE OF SUPER GENIUSES IN THIS ROOM THAT PROBABLY WOULD KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO FIND THOSE 30,000 E-MAILS. I DON'T THINK THEY LOOKED TOO HARD. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO ANYBODY BE? I'VE ALWAYS HEARD YOU CAN FIND. YOU CAN'T GET RID OF THEM. THE FBI DIRECTOR SAID IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HOSTILE ACTORS GAINED ACCESS TO HILLARY'S PERSONAL E-MAIL ACCOUNT AND SAID SHE USED A SECURE AND THINK OF IT THIS SHE USED HER INSECURE E-MAIL ACCOUNT AND E-MAILED WHILE TRAVELING ABROAD IN TERRITORY OF SOPHISTICATED AND THESE ARE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED ADVERSARIES. THE FBI DIRECTOR ALSO SAID HACK ERS SUCCESSFULLY BREACHED THE E-MAIL ACCOUNTS OF HILLARY'S FRIENDS. OK? THEY BREACHEDED TO FRIENDS. SOME FRIENDS. OUR ENEMIES LIKELY HAVE A BLACKMAIL FILE ON HER WHICH ACTUALLY SHOULD DISQUALIFY HER FOR EVEN RUNNING FOR OFFICE. RIGHT?   YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, RIGHT? AND THEN IN HER TESTIMONY TO CONGRESS, HILLARY CLINTON SAID HER ATTORNEYS CONDUCTED A RIGOROUS REVIEW OF HER E-MAILS AND SAID THEY WENT THROUGH EVERY SINGLE E-MAIL. BUT THE FACT IS, THE FBI DIRECTOR SAID, THE LAWYERS DOING THE SORTING FOR SECRETARY CLINTON IN 2014 DID NOT INDIVIDUALLY READ THE CONTENT OF ALL OF HER E-MAILS BEFORE DESTROYING THEM. WHAT'S GOING ON, FOLKS? WHAT'S GOING ON? I MEAN, IT'S -- IT'S VERY SAD. YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY SAD. MORE. MORE. IT'S MORE, BUT YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A CROOKED SYSTEM. WE HAVE A RIGGED SYSTEM. WE HAVE A DISHONEST PRESS. LET ME TELL YOU, I WAS IN NORTH CAROLINA LAST NIGHT. I HAVE TO SAY BECAUSE I JUST LOVE DOING IT. THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU TOO, MAN. IT'S A GUY BUT I LOVE HIM. I LOVE EVERYBODY HERE. I DON'T CARE. I DON'T CARE. BUT WE HAVE A RIGGED SYSTEM. WE HAVE A CROOKED SYSTEM. I MEAN, WE HAVE A CROOKED SYSTEM. BUT TALK ABOUT THE PRESS, OK? I LOVE TALKING ABOUT HOW DISHONEST THEY ARE. IF YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN, YOU'RE A CONSERVATIVE. I'VE HEARD IT FOR YEARS BUT HAD NO IDEA. WHEN I WAS RUNNING AND BING, BING, BING, KNOCKING OUT ONE AFTER OTHER. AM I DOING A GOOD JOB FOR YOU, FOLKS? I'M KNOCKING OUT ONE AFTER ANOTHER. SO WHEN I'M OUT RUNNING, AND IT WAS BAD. I THOUGHT IT WAS UNFAIR, BUT YOU KNOW, THEY HAD 17 PEOPLE THAT BASICALLY THEY DO NOT LIKE TOO MUCH. ME THEY LIKED THE LEAST BY FAR. IT HIT YOU. BUT NOW IT'S ALL TOWARD ME. AND I WATCH AND SAY THINGS LIKE THERE'S A GUY ON ""MEET THE PRESS"" CALLED SLEEPY EYES CHUCK TODD.   THE GUY WAS DYING ON ""MEET THE PRESS"" A YEAR AGO, AWHILE AGO. HE WAS DYING. NOBODY WATCHING ""MEET THE PRESS."" THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT TAKING HIM OFF. NEVER TREATED MEED FAIRLY. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED WAS HE CALLED ME AND HE WANTED ME TO DO AN INTERVIEW. AND I DID IT. AND IT WAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATED INTERVIEWS IN THE -- IN THE HISTORY OF ""MEET THE PRESS."" BUT THESE ARE DISLOYAL PEOPLE. SO AFTER ABOUT TWO DAYS, HE FORGOT ABOUT IT. AND THEN HE DID A LITTLE BIT MORE. ""MEET THE PRESS"" IS FINE RIGHT NOW. I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANY MORE INTERVIEWS WITH THEM SO I WATCHED LIKE YESTERDAY AND I MADE THE STATEMENT SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT, I WAS TALKING ABOUT TERRORISM. AND I SAID, SADDAM HUSSEIN IS A BAD MAN. YOU HEARD THIS. RIGHT? RIGHT? YOU HEARD THIS. HE'S A BAD MAN. NOW, THEY WANTED ME TO TALK LESS AND I SPOKE FOR 106 MINUTES. A LONG TIME. A LONG TIME WITHOUT NOTES, WITHOUT PAPERS, WITHOUT ANYTHING STANDING UP IN FRONT OF FOUR OR FIVE NETWORKS THAT ARE GOING. SO I SAID LAST NIGHT, I'M NOT READING. NO TELEPROMPTERS. I DO LIKE THEM ACTUALLY. IT'S A LOT EASIER. TELEPROMPTERS. LET SOMEBODY COME UP AND DO WHAT I DO, RIGHT?  OF COURSE, I'D HAVE ABOUT 12 PEOPLE INSTEAD OF 7,000 PEOPLE.   BUT I SAID VERY SIMPLE, I SAID, SADDAM HUSSEIN IS A BAD MAN. BAD GUY. AND I SAID IT THREE OR FOUR TIMES. REALLY BAD. BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. I SAID BUT ONE THING HE'S GOOD AT, SAID THIS LAST NIGHT. THEY WANTED ME TO TALK ABOUT HILLARY FOR 106, LIKE FOR HOURS. I SAID, YOU KNOW, I WENT 15 MINUTES. I WENT A LOT OF TIME. I WROTE A WHOLE THING. SHE'S CROOKED HILLARY. SHE'S CROOKED AS HELL. THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO KNOW. NO. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.   SO BUT LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN, SO AFTER AWHILE, WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT TERRORISM, RIGHT? BECAUSE WE'LL BEAT HILLARY. IF WE BEAT HER, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE AS SHE WOULD SAY? WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE. MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE. WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? REMEMBER THE FAMOUS STATEMENT, GREEN DRESS. OK. SO GREEN DRESS, YEAH. GREEN DRESS. NO, SHE SAID GREEN PANTSUIT. SO LOOK. SO LOOK, LISTEN, SO LAST NIGHT, I SAID, AND IT WAS AN UNBELIEVABLE CROWD IN NORTH CAROLINA. STANDING OVATIONS ALL OVER THE PLACE. BUT I SAID, BAD GUY, SADDAM HUSSEIN. BAD GUY. THEN I SAID AGAIN DID, SADDAM HUSSEIN IS A BAD GUY. BUT HE DID ONE THING WELL. HE KILLED TERRORISTS. RIGHT?   THAT'S OK. JUST A QUICK STATEMENT. BUT I WANTED TO EMPHASIZE BECAUSE I KNOW IF I DIDN'T EMPHASIZE, THEY'D SAY I LIKE SADDAM HUSSEIN. SO I SAID IT. I THINK THREE TIMES. BAD, BAD, BAD. IN FACT I STARTED REPEATING MYSELF. I SAID I DON'T LIKE THAT. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY, IS THAT GUY OK? SO WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT HAPPENED, I SAID IT VERY STRONGLY, BAD PERSON. OK, NOW IT'S OVER. AND WE TALKED ABOUT TERRORISM. WE TALKED ABOUT TRADE. WE TALKED ABOUT TERMINATING OBAMACARE AND REPLACING IT WITH SOMETHING GREAT WHICH WE'RE GOING TO DO.   WE TALKED ABOUT GETTING RID OF COMMON CORE AND BRINGING OUR EDUCATION LOCALLY AND TAKING IT AWAY FROM  WE TALKED ABOUT BORDERS. WE TALKED ABOUT BUILDING A WALL, RIGHT? WE TALKED ABOUT OUR OR DEPLETED MILITARY. RIGHT? WE TALKED ABOUT OUR VERY DEPLETED MILITARY, BUILD A WALL. DON'T WORRY. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A WALL. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, OK?   WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A WALL. GOING TO BE A REAL WALL. SUCH A LOW CEILING. OH, WE'RE GOING A LOT HIGHER THAN THAT. AND EVERY TIME THEY FIGHT US ON THAT WALL, IT GETS TEN FEET HIGHER, FOLKS, BELIEVE ME. BELIEVE ME. NOW, WE'RE GOING TO STOP THE DRUGS FROM COMING IN. YOU KNOW, JUST IN CASE, JUST IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW, SO THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS, 16,500 BORDER PATROL AGENTS ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP. THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. AND THEIR JOB IS MUCH EASIER NOW THAN WHEN THEY'RE WITH ME. WHEN THEY'RE WITH ME, THEY'RE GOING TO BE WORKING HARD. RIGHT NOW THEY JUST STAND THERE AND SAY OH, GO ON THROUGH. HELLO. WELCOME TO THE COUNTRY, RIGHT. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIVES. SO IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT. ALSO SHERIFF JOE. WE LOVE SHERIFF JOE. JOE ENDORSED DONALD RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING. RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING. SO WE HAVE A SITUATION, RIGHT, WHERE WE GO ON AND WE CONTINUE TO GO ON AND WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SPEECHES AND WE CONTINUE TO WASTE TIME BECAUSE THE POLITICIANS AREN'T LISTENING. RIGHT? THEY'RE NOT LISTENING. BUT I MADE A SPEECH AND THIS SPEECH LAST NIGHT WAS GOOD. AND WHAT HAPPENED? I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND WE -- YOU HAD TO SEE THIS CROWD. THIS CROWD. THIS CROWD WAS UNBELIEVABLE, THE ENERGY. ALL THE CROWDS HAVE ENERGY. I WAKE UP AND I TURN ON THE TELEVISION. DONALD TRUMP LOVES SADDAM HUSSEIN. HE LOVES SADDAM HUSSEIN, AND I WAS JUST ASKED A QUESTION BY ""THE CINCINNATI ENQUIRER"" INSIDE. MR. TRUMP, IS IT TRUE THAT YOU LOVE SADDAM HUSSEIN? ESSENTIALLY, LIKE SORT OF THAT, YOU KNOW, AND I SAID THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID. THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID. SO THAT'S THE NARRATIVE THAT GOES AROUND. I ACTUALLY PUT A PRESS RELEASE OUT, AND NOW THE PEOPLE THAT SAW IT SAY IT WAS GREAT, BUT THEY ARE LIARS. THESE ARE BAD PEOPLE. THESE ARE BAD PEOPLE, AND WHAT I DID SAY, AND WHAT I DID SAY IS THAT HE WAS GOOD AT ONE THING. HE WAS REALLY GOOD AT KILLING TERRORISTS. HE DIDN'T WAIT AROUND. DO YOU THINK THEY GIVE THE TERRORIST TRIALS THAT LASTED 18 YEARS? AND THEN AFTER 18 YEARS IF THEY HAD THE RIGHT LAWYER THEY ERECT A STATUE IN HONOR OF THE TERRORISTS, RIGHT? NOT WITH TRUMP. SO I SAID BAD GUY, REALLY BAD GUY, BUT HE WAS GOOD AT ONE THING. HE KILLED TERRORISTS. NEXT DAY DONALD TRUMP LOVES SADDAM HUSSEIN. I DON'T LOVE SADDAM HUSSEIN. I HATE SADDAM HUSSEIN, BUT HE WAS DAMN GOOD AT KILLING TERRORISTS, AND NOW TERRORIST PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BE TERRORISTS, THEY GO INTO IRAQ, AND I SAID LAST NIGHT, IT'S THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY, IT'S THE HARVARD OF TERRORISM. THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO BE A TERRORIST, YOU GO INTO IRAQ. BEFORE, BOOM, YOU'RE A TERRORIST! BOOM. LOOK AT THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. WE ARE A VERY UNSAFE NATION. WE ARE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO POUR INTO OUR COUNTRY. WE'RE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO POUR INTO OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE. THESE ARE PEOPLE COMING FROM THE MIDDLE EAST. WE'RE TAKING SYRIAN REFUGEES. BY THE WAY, I HAVE A BIGGER HEART THAN ANYBODY, AND WE'LL WORK WITH THEM, AND I'LL GET OTHER PEOPLE TO PUT UP THE MONEY BECAUSE WE OWE $19 TRILLION, AND NOW WITH THE KIND OF BUDGETS THAT GET PASSED IN THIS COUNTRY, WE'RE GOING UP TO $21 TRILLION. WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY, BUT I'LL GET THE GULF STATES TO PUT UP THE MONEY AND WE'LL SUPERVISE IT, AND WE WILL BUILD WONDERFUL, AS WONDERFUL AS THEY CAN BE, IN SYRIA, SAFE HAVENS. WE'LL BUILD SAFE ZONES AND WE'LL KEEP THEM THERE. WE DON'T WANT THEM HERE. WE DON'T WANT THEM HERE.   THEY ARE MOVING PEOPLE INTO OHIO THAT YOU PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT. THEY ARE MOVING PEOPLE INTO OHIO THAT VERY WELL THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE GREAT TROJAN HORSES OF ALL TIME. THEY ARE MOVING PEOPLE INTO OHIO LIKE NOBODY'S EVER SEEN, AND EVERY STATE, AND YOU DON'T KNOW AND YOUR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DON'T KNOW AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY AND WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT WON'T ISSUE THE WORDS ""RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM"" AND IT'S A REAL PROBLEM. IT'S A REAL PROBLEM! AND IF YOU DON'T SAY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM, RIGHT? SO I WATCH THESE MEDIA PEOPLE, VERY DISHONEST PEOPLE, AND I WATCHED THAT, AND THEN I ALSO WATCH IT. I GET ALL THE STANDING OVATIONS. IT WAS ON FOX LIVE, AND FOX WAS ACTUALLY VERY NICE TO ME, I MUST SAY, BUT IT WAS ON FOX LIVE. IT WAS ON CNN LIVE. CNN'S TERRIBLE TO ME, TERRIBLE. THEY ARE -- THEY ARE DISHONEST.   I MEAN -- DID YOU EVER SEE IT WHERE THEY HAVE LIKE SEVEN PEOPLE AND I'LL J JEFFREY -- AND I WILL HAVE JEFFREY LORD. I LOVE JEFFREY LORD, BUT I DON'T WATCH IT ANYMORE BECAUSE IN LIFE WHEN YOU DON'T LIKE SOMETHING, WHEN SOMETHING IS UNPLEASANT, DON'T WATCH IT. TURN TO SOMETHING ELSE. THAT'S WHAT I DO. I DON'T WATCH IT ANYMORE. WHEN PEOPLE TREAT YOU UNFAIRLY, JUST TURN YOUR BACK AND GO SOME PLACE ELSE, OR KNOCK THEM ON THEIR ASS, ONE OR THE OTHER.   SO, I MEAN, CNN OVER THE WEEKEND, I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. SO ONE OF MY GUYS WHO IS MARRIED TO A JEWISH WOMAN, THIS IS A VERY FINE PERSON, DAN SKAVINO. HE PUT OUT A TWEET TALKING ABOUT CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON. AND ON THE TWEET WAS A STAR, LIKE A STAR, AND WHEN I LOOKED AT IT, I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING. ALL OF A SUDDEN IT TURNED OUT TO BE IN THE MINDS OF THE PRESS ONLY, BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE BEEN A SHERIFF'S STAR, IT COULD HAVE BEEN A REGULAR STAR, MY BOY COMES HOME FROM SCHOOL, BARON. HE DRAWS STARS ALL OVER THE PLACE. OH, I NEVER SAID THAT'S THE STAR OF DAVID, BARON. DON'T. IT'S A STAR. HAVE YOU ALL SEEN THIS? IT'S A STAR! AND IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE A SHERIFF'S STAR, BUT, I DON'T KNOW, AND BEHIND IT THEY HAD MONEY. OH, BUT THERE'S MONEY BEHIND IT, SO ACTUALLY THEY ARE RACIALLY PROFILING -- THEY ARE PROFILING, NOT US, BECAUSE WHY ARE THEY BRINGING THIS UP? WHY DO THEY BRING IT UP? BECAUSE -- SO ANYWAY. SO DAN IS A WONDERFUL GUY, A REALLY GOOD GUY. I DIDN'T GET ANGRY AT HIM. I SAID, DAN, THAT'S A STAR. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. AND HE SAID -- CNN FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT, BIGGER THAN THE FBI WITH CLINTON, WHO IS CROOKED AS A YOU KNOW WHAT, BIGGER THAN THE FBI, ALL WEEKEND LONG CNN, THIS HONEST AS HELL, -- DISHONEST AS HELL, CNN MORNING TO NIGHT I HAVE TWEETS WHERE THEY ARE SAYING CNN WON'T TALK ABOUT ANYTHING BUT THE STAR. THEY SAY IT'S THE STAR OF DAVID, ALL RIGHT? I HAVE A SON-IN-LAW WHO IS JEWISH, JARED IS A GREAT GUY. MY DAUGHTER IS JEWISH. I HAVE GRANDCHILDREN THAT ARE HE IS A -- THAT THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. IVANKA MARRIED A JEWISH GUY WHO IS BRILLIANT, WHO IS WONDERFUL, WHO HAS A GREAT HEART. THEY HAVE KIDS. DID OF A KIDS. -- BEAUTIFUL KIDS. THEY TOOK THIS STAR. IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYTHING, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A SHERIFF STAR. CNN STARTED THIS DIALOGUE AND SAID, IT'S THE STAR OF DAVID. BECAUSE IT IS THE STAR OF DAVID, DONALD TRUMP HAS RACIST -- THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK. SOMEDAY, I WILL TELL YOU THE REAL STORY OF CNN. DON'T WATCH IT ANYMORE. I HAVE TO SAY, FOX IS TOUGH ON ME. BILL O'REILLY, A LOT OF THESE GUYS, BUT AT LEAST THEY'RE FAIR. MSNBC -- NOBODY WATCHES IT, SO I CAN'T TELL YOU. I HEAR THEY ARE BETTER THAN CNN. THEY CALL CNN THE CLINTON NEWS NETWORK. THE STAR -- WHEN THEY TOLD ME THE STAR OF DAVID I SAID, YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING. THEY ARE THE ONES WITH THE BAD TENDANCIES. THEY SAID, THERE IS MONEY AROUND THE STARS, SO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT REPRESENTS. THESE ARE BAD PEOPLE. DON'T WATCH CNN ANYMORE. I LIKE ANDERSON COOPER, AND A COUPLE OTHER PEOPLE, BUT MOSTLY IT IS NEGATIVE. THEY SIT AROUND THE TABLE AND TALK BADLY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. YOU KNOW WHAT IS INTERESTING? WE STARTED OFF AT 17 AND HERE I AM. YOU AND ME. LOOK WHAT WE HAVE DONE TOGETHER. WE HAVE UNBELIEVABLY DISHONEST MEDIA. THINK OF THAT, YOU HAVE THE STAR, WHICH IS FINE. THEY TOOK THE STAR DOWN. I SAID TOO BAD, JUST LEAVE IT UP. I WOULD RATHER HAVE DEFENDED IT. THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT CORRUPT HILLARY. BUT SHE STARTED THE DIALOGUE. SHE WANTED TO GET OFF THE FBI. YOU KNOW WHO GOT HURT WORSE THAN ANYBODY? BERNIE SANDERS. HE WAS WAITING FOR THE FBI TO MAKE HIM THE NOMINEE AND IT DIDN'T WORK OUT. HE COPIED MY LIKE WHICH A LITTLE BIT, BUT HE WAS STARTING TO SAY WITH -- MY LANGUAGE A LITTLE BIT, BUT HE WAS STARTING TO SAY WITH THE SUPERDELEGATES THAT THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED. 22% OF THE SANDERS VOTERS ARE COMING TO TRUMP.  I DON'T KNOW. WHO KNOWS? WE ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME. THE OTHER THING YOU CRITICIZED FOR LESS THAT, I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD SPEECH. DO I GIVE GOOD SPEECH?  I THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF THE BETTER SPEECHES. THEY NEVER SHOW HOW MANY PEOPLE. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I EVER HAD AN EMPTY PLACE? THE PLACE WAS PACKED. EVERYBODY WAS HAVING A GREAT TIME, CONSIDERING THE SUBJECT IS NO GOOD BECAUSE THE SUBJECT IS ABOUT OUR COUNTRY AND THE COUNTRY IS IN TROUBLE. LET ME TELL YOU, WITH THE 45% NUMBERS YOU HEAR ABOUT, IT IS A PHONY NUMBER. I WANT TO HAVE ANYBODY RAISE THEIR HAND. SOME HE LOOKS FOR A JOB. THE CAN'T FIND A JOB AND THEY GIVE UP AND NOW THEY ARE CONSIDERED STATISTICALLY EMPLOYED. SHOW THE PHONY NUMBER. I DON'T BLAME OBAMA SO GOOD. THIS ESTIMATE PRESIDENTS LOOK GOOD AND POLITICIANS LOOK GOOD. JUST AS I WAS GETTING OFF THE PLANE, WE ANNOUNCED TRADE DEFICIT NUMBERS FOR THE MONTH WHICH ARE ALMOST RECORD-SETTING. WE HAVE TRADE DEFICITS THAT ARE WORSE THAN EVER BEFORE. THESE TO TALK MORE ABOUT JAPAN AND NOT TO WORK AT CHINA BUT IT IS STILL JAPAN STOP EVERYBODY. WE DON'T MAKE GOOD DEALS WITH ANYBODY BUT LAST NIGHT I WAS TALKING ABOUT TRADE BECAUSE IT IS MY FAVORITE SUBJECT. THAT AND STRENGTHENING OUR MILITARY ARE MY FAVORITE SUBJECTS. OTHER THAN MY CHILDREN OR MY GRANDCHILDREN, I COULD TALK ABOUT MY GRANDCHILDREN -- HE WAS 39 MINUTES IN THE BACK OF THE PLANE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT HIS GRANDCHILDREN, HE HAS TWO, I HAVE A, AND THAT THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL SO HE SAYS, THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL, THEY ARE REALLY SMART. THEY ARE REALLY GOOD, I LOVE THEM SO MUCH. THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLE. ONE IS BRAND NEW. BEAUTIFUL BABY. AFTER A MINUTE, WHAT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT? YOU CAN SAY. HERE'S A PICTURE. THAT IS ONE MINUTE FROM 39 MINUTES. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT GOLF. -- THEN WE TALK ABOUT GOLF. THEN YOU SAY, JACK NICKLAUS. HE ENDORSED ME. I LOVE JACK. DO YOU KNOW HOW YOUNG JACK WAS WHEN HE WON THE OHIO STATE CHAMPIONSHIP? I FEEL GUILTY WHEN I ASKED FOR ENDORSEMENTS. I DON'T DO THAT. HE ENDORSED ME AND I SAID THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE IT. HE SAID YOU WILL DO A GREAT JOB AND THINK -- SHAKE THINGS UP. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WAITERS, IS JACK -- WINNERS, IS JACK A WINNER? I THINK JACK WAS IN THE TOP 1018 TIMES? -- TOP 10 LIKE 18 TIMES? THIS GUY IS A WINNER. WHEN I GET ENDORSEMENTS FROM JACK NICKLESS -- BOBBY KNIGHT. BOBBY WILL BE SPEAKING AT THE CONVENTION. I HAVE TO GO BACK. SO MANY PEOPLE. SUCH A GREAT CONVENTION PLANNED. I HAVE TO GO BACK. LAST NIGHT I MADE A GREAT SPEECH, STANDING OVATION AND EVERYONE IS CRAZY. NOBODY TALKS ABOUT THE CROWD. EVERY TIME I GO HOME MY WIFE SAYS HOW WAS THE CROWD? THEY NEVER SHOWED THE CROWD. I TELL YOU. THEY ONLY SHOW WHEN WE HAVE PROTESTERS. I LOVE MY PROTESTERS. DON'T WE HAVE ANY DAMN PROTESTERS TODAY? BECAUSE WHEN WE HAVE PROTESTERS -- YOU THINK YOU HAVE ONE? HE'S -- FRIEND OR FOE? HE'S FRIEND. OK. BUT I LOVE MY PROTESTERS BECAUSE THE CAMERAS SPIN AROUND AT ANGLES YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. THEY DO SOMERSAULTS AROUND. THEY LOOK LIKE A SAUSAGE BECAUSE I WENT -- MY FIRST TWO SPEECHES I HAD NO PROTESTERS, AND EVERY TIME I WENT HOME, BIG CROWDS, AND EVERY TIME I WENT HOME DID YOU SEE THE SIZE OF THE CROWD? NO, I DIDN'T. YOU CAN HEAR THE SIZE. LAST NIGHT YOU COULD HEAR THE SIZE. MANY, MANY MORE THAN THE PRESIDENT AND HILLARY GOT SO PEOPLE WOULD SAY, WELL, I HEAR IT. THEY HEAR THAT SORT OF HUMMING SORT OF, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT LIKE FROM 12 PEOPLE, BUT WE HAVE THIS -- SO WHAT HAPPENS IS LAST NIGHT WE HAVE A GREAT EVENING IN NORTH CAROLINA. WE'RE GOING TO WIN NORTH CAROLINA. WE'RE GOING TO WIN OHIO. WE'RE DOING GREAT HERE. BY THE WAY, THE SECTION I JUST LEFT LAST WEEK, WONDERFUL CONGRESSMAN AND HIS WIFE AND I SAID TO HIM, I WON'T -- I DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS ANYBODY, BUT I SAID DID YOU ENDORSE ME? HE SAID EVEN I DON'T LIKE YOU, I WOULD ENDORSE YOU. YOU KNOW WHY, MR. TRUMP, YOU HAVE A 29-POINT LEAD IN THIS SECTION. YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO ENDORSE ME. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR MINERS, AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR STEEL WORKERS. HILLARY IS NOT. SHE'S GOING TO PUT YOU OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE IF SHE EVER WON , SHE WOULD SIGN TPP WHICH WILL MAKE NAFTA WHICH WAS SIGNED BY HER HUSBAND WHICH IS THE WORST, IN MY OPINION, THE WORST TRADE DEAL IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY AND IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE, SIGNED BY BILL CLINTON, AND HE DIDN'T SUFFER FROM IT. IT WAS EVERYBODY THAT FOLLOWED HIM THAT SUFFERED FROM IT. WHERE YOUR JOBS ARE MOVING. I LOOK AT YOUR JOBS WHERE THEY ARE MOVING DOWN TO MEXICO, RIGHT? THEY ARE MOVING TO MEXICO. ONE AFTER ANOTHER, THEY ARE MOVING TO MEXICO. CHINA IS COMING AND DUMPING THE STEEL AND MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOUR STEEL PLANTS. THEY ARE DEVALUING THEIR CURRENCIES. WE DO NOTHING ABOUT IT. FOLKS, I'M GOING DO SO MUCH ABOUT IT. IT'S GOING TO BE SO EASY. IT'S GOING TO BE SO EASY. SO LAST NIGHT WE HAD THIS AND THEN I WAKE UP AND I HEAR NUMBER ONE I LOVE SADDAM HUSSEIN. I HATE SADDAM HUSSEIN, BUT I LOVE SADDAM HUSSEIN ACCORDING TO THE PRESS BECAUSE THEY ARE DISHONEST AS HELL. THEY HEARD WHAT I SAID, AND NUMBER TWO, AND THEY SAID IT VERY, VERY STRONGLY. THEY SAID HE SHOULD HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON LONGER. NOW, I WROTE OUT LIKE FOUR PAGES THAT I WROTE OUT, AND I READ IT. POINT BY POINT BY POINT, AND AFTER A LONG TIME, I DON'T KNOW, MANY, MANY MINUTES, I GOT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND THIS STUPID GUY, CHUCK TODD. I WON'T USE HIS NAME. I REFUSE TO USE HIS NAME. I REFUSE TO CALL HIM SLEEPY EYES. I'M NOT GOING TO CALL HIM SLEEPY EYES ANYMORE. HE'S TALKING ABOUT HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HIT HILLARY CLINTON. DID YOU SEE WHAT I DID TO HER LAST NIGHT? I JUST -- AM I CORRECT? I MEAN, IT GOT TO A POINT -- IT GOT -- I WAS HITTING HER SO HARD, AND THE PROBLEM IS I'M A PROFESSIONAL, AND I'M HITTING HER SO HARD, AND I KNOW IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED, AND IT'S FIXED AND IT'S BROKEN. SO I'M DOING IT AND I'M DOING IT BECAUSE I FEEL I HAVE TO DO IT, AND IT'S SORT OF BORING TO DO IT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, AND I WANTED TO GET ON TO THE MILITARY AND THE VETS. I WANTED TO GET ON TO THESE OTHER SUBJECTS. I WANTED TO GET ON TO TERROR, OK, BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE THINGS THAT YOU WON'T EVEN BELIEVE, FOLKS. WATCH THE PREDICTIONS. LOTS OF PREDICTIONS, RIGHT! AND I WANTED TO GET ON TO TERROR AND ONE OF THE REASONS THE WOMEN ARE LIKING ME A LOT LATELY --  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. BECAUSE THEY FEEL I'M GOING TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE. I'M GOING TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE. AND THEY LOVE IVANKA AND THEY LOVE MELANIA AND IVANKA AND DONE WILL BE SPEAKING AT THE CONVENTION, AND BY THE WAY -- SO I GET HIT THIS MORNING. HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO -- EVERYONE SAID I MADE A GREAT SPEECH. I TELL YOU HOW BAD MY SPEECH WAS LAST NIGHT. CNN COVERED IT FROM POINT TO POINT WITHOUT A COMMERCIAL. FOX COVERED IT PRACTICALLY FROM BEGINNING TO END. OTHERS COVERED IT -- THAT'S HOW BAD MY SPEECH WAS YESTERDAY. THAT'S HOW BAD. YOU KNOW, IF IT WERE BAD, FOLKS, THESE GUYS -- THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT POLLS. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING. THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT WHAT ONE THING. WHAT'S THE ONE THING? RATINGS, RATINGS. SO I MADE A SPEECH LAST NIGHT THAT SOME OF THE FOLKS GAVE AN ""A"" TO AND SOME OF THEM GIVE AN A-PLUS TO, BUT WHEN I SAW NBC, SLEEPY EYES CHUCK TODD THIS MORNING SAY HE HAD A CHANCE TO REALLY GO AFTER HILLARY CLINTON. OH, WHAT I DID TO HER. BUT AFTER A WHILE WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT OTHER THINGS, OK. SO HERE'S THE STORY. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK, FOR EVERYBODY. NOT FOR US. NOT FOR THIS ROOM. NOT FOR THIS ROOM. NOT FOR THE OVERFLOW ROOM. NOT FOR THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK FOR EVERYONE. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT BACK FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH WHO HAVE A 59% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, BY THE WAY, 59%. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT BACK FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH WHO HAVE A 59% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND HAVE NO CHANCE. THEY HAVE NO CHANCE IN OUR SOCIETY. YOU KNOW WHO I JUST SPOKE TO, BIG DON KING. BIG DON KING. JUST SPOKE TO HIM. DON, I WOULD LOVE YOU TO SPEAK AT THE CONVENTION, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT. YOU BEAT THE SYSTEM. AND HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE. BIG DON, BIGGEST BOXING PROMOTER OF ALL TIME. IN FACT, SOMEBODY SAID AND MIKE TYSON ENDORSED ME AS YOU KNOW AND DON KING ENDORSED ME. YOU KNOW WHAT DON KING DOES. HE OWNS A NEWSPAPER. HE ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT, BERNIE SANDERS FOR VICE PRESIDENT, AND HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT? HE PUT A BIG AD IN THE PAPER, HIS PAPER. HE WANTS BERNIE SANDERS FOR VICE PRESIDENT. I SAID THAT'S A NEW ONE. BIG DON KING. >>   >>  >> I LIKE THAT, TOO. WE LIKE NEWT, AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. NEWT HAS BEEN MY FRIEND FOR A LONG TIME. I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING AND I'M NOT TELLING NEWT ANYTHING, ONE FORM OR ANOTHER, NEWT GINGRICH WILL BE INVOLVED WITH OUR GOVERNMENT, OK? HE'S SMART. HE'S TOUGH. HE GETS IT. AND HE SAYS I'M THE BIGGEST THING HE'S EVER SEEN IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS. NOW, NEWT'S GOING TO BE INVOLVED IF I CAN GET APPROVAL FROM HIS WIFE. THAT MAY BE TOUGH, BUT THAT'S OK. AND, YOU KNOW, I HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE VERY SPECIAL HERE. SO I HAVE WONDERFUL CHILDREN AND AND I'M LUCKY THEY WERE SMART. THEY WERE BORN SMART. THEY WERE SMART, AND GOD WAS GOOD AND THEY WENT TO GREAT SCHOOLS AND THEY DID WELL AND THEY ARE IN BUSINESS AND THEY DO WELL AND THEY FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT WHAT I'M DOING. THEY DON'T EVEN LIKE IT IN TERMS OF DOING IT THEMSELVES. THEY LOVE WHAT THEY ARE DOING. MY ONE BOY IS HERE. ERIC TRUMP, ERIC. AND I'M VERY PROUD OF ERIC. HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB IN THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS AND KNEW I THREW HIM INTO THIS POLITICAL BUSINESS AND HE'S DOING A GOOD JOB AND HE LOVES THE REAL ESTATE. LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY. I LOVE THIS CROWD. ISN'T IT NICE WHEN YOU DON'T READ FROM A SPEECH? LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE OR HILLARY WITH THE TELEPROMPTERS EVERY SINGLE TIME. AND WHETHER YOU GO NORTH AND SOUTH OR EAST AND WEST DONALD TRUMP IS A BAD PERSON. DONALD TRUMP MADE A LOT OF MONEY IN ATLANTIC CITY AND SHE HURT THE LITTLE PEOPLE. CALLS IT THE LITTLE PEOPLE. DIDN'T. MADE A LOT OF MONEY AND GOVERNMENT, WHAT THEY DID, I'LL TELL YOU, DID YOU SEE THAT SHAM? I LEFT SEVEN YEARS AGO. BUT SHE GOES AND AFTER A LITTLE WHILE, EVER NOTICE AFTER 12 MINUTES, PEOPLE START LEAVING. WE CAN'T DO THAT. THE NICE PART IS LET ME TELL YOU. I GO TO SCOTLAND AND I KNOW I'M GOING TO GET KILLED IF I GO TO SCOTLAND BECAUSE THE PRESS IS SO DISHONEST. AND I WENT THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT MY BOY, I BOUGHT TURNBERRY FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO AND DOING A MASSIVE RENOVATION JUST LIKE WE'RE OPENING THE OLD POST OFFICE IN OCTOBER. WE'RE A YEAR AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. I COULD OPEN IT SOONER BUT I WANTED TO GET IT AS CLOSE TO THE ELECTION. I WAS GOING TO OPEN IN AUCTION, -- AUGUST, I'M DELAYING IT, THE HOTEL IS GOING TO OPEN SOONER. BUT I WANT TO SAY WE'RE MORE THAN A YEAR AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND WE'RE UNDER BUDGET AND THE PRODUCT IS EVEN BETTER THAN I SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE, RIGHT? MAYBE I'LL OPEN IT ON NOVEMBER 7TH, THE DAY BEFORE THE BIG DAY, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AND THE PRESS WILL BE THERE. THEY WILL BE THERE BY THE HUNDREDS, BUT THEY DON'T SAY WE'RE UNDER BUDGET. THEY WON'T SAY WE'RE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. PEOPLE KNOW, BUT WHAT HAPPENED IS WE HAVE CHILDREN. WE HAVE CHILDREN AND I WANT TO SUPPORT MY CHILDREN AND I WANT TO SUPPORT MY CHILDREN. SO I PUT ERIC TRUMP, IVANKA HAS BEEN GREAT AND DON HAS BEEN GREAT, AND TIFFANY IS JUST STARTING NOW, SHE'S JUST GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE. BARON HAS GREAT POTENTIAL BUT HE'S 10, YOU KNOW. BUT HE HAS GREAT POTENTIAL AND I PUT MY CHILDREN AS THEY GROW A LITTLE BIT OLDER IN CHARGE OF DIFFERENT JOBS AND I PUT ERIC IN CHARGE OF THE GREAT TURNBERRY RESORT IN SCOTLAND, THE HOME OF THE BRITISH OPEN WHICH NOW THEY CALL THE OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP, AND ERIC SPENT THE LAST YEAR GOING BACK AND FORTH. HE'D SPEND TWO DAYS OVER THERE AND GO BACK AND FIGHT WITH CONTRACTORS AND HE GOT GREAT CONTRACTORS AND THEY DID AN UNBELIEVABLE JOB AND I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT IT AND IF I GO OVER THERE THESE DISHONEST HORRIBLE HUMAN BEINGS TRUMP WENT OVER TO PLAY GOLF IN THE MIDDLE OF A CAMPAIGN. I CAN'T DO THAT, BUT I HAVE TO SUPPORT MY CHILDREN, RIGHT? SO I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT. I WANT TO FLY OVER AND I'M GOING TO FLY BACK AND I WANT TO SUPPORT MY SON. SO WHAT HAPPENED -- BUT JUST TO SHOW YOU -- NO, NO. JUST TO SHOW YOU HOW DISHONEST HILLARY CLINTON IS AND THE PRESS, SO I GO OUT AND WE HAVE THE BAGPIPES, WE HAVE EVERYTHING. WE HAVE A RIBBON CUTTING ON THE NINTH TEE, ON THE BEAUTIFUL NINTH TEE OVERLOOKING THE OCEAN, AND -- AND THE BEAUTIFUL LIGHTHOUSE. ONE OF THE GREATEST COURSES ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. WE REBUILT THE COURSE AND EVERYTHING. WE REBUILT THE HOTEL. IT'S GREAT, AND -- AND THAT WAS THE DAY THAT EUROPE HAD THE BIG TURN WHERE THE UK LEFT, RIGHT? THEY LEFT. AND I SAID, NOT BRAG BEING, BUT I HAVE A PULSE. WE NEED SOMEBODY WITH TOUCH. WE HAVE HORRIBLE PEOPLE. THEY HAVE NO TOUCH. NO BRAIN. NO NOTHING. SO OBAMA SAYS IF THAT HAPPENS THEY WILL GO TO THE BACK OF THE LINE. I WOULD SAY THAT -- I THINK OBAMA MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE REASON THAT THEY BROKE AWAY, OK? HE SAID THAT THE UK IS GOING TO THE BACK OF THE LINE. NOT A NICE STATEMENT. NOT A NICE STATEMENT. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I SAID THAT? THE BACK. OH, WOULD I BE KILLED FOR THAT STATEMENT. GOING TO THE BACK OF THE LINE. BOTTOM LINE, THEY ASKED ME A LOT OF TIMES. I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BREAK AWAY. I THINK THEY WANT THEIR INDEPENDENCE. I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BREAK AWAY. BREAK AWAY. I SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING WHERE COUNTRIES ARE BEING FORCED AGAINST THEIR WILL TO TAKE THESE PEOPLE AND THEY DON'T WANT THEM AND INSTEAD OF BUILDING THESE WONDERFUL PLACES WHERE THEY CAN ULTIMATELY GO BACK TO THEIR HOMELAND WHERE THEY WANT TO BE ANYWAY, THEY ARE JUST BEING FORCED SO GERMANY IS A DISASTER RIGHT NOW. SWEDEN, PARTS OF SWEDEN. I MEAN, THINGS ARE REALLY BAD, SO I SAID I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO -- BY THE WAY, THE ODDS WERE 20% THAT I WOULD BE RIGHT. 20, BECAUSE THEY SAID IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THEY ARE GOING TO ABRIEF AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE END OF THAT. I WAS RIGHT. THEY BROKE AWAY. THEY BROKE AWAY. I WAS RIGHT. AND THEN THE NEXT DAY OH, THEY SAID TRUMP WAS RIGHT, THE SAME THING COULD HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES. LET ME TELL YOU. WE'RE GOING TO RIGHT A SECOND TIME AND WE'RE TIRED OF INCOMPETENT PEOPLE AND HILLARY CLINTON, I SAID BAD JUDGMENT. SHE'S INCOMPETENT, OK? SHE'S INCOMPETENT. THE ONLY GOOD THING SHE'S EVER DONE IS GET OUT OF TROUBLE WHEN ANYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN JAIL BY NOW. THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT I'VE EVER SEEN HER DO THAT WAS A GREAT JOB. I'VE GOT TO GIVE HER CREDIT. I GOT TO GIVE HER CREDIT. I'VE GOT TO GIVE BILL CLINTON CREDIT FOR GOING TO THAT PLANE AND SAYING FOR 39 MINUTES HE TALKED ABOUT HIS GRANDCHILDREN AND HE TALKED ABOUT GOLF. THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN DO THAT. I TOLD YOU. TWO MINUTES FOR THE GRANDCHILDREN, TWO MINUTES FOR GOLF. WE'VE GOT 35 OR 36 MINUTES LEFT. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO TALK ABOUT? LET'S TALK ABOUT HILLARY. AND HILLARY THEN TALKS ABOUT I THINK I'D REAPPOINT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND YOU'RE WAITING FOR A DECISION BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE HER A JOB. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT. THAT'S BRIBERY, FOLKS, AND THEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL COMES OUT AS NEWT SAID, BUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL COMES OUT AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS NO CHARGES. THAT'S BRIBERY, WOULDN'T YOU SAY THAT'S BRIBERY? SHE SAID SHE'S GOING TO REAPPOINT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS WAITING TO MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT SHE'S GUILTY AND BOY WAS THAT A FAST DETERMINATION, WOW. COULD HAVE AT LEAST WAITED A LITTLE BIT LONGER. DON'T JUST COME OUT WITH ONE OR TWO SENTENCES. TALK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT. SO, LOOK, AGAIN, AGAIN, TROUBLE. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS. SO I GO TO SCOTLAND, BEAUTIFUL. THE WEATHER WAS BEAUTIFUL AND THE WAVES ARE CRASHING UP ON THE ROCKS. WE'RE OPENING THE COURSE AND GETTING READY TO CUT A RIB BONN. WE HAVE SO MANY PRESS. WE HAD OVER 400, THE LEGENDARY, HOW MANY, 400. 450. IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL THERE FOR BREXIT AND THEY WERE ALL THERE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. WILL THE UK BREAK AWAY AND NOW THAT'S ABOUT SIX HOURS OLD SO THEY ARE BORED AND THEY WANT THE NEXT STORY AND THE NEXT STORY IS TRUMP SO I GO THERE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I START HEARING WHAT'S TRUMP DOING IN SCOTLAND? WELL, HE'S PLAYING GOLF. SO I HAVE A NEWS CONFERENCE. EVEN NEWT SAID THAT WAS A GREAT NEWS CONFERENCE. EVEN I DID A GOOD JOB. I DID A GOOD JOB, NEWT? WHEN NEWT SAYS I DID A GOOD JOB. HE'S A VERY CRITICAL GUY. HE SOMETIMES SAYS I DON'T LIKE WHAT HE'S SAYING AND SO LET ME JUST TELL YOU. ANY QUESTIONS. ANY QUESTIONS? AND THE PLACE GOES CRAZY, THE CAMERAS. I'M TELLING YOU, WE HAD AS BIG A GROUP OF MEDIA AS YOU'VE EVER SEEN. THEY ALL DROVE UP, YOU KNOW, FROM LONDON, DIFFERENT PLACES. EVERYBODY JUST CONVERGED ON TURNBERRY AND I'M TAKING QUESTIONS, AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS MR. TRUMP IF THE POUND GOES DOWN, HOW WILL TURNBERRY DO? SO I SAY I DIDN'T BRING THIS UP. I SAID, LOOK, HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS. IF THE POUND GOES DOWN, TURNBERRY WILL DO VERY WELL BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TRAVEL TO THE UK, THEY WILL COME TO SCOTLAND. TURNBERRY IS GOING TO DO VERY WELL IF THE POUND GOES DOWN, PERIOD, NEXT DAY IT'S IN AN AD BY CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON AND I'M ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THEY DON'T SHOW THE QUESTION. HERE'S THE THING. DID YOU HEAR DONALD TRUMP? ALL HE TALKED ABOUT WAS HIS RESORT AND THEY SHOW ME. THEY DON'T SHOW THE QUESTION. IF THE POUND GOES DOWN, TURNBERRY'S GOING TO DO VERY WELL. OK. THEN THEY GAVE ME A GOLF CLUB. I SAID I DON'T WANT TO TOUCH IT. I DON'T WANT TO TOUCH GOLF. I DON'T -- I'M LEAVING. I INSPECTED THE HOTEL. I INSPECTED THE COURSE. I SAID ERIC TRUMP, YOU DID A GREAT JOB. I'M GETTING THE HELL OUT OF HERE NOW BECAUSE I WANT TO BE BACK CAMPAIGNING. I'M GOING TO GET OUT. CONGRATULATIONS, MY BOY, I LOVE YOU. COME UP, ERIC, COME UP, ERIC. I LOVE YOU, MY BOY. I LOVE YOU. I SAID -- THAT'S MY 6'6"" BOY BUT HE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE MY BOY, RIGHT? SO I SAID, ERIC, I'M OUT OF HERE. I'M GOING, I'M LEAVING, I'VE GOT TO GO, BUT THEY SAID, MR. TRUMP, WOULD YOU LIKE TO HIT THE FIRST BALL? NO, I DON'T WANT TO TOUCH A CLUB BECAUSE I KNOW IF I TOUCH A CLUB THESE HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE HUMAN BEINGS PLUS THE HILLARY CLINTON 1,000-PEOPLE STAFF THAT SHE HAS, RIGHT, WILL COME UP WITH A CLIP OF ME HOLDING A GOLF CLUB SO I DON'T WANT TO TOUCH IT. WE CUT THE RIBBON, I INSPECTED THE PROPERTY AND I'M VERY PROUD OF THE JOB HE DID, UNBELIEVABLE JOB, AND I WENT AROUND AND I GOT OUT OF THERE, I WAS IN SCOTLAND ONE NIGHT. THAT'S NOT EASY. IT'S A LONG TRIP, RIGHT? I WAS THERE ONE NIGHT AND I WAS OUT OF THERE. SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS. THE NEXT DAY THE NEWS COMES ON. DONALD TRUMP WHO WENT TO SCOTLAND IN THE MIDDLE. OF THE CAMPAIGN TO PLAY GOLF, BUT HERE'S WHAT'S WORSE, THEY TOOK MY STATEMENT ON THE POUND, IF THE POUND GOES DOWN, TURNBERRY'S GOING TO DO GREAT. THEY DON'T KNOW I'M ANSWERING A QUESTION, SO EVERYONE THINKS I'M BRAG AND I WANT THE POUND TO GO DOWN, BUT HERE'S THE WORST. SO THAT CROOKED, CROOKED, DISGUSTING GROUP THAT WORKS FOR HILLARY CLINTON, NOW, REMEMBER, I NEVER TOUCHED A CLUB. I NEVER -- THEY SHOW ME HITTING A BALL. DONALD TRUMP PLAYING GOLF IN SCOTLAND DURING THE, YOU KNOW, TROUBLES AND EVERYTHING ELSE OF THE WORLD AND THEY PUT IT IN AN AD, BUT THE PICTURE WAS FROM TWO YEARS BEFORE AT A DIFFERENT COURSE! THE ONLY GOOD THING -- NO, IT'S TRUE, AND THEY SAID PLAYING GOLF AT TURNBERRY. TWO GOOD THINGS HAPPENED OUT OF IT. NUMBER ONE, THE HEAD OF TURNBERRY SAID, SIR, DID YOU TAKE AN AD BECAUSE WE'RE BEING SWAMPED WITH BUSINESS, REALLY? THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT, THAT'S GOOD, AND THE OTHER THING IS THE SWING LOOKED GOOD. THEY DIDN'T PUT ONE OF MY BAD SWINGS. I HAVE THEM. THE SWING LOOKS VERY GOOD. HILLARY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOW DISHONEST IS THE THAT? SO THEY SHOW ME PLAYING GOLF AT TURNBERRY AND I DIDN'T PLAY GOLF. THE PICTURE WAS TWO YEARS OLD OR MORE. IN FACT, IT WAS MORE! YOU KNOW HOW I CAN TELL IT WAS WAS MORE? I WAS EVEN THINNER. I SAID, MAN, I LIKE THAT -- I NEVER -- I LOVE THE SWING AND I LOOKED THIN, WELL, RELATIVELY THIN. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THIS YOUNG GUY, MY DAUGHTER, MY OTHER SON DON, MY WIFE WHO PUTS UP WITH A LOT WITH ALL OF THAT GOING ON. I MEAN, THIS IS BIG STUFF. THIS IS BIG STUFF. BUT MY FAMILY HAS BEEN SO -- MY SISTER, WHO IS INCREDIBLE, MY SISTER WHO IS A FEDERAL JUDGE, COURT OF APPEALS. MY OTHER SISTER, ELIZABETH. MY BROTHER ROBERT WHO IS A GREAT GUY. I HAVE ONE BROTHER WHO PASSED AWAY, BUT I HAVE GREAT CHILDREN. TIFFANY HAS BEEN SO AMAZING. MY KIDS, MY FAMILY HAVE BEEN SO UNBELIEVABLE, AND THIS IS NOT EASY FOR THEM. THEY GO OUT. MOSTLY PEOPLE LOVE IT, BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T. YOU KNOW, THE ONE THING THAT'S INTERESTING, AND I TOLD THIS TO ERIC ON THE PLANE, MY WIFE SAID, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GO OUT, YOU NEVER -- EVERYBODY LOVED YOU. NOW MOST PEOPLE LOVE YOU, BUT THERE'S PEOPLE THAT DON'T. YOU NEVER HAD THOSE PEOPLE BEFORE. I SAID BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AND ULTIMATELY, HOPEFULLY, MY BIGGEST DREAM IS TO HAVE THOSE PEOPLE LOVE ME, TOO, NOT BECAUSE OF ME, BUT BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO DO SUCH A GREAT JOB, DOES THAT MAKE SENSE, RIGHT? SO I'LL INTRODUCE ERIC TRUMP. RARICK TRUMP DID AN UNBELIEVABLE JOB. HE'S DOING AN UNBELIEVABLE JOB, AND HE WAS PUSHED INTO THE WORLD OF POLITICS NOT BECAUSE HE WANTED IT, BUT BECAUSE I SAID GOOD LUCK ON TELEVISION TONIGHT, YOU'RE DOING THE SHOW. SO ERIC TRUMP, EVERYBODY.  >> THANK YOU, ERIC, THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND THANK YOU, EVERYBODY, AND FAMILY HAS JUST BEEN INCREDIBLE. SO WHEN I WAS GETTING OFF THE PLANE I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU A COUPLE OF GOOD THINGS AND A COUPLE OF BAD THINGS ABOUT THE COUNTRY AND WHAT'S GOING ON. TERRORISM IS AT A -- JUST AT A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE LEVEL. PEOPLE DON'T FEEL SAFE. POLLS ARE COMING OUT PEOPLE FEEL MORE UNSAFE RIGHT NOW THAN THEY HAVE AT ANY TIME FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE FEEL SAFE AGAIN. YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL SAFE AGAIN. I'M VERY, VERY PROUD OF THE FACT IN A WHEN WE RAN THAT IN THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, YOU'VE GOT THE MOST VOTES EVER BY A LOT. ALMOST 14 MILLION VOTES. MORE THAN ANYBODY THAT'S EVER RUN AND I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT FACT. AND MAYBE MORE IMPORTANT, AND I WANT TO THANK THE RNC AND REINCE PRIEBUS. HE'S BEEN GREAT. I HAVE TO TELL YOU REINCE HAS BEEN GREAT, AND I MEAN THAT 100%. HE'S BEEN SO AMAZING. HE WORKS HARD. HE'LL FLY IF THERE'S AN EVENT IN CALIFORNIA. HE WILL FLY ON THAT PLANE AND HE'LL BE THERE. I'LL SAY WEREN'T YOU JUST IN WASHINGTON? YES, I FLEW TO BE AT THE EVENT. THE GUY IS REALLY TERRIFIC, BUT IT WAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT THE REPUBLICANS IN TERMS OF THE PRIMARY VOTERS, FINAL COUNT, FINAL COUNT, 62% UP FROM FOUR YEARS AGO. IT'S UNHEARD OF. THAT'S UNHEARD OF NUMBERS.   >> THAT IS AN UNHEARD OF -- DID YOU KNOW, THAT NEWT? THAT IS AN UNHEARD OF NUMBER. THE DEMOCRATS. THERE WAS A MOSQUITO. I DON'T WANT MOSQUITOS AROUND ME. I DON'T LIKE MOSQUITOS. I DON'T LIKE THOSE MOSQUITOS, I NEVER DID. SPEAKING OF MOSQUITOS, HELLO, HILLARY, HOW ARE YOU DOING?   >> SO THE DEMOCRATS -- THE DEMOCRATS WERE DOWN, WITH ALL THE BERNIE SANDERS STUFF AND EVERYTHING YOU HEAR AND ALL THIS AND BY THE WAY, OUR CROWDS ARE SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HIS, IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE, BUT WITH ALL OF THE THINGS YOU HEAR THE DEMOCRATS ARE DOWN 21% FROM FOUR YEARS AGO. THERE'S NO REAL ENTHUSIASM. IF THEY HAD ENTHUSIASM FOR BERNIE AND BERNIE WAS OUTFLANKED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT. HE WAS REALLY OUTFLANKED. HE NEVER HAD A CHANCE AND FRANKLY I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD A CHANCE EXCEPT WE WERE WINNING BY SUCH LARGE NUMBERS. IF WE DIDN'T WIN, FLORIDA A 21-POINT VICTORY, WON 66 OF 67 COUNTIES. NEW YORK, PENNSYLVANIA, CONNECTICUT. YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT PLACES, RHODE ISLAND, MARYLAND, DELAWARE. WE HAD A GROUP WHERE WE WON EVERY SINGLE COUNTY IN EVERY SINGLE STATE. IN CALIFORNIA I GOT 78% OF THE VOTE, AND THERE WERE STILL LOTS OF NAMES ON THERE, AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF VOTES IN THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND WE HAD 17 PEOPLE RUNNING, FOLKS. THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE AS OPPOSED TO TWO OR THREE OR FOUR. WE HAD 17 PEOPLE SO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN THAT NUMBER WHEN YOU HAVE 17 PEOPLE, AND WE WON EASILY, MORE THAN RONALD REAGAN WHO WE LOVE. MORE THAN RICHARD NIXON, MORE THAN THE BUSHES, MORE THAN DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER WHO DID HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH THE SECOND WORLD WAR VICTORY IN ALL FAIRNESS. THAT'S A GREAT THING. THE BAD PART IS THIS. IN COMING OFF THE PLANE I HEARD THAT OUR TRADE NUMBERS ARE A DISASTER, A DISASTER. GETTING WORSE THAN EVER BEFORE. WE'RE LOSING SO MUCH MONEY. WE HAVE TRADE DEFICITS THAT ARE SO MASSIVE. NOT ONLY WITH CHINA, NOT ONLY WITH MEXICO, WHICH IS MASSIVE. I GIVE -- I TAKE MY HATS OFF TO THE LEADERSHIP OF MEXICO FOR THE JOB THEY HAVE DONE ON US. THEY TREAT US LIKE WE'RE BABIES. THEY TREAT US AT THE BORDER AND WITH TRADE. YOU EVER SEE THE COMPANIES THAT ARE MOVING TO MEXICO? I THINK I WON INDIANA LARGELY BECAUSE CARRIER AIR CONDITIONING COMPANY -- I LOVE INDIANA AND I ALSO WON BECAUSE OF THE GREAT BOBBY KNIGHT, RIGHT, BOBBY KNIGHT. I TOLD YOU THAT STORY WHERE BOBBY CALLED UP AND HE SAID, SIR. YOU'VE GOT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. THAT A YEAR BEFORE I DID IT. YOU'RE GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I SAID IS THIS REALLY BOBBY KNIGHT. I DIDN'T KNOW BOBBY KNIGHT AND THEN WHEN I RAN AND I GOT TO INDIANA, SOMEBODY SAID YOU THINK YOU COULD EVER GET BOBBY KNIGHT? AND I SAID I THINK SO AND I HAD HIS PAPER AND I HAD HIS NUMBER, AND HE PICKS UP THE PHONE AND HE GOES I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO CALL. HE'S A COOL DUDE. HE WON 900 GAMES. HE WON THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS FOR INDIANA. HE WON THE OLYMPICS. HE WON THE PAN-AM GAMES. HE HAD THE LAST UNDEFEATED SEASON IN COLLEGE BASKETBALL. HE'S A WINNER. JACK NICKLAUS AND JACK, YOU KNOW, WHEN OHIO, TO ME HAVING HIS ENDORSEMENT IS SO GREAT AND JACK AND BOBBY, WE HAVE SO MANY UNBELIEVABLE CHAMPS ENDORSING, SO MANY UNBELIEVABLE CHAMPS AND HERE'S THE STORY, FOLKS. WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT AROUND. WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUR JOBS BACK TO THIS COUNTRY, AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING THEM BACK BIG LEAGUE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET COMPANIES LEAVE OUR COUNTRY WITHOUT THERE BEING CONSEQUENCES, CONSEQUENCES. AS AN EXAMPLE. WHEN CARRIER LEFT AND THEY LEFT 1,400 PEOPLE AND THOSE 1,400 PEOPLE, MANY OF THEM FOLLOWED ME ALL OVER INDIANA. THEY LOVE TRUMP BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT SPOKE THEIR LANGUAGE. THEY WERE FIRED LIKE DOGS. THEY WERE FIRED BY A MID-LEVEL MANAGEMENT GUY. THEY HAD JOCKS, SOME OF THEM FOR 30 YEARS. THEY WERE FIRED VICIOUSLY LIKE YOU NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT, AND FORTUNATELY SOMEBODY HAD THE CELL PHONE AND WE NEVER -- I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW AND IT WAS ALL OVER THE NEWS, AND IT MADE A BIG IMPACT, AND I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT LONG BEFORE I WENT TO INDIANA. THE OTHER GUYS JUST STARTED TALKING ABOUT IT WHEN THEY ARRIVED TO TRY AND WIN BECAUSE THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE FIRE WALL. REMEMBER, THE FIRE WALL. TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN NEW YORK, BUT TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN ALSO PENNSYLVANIA AND THESE OTHER STATES, CONNECTICUT. WE'RE DOING GREAT IN CONNECTICUT, TOO, BY THE WAY, BUT TRUMP'S GOING TO WIN ALL THESE STATES BUT WHEN WE GET TO INDIANA, THAT'S THE FIRE WALL. TRUMP'S NOT GOING TO WIN THE FIREWALL. AND WE WON THE FIREWALL IN A LANDSLIDE. THAT WAS A BIG, BIG, AND THEN EVERYBODY JUST SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAID? WE JUST CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. WE'RE LEAVING, GONE AND THAT WAS THE END OF THAT, RIGHT? BUT WE'VE HAD AN AMAZING PERIOD OF TIME, BUT WHAT I WOULD HAVE TOLD CARRIER AIR CONDITIONING, AND I WOULD IF I CAN GET THERE IN TIME. I WOULD HAVE SAID ENJOY YOUR PLANT, HOT WEATHER. PRETTY HOT UP HERE, TOO, BY THE WAY. HOT WEATHER. I SAID ENJOY YOUR PLANT AND MAKE LOTS OF AIR CONDITIONERS, BUT WHEN YOU START SELLING AIR CONDITIONERS THROUGH A VERY STRONG BORDER AND WE HAVE A VERY STRONG BORDER AND I WANT PEOPLE TO COME IN. I WANT PEOPLE TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY. THEY ARE GOING TO COME IN BY THE THOUSANDS, BUT THEY ARE GOING TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY LEGALLY, RIGHT? LEGALLY. SO I'M GOING TO SAY MYSELF OR MY REP, AND I ALWAYS SAY TO MY WIFE BUT I WANT TO CALL CARRIER. YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE CALLING BUT IT'S SO MUCH FUN. I'LL GET CARL ICAHN TO CALL, SO MANY PEOPLE ENDORSING US. AND WE CALL CARRIER AND SAY ENJOY YOUR NEW PLANT AND I HOPE YOU HAVE GREAT SUCCESS BUT EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU MAKE A BEAUTIFUL AIR CONDITIONER AND YOU WANT TO SELL IT TO THE UNITED STATES, THERE'S GOING TO BE A 35% TAX ON THAT AIR CONDITIONER COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY.   >> OK? NOW A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES, YOU KNOW, THESE CHARACTERS THAT HAVE BEEN FIGHTING ME NEVER TRUMP, NEVER TRUMP, NEVER TRUMP. OH, THESE ARE PEOPLE -- HERE'S A GUY, YOU TALK ABOUT A GREAT CONSERVATIVE BUT HE GETS IT. SOME OF THESE PEOPLE DON'T GO IT. NEVER TRUMP. NEVER TRUMP IS DISAPPEARING RAPIDLY. YOU HEARD ABOUT THE 51 MILLION, ANYBODY? 51? RAISED $51 MILLION, RIGHT? $51 MILLION.   >> EVEN NEWT COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT, RIGHT, NEWT? $51 MILLION RAISED. OK. SO HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND I JUST STARTED REALLY -- LISTEN. SOUNDS LIKE A FOOTBALL GAME. NEWT, NEWT, NEWT. I DON'T KNOW, NEWT, ARE THEY BOOING OR ARE THEY SAYING NEWT? IT'S ONE OF THOSE NAMES, RIGHT? NO, THEY LOVE NEWT. THEY DO LOVE NEWT. WE ALL LOVE NEWT. NEWT GETS IT. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING, FOLKS. I'M NOT SAYING IT'S NEWT, BUT IF IT'S NEWT, NOBODY'S GOING TO BE BEATING HIM IN THOSE DEBATES, THAT'S FOR SURE, RIGHT? NOBODY. NOBODY'S BEATING ON NEWT IN THE DEBATES. YEAH. WE RAISED $51 MILLION AND ""THE WASHINGTON POST"" HAD A GOOD STORY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME AND GAVE A GREAT STORY. $51 MILLION. NOBODY CAN BELIEVE IT, AND I ONLY STARTED MID-JUNE BECAUSE THEY WERE BEATING ME UP. TRUMP WAS DOWN -- AND I'M RAISING THE MONEY FOR THE PARTY AND I'M PUTTING UP A LOT OF MY OWN MONEY, LIKE I PUT UP OVER 50 FOR THE PRIMARIES. I'M PUTTING UP A LOT OF MY OWN MONEY, BUT HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. FOLKS. HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. WE'RE GOING TO BE SO SUCCESSFUL, AND WHEN PEOPLE CALL ME, PUNDITS, PEOPLE RIGHT UP HERE IN THESE PLATFORMS, LOOK AT ALL THESE PEOPLE, I CAN'T STAND THEM, BUT LOOK, LOOK, ONE OF THEM CALLED WHO IS HERE TODAY AND SAID MR. TRUMP, WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS INCREDIBLE. SIR, THIS IS A PRETTY LIBERAL GUY. I WAS SURPRISED HE CALLED ME SIR ACTUALLY. WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE AND HONESTLY I SAID, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT SO INCREDIBLE. I HAVEN'T WON. THEY SAID, NO, NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WIN. WHAT YOU'VE DONE HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS. IT'S INCREDIBLE. I SAID LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE CLUE. IF I DON'T WINNING THE ONE PERSON LEFT THEN I'VE WASTED A LOT OF TIME AND A LOT OF MONEY. THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT IT. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO LOWER YOUR TAXES, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET YOU GOOD HEALTH CARE, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SAVE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT WHICH IS UNDER SIEGE, BY THE WAY, AND THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION, THE NRA, ENDORSED ME WITH THE EARLIEST ENDORSEMENT THEY HAVE EVER GIVEN TO A CANDIDATE, OK? AND HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY. SHE WANTS TO EFFECTIVELY ABOLISH THE SECOND AMENDMENT. THAT'S WHY THEY GAVE ME THE EARLY ENDORSEMENT BECAUSE SHE IS UNTHINKABLE FOR THE NRA. UNTHINKABLE. BUT ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN, SO LET ME JUST FINISH MY SAYING THE FOLLOWING. I LOVE OHIO. I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF OHIO. GO OUT AND VOTE FOR ROB PORTMAN. HE'S BEEN TERRIFIC. GO OUT AND VOTE FOR ROB, BUT I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF OHIO, AND WE'RE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN, FOLKS. WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE AS A COUNTRY. WE DON'T WIN ON TRADE. WE DON'T WIN WITH THE MILITARY. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS YOUNG, WE NEVER LOST A WAR, ALL OF US, A LOT OF YOU MY AGE. WHEN WE WERE YOUNG, I STILL FEEL YOUNG, DON'T YOU FEEL YOUNG? BUT -- BUT WHEN WE WERE YOUNG, WE NEVER LOST A WAR. THEY USED TO SAY WE'VE NEVER LOST A WAR. NOW WE NEVER WIN A WAR. WE NEVER WIN A BAT. WE NEVER WIN ANYTHING. WE HAVE THESE IDIOTS THAT GET ON TELEVISION SAYING WE ARE GOING TO ATTACK ISIS IN 48 HOURS AND WHEN WE ATTACK WE'RE GOING TO HIT THEM FROM THE REAR AND WE'RE GOING AFTER FALLUJAH AND THAT WILL TAKE PLACE IN EXACTLY TWO WEEKS AND AFTER THAT THANKS PLACE WE'RE GOING TO RAMADI AND WE WILL -- NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY SAY, OH, I MEAN, THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THEY CAN'T BE ANYBODY IS SO STUPID TO BE SAYING ALL SO SOMETIMES THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT AND WE CAN GET AWAY WITH IT. CAN YOU IMAGINE, NEWT, THE GREAT GENERAL GEORGE PATTON GETTING ON TELEVISION TO SAY WHEN WE'RE LEAVING IRAQ. WE ARE LEAVING ON THAT DATE SO THE ENEMY GOES BACK AND THEY SAY NOBODY CAN BE THAT STUPID TO SAY THAT. WE DON'T REALLY BELIEVE IT, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST IN CASE OBAMA IS SERIOUS, LET'S JUST PULL BACK. HEY, YOU KNOW. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE KILLED. YOU KNOW THEY TALK ABOUT THEY WANT TO BE KILLED, TRUST ME. THEY CAN LIVE. THEY WOULD RATHER LIVE. THEY WILL HAVE THEIR TIME. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? PULL BACK, PULL BACK. SO NOW THEY PULL BACK AND HE DIDN'T LEAVE ANYBODY BEHIND. I DIDN'T WANT TO GO INTO IRAQ FROM BEGINNING. I SAID YOU'RE GOING TO DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST, ONCE YOU GO IN, THE WAY HE GOT OUT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. DRAWS THE LINE IN THE SAND, THE LINE IN THE SAND. IT IS A VIOLATION. THE LINE IN THE SAND DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. NOTHING MEANS ANYTHING. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS TERRIBLE. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS -- WHO IS RIGHT NOW WHAT HE WANTS TO DO IS -- ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS CAMPAIGN. HE HAS FUN CAMPAIGNING. HE HAS A GOOD TIME CAMPAIGNING. I WANT A PRESIDENT THAT'S GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON KNOCKING THE HELL OUT OF ISIS. I WANT A PRESIDENT THAT'S GOING TO FOCUS ON MAKING GREAT TRADE DEALS SO THAT CHINA AND US, WE DON'T HAVE A $505 BILLION A YEAR TRADE DEFICIT. I WANT A PRESIDENT THAT'S GOING TO CREATE STRONG BORDERS AND I WANT A PRESIDENT THAT'S GOING TO KEEP CRIMINALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY AND PEOPLE THAT KILL US, PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING AROUND SHOOTING PEOPLE IN THE BACK. JAMEEL SHAW GREAT, SHOT IN THE FACE BY A PERSON WHO SHOULDN'T BE IN THIS COUNTRY. KATE, SAN FRANCISCO, SHOT IN THE BACK BY SOMEBODY THAT WAS THROWN OUT OF THE COUNTRY FIVE TIMES AND PROBABLY GOT FORCED BACK IN. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SAFE COUNTRY AGAIN, FOLKS, AND WE'RE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO WIN AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH, AND I'M TELLING YOU, AND I HAVE SAYING THIS, BUT THERE'S NOTHING FUN ABOUT IT BECAUSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON. BUT WE'RE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH THAT THE PEOPLE OF OHIO ARE GOING TO CALL YOUR REPRESENTATIVES. THEY ARE GOING TO CALL MATT BORGESS, HEAD OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, GOOD GUY, BY THE WAY. MATT, YOU BETTER WIN OHIO FOR ME, MATT. THEY ARE GOING TO CALL MATT. THEY ARE GOING TO CALL ROB. YOU'RE GOING TO CALL YOU HAVE TO SEE THE PRESIDENT. WE'RE WINNING TOO MUCH. WE'RE NOT USED TO WINNING THIS MUCH. WE'RE GOING TO WIN WITH OUR MILITARY. WE'LL KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS. WE'RE WINNING WITH THE VETS AND WITH HEALTH CARE AND WE'RE WINNING WITH THE BORDER AND WE'RE WINNING WITH THE WALL AND WE'RE WINNING ON OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. MR. PRESIDENT, SIR, YOU'RE WINNING TOO MUCH. THE PEOPLE OF OHIO CAN'T STAND SO MUCH WINNING. WE'RE NOT USED TO IT, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING TO SAY I DON'T CARE, ROB. I DON'T CARE, MATT, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP WINNING BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. I LOVE YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, OHIO. THANK YOU, CINCINNATI. I LOVE CINCINNATI.    [""YOU CAN'T ALWAYS","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Rally in Cincinnati, Ohio"

UNBELIEVABLE. IT IS INCREDIBLE THING. THE SYSTEM IS RATE BUT WE ARE STILL HAPPY TO BE TOGETHER. TOTALLY RIGGED. WHAT A SYSTEM. WHAT IS GOING ON, AND WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT IT BUT A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE, SOMEBODY RESPECTED BY EVERYBODY, SENATOR BOB CORKER. COME ON UP, BOB.   HE IS A GREAT PERSON. I HAVE TO TELL YOU A FEW THINGS. THE NUMBERS JUST CAME OUT. WERE DOING VERY WELL IN THE POLLS.  VERY VERY WELL. THE NUMBERS JUST CAME OUT AND DURING THE PRIMARY SYSTEM THE REPUBLICANS, I WONDER WHY, 62%. THE DEMOCRATS WERE DOWN 21%. THAT TELLS YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON. WHAT YOU WITNESSED TODAY AND OVER THE LAST WEEK. BILL CLINTON GOING TO THE AIRPLANE WHICH JUST HAPPENED TO BE THERE. I WONDER HOW LONG HE WAITED. AND THEN TO HAVE WHAT HAPPENED TODAY WERE ESSENTIALLY EVERYBODY THOUGHT SHE WAS GUILTY. THE TURNEDIT TURNED OUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO PRESS CHARGES. IT IS REALLY AMAZING. WE HAVE A RIGGED SYSTEM. I USED TO SAY THAT DURING THE PRIMARIES. I WON NORTH CAROLINA BIG LEAGUE BECAUSE OF YOU.    NOT ONLY DID THE REPUBLICAN PARTY GO WAY UP FROM WHAT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO BUT DONALD TRUMP IN THE HISTORY OF THE PRIMARIES WITH 17 PEOPLE RUNNING. I GOT ALMOST 14 MILLION VOTES. MORE THAN ANYBODY IN THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. MORE THAN RONALD REAGAN. MORE THAN THE BUSHES. MORE THAN RICHARD NIXON. MORE THAN DWIGHT EISENHOWER. HE WON THE SECOND WORLD WAR. WE HAVE THE HIGHEST VOTE COUNT IN THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THAT WAS SUCH A BIG THING FOR ME. 37 STATES. I JUST GOT STRONGER AND STRONGER. I THINK WE ARE STRONGER NOW THAN EVER BEFORE. WE ARE FIGHTING A VERY DISHONEST MEDIA. TO HAVE A PROTESTER? DO WE HAVE A PROTESTER?  WE LOVE OUR PROTESTERS DON'T WE? GOING TIME I GET THE CAMERAS TO TURN. THE ONLY TIME WE GET THOSE CAMERAS TO TURN. THIS IS REALLY GREAT. GET HIM OUT. THANK YOU. TAKE IT EASY. IF I CAN SPEAK TO THESE PEOPLE FOR A LITTLE WHILE, WHAT DO WE WANT? GOOD EDUCATION, A STRONG MILITARY, WE WANT THE WALL ON THE BORDER. WE WANT TO KEEP OUR JOBS IN NORTH CAROLINA.  WE WANT TO KEEP OUR JOBS IN NORTH CAROLINA. LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON FOLKS. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD THE WALL. WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL?  YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT. THEY WILL BE HAPPY TO PAY. IF THE WRONG PERSON LIKE HILLARY CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON ASKS, THEY WON'T. BUT SHE IS NEVER GOING TO ASK. WE LOOK FOR JOBS THAT HAVE LEFT NORTH CAROLINA AND GONE DOWN TO MEXICO. IT IS A DISGRACE. IT IS A DISGRACE WHAT HAS HAPPENED. WE ARE GOING TO STOP IT. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN ANY LONGER. WE'RE LOSING OUR JOBS. WE ARE LOSING OUR MANUFACTURING. WE ARE GOING TO STOP THE NONSENSE THAT IS GOING ON. IT IS SO EASY TO STOP. WE WILL STOP IT SO FAST YOUR HEADS WILL SPIN. REMEMBER THAT. YOUR HEADS WILL SPIN. WE WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TRADE LATER ON. WE ARE GOING TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS.  WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WAS OUT CAMPAIGNING FOR CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON. HE SHOULD BE HOME WORKING ON ISIS WHERE THE THREAT IS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE. HE SHOULD BE WORKING ON TRADE. HE SHOULD BE WORKING ON THE BORDERS. PEOPLE ARE FLOWING INTO OUR COUNTRY FROM LOTS OF PLACES. FROM SYRIA, NO MORE. THEY ARE NOT COMING. THEY HAVE NO DOCUMENTATION, NO PAPERWORK. WHO KNOWS? WE CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE CHANCES. WE CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE CHANCES. IF YOU LOOK AT CROOKED HILLARY, SHE WANTS TO INCREASE THE IMMIGRANTS COMING IN FROM SYRIA AGAIN. THEY COULD BE ISIS. THIS COULD BE THE ALL TIME GREAT TROJAN HORSE. YOU KNOW THE STORY OF THE TROJAN HORSE. LOOK AT WHAT ONE PERSON HAS DONE IN ORLANDO. JUST TAKE A LOOK. ONE PERSON. LOOK AT THE HORROR OF WHAT THAT ONE PERSON DEAD IN OUR COUNTRY. IN THE GAY COMMUNITY. THE LGBT COMMUNITY. BILLY CAN FATHOM WHAT TOOK PLACE. ONE BAD APPLE. WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE COMING IN. IT JUST TAKES A SMALL PERCENTAGE BUT THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON. GUESS WHAT? WE HAVE A LEADER THAT DOESN'T EVEN WANT TO DISCUSS THE NAME OF THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. IT IS A PROBLEM.    WE'VE GOT HILLARY CLINTON WHO IS INEFFECTIVE AND SHE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO THE JOB. HER JUDGMENT IS HORRIBLE. LOOK AT HER JUDGMENT ON THESE E-MAILS. WHO WOULD DO IT? LOOK AT HER JUDGMENT. HER JUDGMENT IS HORRIBLE. WHO SAID THAT ABOUT HILLARY? BERNIE SANDERS SAID HER JUDGMENT IS BAD. WHETHER IT IS ISIS, TRADE, BORDERS, JOBS, IT IS GOING TO BE FOUR MORE YEARS OF THE SAME THING. THE LAST THING WE NEED IS ANOTHER CLINTON OR THE LAST THING WE NEED IS ANOTHER OBAMA IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE HAVE $19 TRILLION IN DEBT. SOON TO BE $21 TRILLION. THE DEBT HAS DOUBLED UNDER OBAMA. IT HAS DOUBLED. WE ARE SITTING ON A MESS AND IT IS GOT A BE TAKEN CARE OF. THE WAY GETS TAKEN CARE OF AT LEAST THAT ASPECT OF IT. WE ARE GOING TO BRING JOBS BACK TO NORTH CAROLINA. WE ARE GOING TO BRING JOBS BACK TO OUR COUNTRY. IT IS GOING TO THE AMERICA FIRST. NOT ALL THESE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT DON'T GIVE A DAM ABOUT US. IT IS GOING TO BE AMERICA FIRST. AMERICA AMERICA, AMERICA FIRST.    WE GOT A PERSON IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS HAVING A LOT OF PROBLEMS. IT IS LIKE A CARNIVAL ACT. A LOT OF FUN. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO BRING US BACK. A PRESIDENT WHO IS NOT GOING TO BE DIVISIVE. A PRESIDENT WHO'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. REMEMBER THAT. OBAMA IS ALL TALK AND NO ACTION. WE NEED A PRESIDENT THAT IS GOING TO CREATE JOBS FOR HISPANICS WHO DON'T HAVE JOBS NOW. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO'S GOING TO TURN OUR COUNTRY AROUND AND HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE EVEN WORSE THAN OBAMA. I BROUGHT UP SOMETHING LAST NIGHT. I HEARD THEY WERE FLYING DOWN ON AIR FORCE ONE. AIR FORCE ONE IS A VERY OLD BILLING 747. IT SUCKS UP A LOT OF GAS. A LOT OF FUEL. THE FUEL BILL. YOU TURN ON THOSE ENGINES IS A LOT OF MONEY. WHY IS SHE CAMPAIGNING WITH THE PLANE OF THE UNITED STATES? WHY IS HE ALLOWED TO COME DOWN ON THAT VERY EXPENSIVE PLANE? HE TALKS ABOUT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT. HE WANTS TO SOLVE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT. HE GETS ON AN OLD BOEING 747 THAT IS SPEWING STUFF INTO THE AIR. HE GETS HER ON THE PLANE AND THEN HE SAYS WE WILL FIGHT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. THEN HE GETS BACK ONTO THE BOEING 747 GOES BACK TO WASHINGTON. THE GREATEST WAS WHAT HE WANTED TO PLAY GOLF IN HAWAII. SO HE TAKES THE 747. HE IS PLAYED MORE ROUNDS THAN JUST ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY PROFESSIONALLY ON THE PGA TOUR. HE GETS ON THIS PLANE AND FLY'S TO HAWAII, HE IS THERE FOR A LONG TIME. GOLF, GOLF, GOLF. MORE AND MORE. LEARNING HOW TO POTPUTT. OUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO HELL. ISIS IS LAUGHING AT US. THEY ARE CHOPPING OFF HEADS. THEY'RE DROWNING PEOPLE IN STEEL CAGES. HE IS OUT THERE PLAYING GOLF WITH JUST ABOUT AS LONG A TRIP AS YOU CAN MAKE FROM WASHINGTON. AFTER A LONG EXTENDED VACATION HE GETS BACK ON THE PLANE AND FLIES BACK AND LANDS AND STRESS TALKING ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT. GIVE ME A BREAK. GIVE ME A BREAK.  WE NEED UNITY IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I HAVE TO BE HONEST, I THINK I WIN WITHOUT THE UNITY. BUT WE NEED UNITY. FOR THE MOST PART WE HAPPENED. WE HAVE SOME GREAT PEOPLE LIKE BOB CORKER WHO JUST CAME UP. SO HE SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN. WE NEED REAL UNITY. THE UNITY HAVE TO GET SUPPORT. WE'RE GOING TO WIN ANYWAY. PROBABLY I WILL DO BETTER WITHOUT THE KIND OF SUPPORT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THAT IS WHY I'M HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.  THE CONVENTION IS GOING TO BE TERRIFIC. WE HAD GREAT SPEAKERS. SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO SPEAK. WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE. I'VE MADE SO MANY ENEMIES BY SAYING I CAN'T LET YOU DO IT. WE WANT PEOPLE WHO LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND WANT TO BE THERE. IF THEY DON'T LOVE THE PARTY, THEY SHOULD BE THERE. D  NOT BE THERE. WE HAVE TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY. DEFENSE IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT. WE HAVE TO BUILD UP OUR MILITARY. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. OUR VETERANS ARE BEING MISTREATED HORRIBLY. OUR GREATEST PEOPLE. WE HAVE A PLAN THAT HAS RECEIVED UNIVERSAL FANTASTIC REVIEWS. I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DO IT. I MADE A SPEECH. I SAID LET'S RAISE SOME MONEY FOR THE VETERANS. WE RAISED $5.6 MILLION FOR VETERANS. I GAVE $1 MILLION. I COULD JUST GIVEN A SPEECH AND LEFT. THE PRESS CAME DOWN AND SAID YOU SHOULD HAVE GIVEN HERE. WE HAVE TO CHECK THEM OUT. WE RAISED FIVE POINT $6 MILLION FOR THE VETERANS. I AM SO PROUD OF IT. I HAVE RECEIVED MORE ACCOLADES FROM THE VETERANS GROUPS THAT NEVER GOT MONEY BEFORE. IN ONE CASE $1.1 MILLION. ALL OF THESE GROUPS. IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL TO SEE. ALL OF US WE HAVE RECEIVED ACCOLADES. THIS IS A MOVEMENT. THIS IS NOT LIKE A NORMAL SITUATION. LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THIS ROOM. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND IT WAS RAINING AND WINDY. BUT THE PEOPLE CAME OUT ANYWAY. NOW YOU KNOW IT IS MY HAIR BECAUSE ANY HAIR THEY CAN WITHSTAND THAT WIN. IT IS MY HAIR. THE PILOT SAID SIR I WOULD WAIT ABOUT 10 OR 20 MINUTES. I SAID NO WE ARE NOT GOING TO KEEP THESE PEOPLE WAITING PERIODG. WE ARE TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I WILL TELL YOU I'M SO PROUD OF WHAT IS HAPPENING. IT IS A MOVEMENT. LIKE NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. I WATCHED BILL O'REILLY, A GOOD MAN, I AM ON TONIGHT. IS IT WAS GOOD WHEN THEY TAKE YOU BY TELEPHONE THAT MEANS YOU'RE HOT. I SAID I CAN'T DO IT I'M ON A PLANE TO NORTH CAROLINA. HOW ABOUT BY PHONE. WE DO PHONE INTERVIEWS TO FACE THE NATION. AND MEET THE PRESS. SO MUCH EASIER TO SIT HOME AND TALK ON THE PHONE. I WAS THE WORLD? HOW IS THE WORLD? IT IS A MOVEMENT. PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. PUNDITS WHO HATE ME, AND WE MADE THEM LOOK PRETTY BAD. THEY SAID HE WOULD  NOT RUN. THEY SAID HE WOULD HAVE FUN AND BUILD HIS BRAND. PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW WHO I AM. I LOST THE SHIRTS BECAUSE MACY'S WAS SO DISLOYAL. MACY'S DID NOT LIKE WHAT I'M SAYING ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. IT'S NOT THE MOST PROFITABLE THING I'VE EVER DONE DOING THIS. IT IS NICE WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO CARE. WHAT I CARE ABOUT IS MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THAT IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT.  THE APPRENTICE, THEY SAID THEY WANT TO RENEW IT FOR TWO MORE SEASONS. THEY SAID THAT WE WILL PAY YOU ANYTHING. 14 SEASONS OF THE APPRENTICE. I SAID TO THE HEAD PERSON AT COMCAST, I SAID STEVE I'M GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I SAID I AM GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. YOU CAN'T DO BOTH BECAUSE OF THE TIME RULES. IT TAKES GUTS TO DO WHAT WE ARE ALL DOING. IT TAKES GUTS TO DO WHAT I'M DOING. BELIEVE ME. IT TAKES GUTS. IT'S NOT EASY.  YOU GET HIT BY DISHONESTY AND NOT ALL REPORTERS ARE BAD. A LOT OF THEM ARE TERRIBLE. YOU GET HIT FROM 15 DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. STUFF THAT IS VERY UNFAIR. YOU GET HIT AND SONY DIFFERENT WAYS. IT STARTED OFF WITH 17 PEOPLE. THEN HE GETS DOWN TO ONE. THEY MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE. AM I DOING A GOOD JOB?  I AM JUST THE MESSENGER. I AM YOUR MESSENGER. THE MESSAGE IS SIMPLE. WE GOING TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EVERYBODY INCLUDED. WE WANT HELP AFRICAN-AMERICANS. WE WANT HELP HISPANICS AND LATINOS. HELPING EVERYBODY. WE WILL BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER. WE'VE GOT TO BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER. SO IMPORTANT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH ISIS AND THEY ARE BLOWING UP AIRPLANES. THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED SINCE MEDIEVAL TIMES. WE STUDIED HISTORY. I LOVE HISTORY. THEY ARE CHOPPING OFF HEADS. THAT IS MEDIEVAL. THESE ARE ANIMALS. THEY HAVE TO BE STOPPED.  I WAS AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ. IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. I WAS WAS AGAINST IT. I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO WAR IN IRAQ. I THINK YOU WILL DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST. WHO WOULD'VE KNOWN THIS WOULD HAPPEN? THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN LIVES AND OTHER LIVES LOST. OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. DESTROYED. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS WHERE THEY ARE WOUNDED. THE BRAVEST PEOPLE I'VE EVER SEEN. THEY HAVE THE BEST ATTITUDE. I WORK FOR THEM. THEY HAVE THE BEST ATTITUDE OF EVER SEEN. I NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. THEY HAVE A BETTER ATTITUDE ABOUT LIFE THAT I DO. AMAZING PEOPLE. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT. WE GOT ISIS ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE. NOW WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING. HE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE. INSTEAD OF SAYING THERE WITH US FAIRLY SMALL FORCE HE ANNOUNCES HE'S GOING TO TAKE EVERYBODY OUT AND THEY WILL BE OUT BY A CERTAIN DATE. THE ONLY THING THAT WAS SURPRISING WAS THE ENEMY DID BELIEVE HIM BECAUSE THEY SAID NOBODY COULD BE THAT STUPID TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE OUT ON A CERTAIN DATE. THEN THAT DATE CAME AND WE WERE GONE. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE. WE SHOULD HAVE DESTABILIZED THE REGION. SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS A BAD GUY. A REALLY BAD GUY. YOU KNOW HE DID WELL. HE KILLED TERRORISTS. HE DID THAT SO GOOD. HE THEN READ THEM THEIR RIGHTS. DID NOT READ THEM THEIR RIGHTS. THEY WERE GONE. TODAY IRAQ IS A HARBOR FOR TERRORISM. IT IS LIKE HARBOR TERRORISTS. IT IS LIKE HARVARD FOR TERRORISTS. SO SAD. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF IT. WE HAD A CHOICE. NO CHOICE. THEY OVERPLAY THEIR HAND. IF THEY DIDN'T, WE ARE ALL FOOLS. WE CANNOT LET THEM GET AWAY WITH WHAT THEY ARE DOING RIGHT NOW TERRORIZING PEOPLE. WE'RE GOING TO BE SO STRONG. WOULD IT BE SO VICIOUS. WE'RE GOING TO KNOCK THEM FOR A LOOP.  ROOTS OF NOTES COMINGI WROTE SOME NOTES COMING IN. WE ARE A COUNTRY OF LAWS. WE ARE A COUNTRY OF ORDER. OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SO BADLY HURT BY DOING THINGS SO MUCH LESS THAN CRICKET HILLARY CLINTON. CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON. SO WE PEOPLE OF SUFFERED SO GREATLY FOR DOING SO MUCH LESS. DOES THAT MEAN THAT WE EXPUNGE THEIR RECORD? WE SAY ALL OF YOU PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND GUILTY WE CAN NO LONGER ACCEPT THAT AS A RULING BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'VE DONE FOR HER. SHE WAS SO MUCH WORSE THAN ANYBODY THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. DOES THAT MEAN WE HAVE TO EXONERATE EVERYBODY? WE HAVE TO TAKE BACK THE PUNISHMENTS. WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE FAIR. WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT WAS SAID BY THE FBI DIRECTOR, YOU LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID. IN THE MIDDLE OF IT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. HE CALLS HER EXTREMELY CARELESS. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE CARELESS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SERIOUS STUFF. THE LIFEBLOOD OF OUR COUNTRY. THE SAFETY OF OUR PEOPLE. THE LAWS ARE VERY EXPLICIT. STUPIDITY IS NOT A REASON THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE INNOCENT.  I DON'T HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS STUPIDITY. EVEN STUPIDITY IS NOT A REASON. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE. TODAY IS THE BEST EVIDENCE EVER THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT OUR SYSTEM IS ABSOLUTELY TOTALLY RIGGED.  I USED THAT TERM WHEN I WAS RUNNING IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES. ALL OF A SUDDEN BECAME A HOT TERM. I WOULD WIN LOUISIANA. AND I WOULD FIND OUT I DIDN'T GET ENOUGH DELEGATES. PLACES LIKE COLORADO. WE WOULD WIN THE VOTE BUT WE FOUND OUT THAT WE DIDN'T GET THE DELEGATES. I USED THE WORD GREAT. RIGGED. IF I HAD WON BY A LANDSLIDE I WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW. I LEARNED ABOUT THE RIGGED SYSTEMS. BERNIE SANDERS STARTED USING IT. EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT IT. I ASKED A COUPLE OF POLITICAL PROS AND IT HASN'T BEEN A THING USED. THINK OF BERNIE SANDERS. THE ONE WITH THE MOST TO LOSE HIS BERNIE SANDERS BECAUSE HONESTLY HE WAS WAITING FOR THE FBI PRIMARY. HE JUST LOST TODAY. HE LOST IN THE FBI PRIMARY. POOR BERNIE. I FEEL SO BADLY FOR BERNIE. A LOT OF HIS SUPPORTERS ARE GOING TO BE VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE HE WAS RIGHT. HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT COUPLE OF THINGS. HE SAID THE SYSTEM WAS RIGGED. HE IS ALSO RIGHT ABOUT TRADE. OUR TRADE DEALS ARE A DISASTER. THEY ARE KILLING OUR JOBS. THEY ARE KILLING OUR FAMILIES. THEY ARE KILLING OUR INCOMES. PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR YOU, ARE MAKING LESS MONEY TODAY THAT THEY MADE 18 YEARS AGO EFFECTIVELY. AND THEY ARE WORKING TO JOBS AND SET OF ONE. THIS HORRIBLE STUPID OBAMACARE IS A KILLER WHICH IS GIVING THEM PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT WHEN THEY NEVER HAD PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT IN THEIR LIVES. THE PREMIUMS ARE THROUGH THE ROOF AND THE DEDUCTIBLES ARE SO HIGH THAT YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO USE IT UNLESS YOU DIE A VERY VICIOUS LONG SLOW DEATH. IT IS GOING TO EXPLODE IN 2017 ANYWAY. WE ARE GOING TO REPLACE IT BEFORE IT EXPLODES. WE ARE GOING TO REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING THAT IS GREAT AND LESS EXPENSIVE BOTH FOR YOURSELVES AND FOR THE COUNTRY. IT IS A HORROR SHOW. WHAT I'M HEARING ABOUT IT. IN TEXAS GOING THROUGH OBAMACARE. BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD RAISED 60% INCREASE IN PREMIUMS. I HEAR THAT ON NOVEMBER 1 AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE AN INCREASE ON OBAMACARE THAT IS GOING TO SET THIS COUNTRY IN MOTION. I MEAN MOTION IN A BAD WAY. WHAT OBAMA WANTS TO DO BECAUSE IT IS ACTUALLY ELECTION CHANGING. THE NUMBERS ARE BIGGER THAN TEXAS. THE NUMBERS ARE ASTRONOMICAL. WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS TAKE THOSE NUMBERS AND MOVE THEM FROM NOVEMBER 1 TWO ANY TIME AFTER THE ELECTION. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THEM GET AWAY WITH THAT.  AS I SAID TODAY IS THE BEST EVIDENCE WE'VE EVER SEEN THAT OUR SYSTEM IS RIGGED. HILLARY CLINTON PUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IN DANGER. AND BENGHAZI. AND PLENTY OF OTHER THINGS. IT WAS CONFIRMED TODAY THAT SHE ROUTINELY SENT CLASSIFIED E-MAILS ON INSECURE PRIVATE SERVER THAT COULD BE EASILY HACKED BY HOSTILE  AND WE LEARNED THAT PEOPLE SHE E-MAILED WERE HACKS, AND PROBABLY, DEFINITELY WERE HACKED BY THESE HOSTILE ACTORS. THESE WERE VERY BAD, BUT VERY SMART PEOPLE. A HELL OF A LOT SMARTER THAN WE HAVE IN WASHINGTON, I CAN TELL YOU.  OUR ENEMIES MAY HAVE A BLACK MALE FILE ON CROOKED HILLARY. AND THIS ALONE MEANS THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.   WE NOW KNOW, JUST WROTE THIS OUT, WE NOW KNOW THAT SHE LIED TO THE COUNTRY WHEN SHE SAID SHE DID NOT SEND CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ON HER SERVER. SHE LIED. SHE SENT VAST AMOUNTS OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION CLASSIFIED AS TOP-SECRET. TOP-SECRET. OK? AND THIS IS WHERE THEY SAID SHE WAS EXTREMELY CARELESS. AND FRANKLY, EISAI GROSSLY INCOMPETENT. SHE WILL BE SUCH A LOUSY PRESIDENT, FOLKS. SO SAD. OK, THE LIVES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE PUT AT RISK BY HILLARY CLINTON, SO THAT SHE COULD CARRY ON HER CORRUPT FINANCIAL DEALINGS, THAT IS PROBABLY WHY SHE DID NOT WANT PEOPLE TO SEE WHAT THE HELL SHE WAS DOING. SHE WENT TO EXTRAORDINARY LENGTHS TO CARRY OUT AN ENR ON-STYLE PURGE OF HER E-MAIL. 33,000 E-MAILS ARE MISSING, AND THEY SAY SHE IS FINE? AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TOLD YOU CANNOT REALLY GET RID OF AN E-MAIL. HAVE YOU HEARD THIS? WE HAVE THE REAL SUPER GENIUSES THAT KNOW THIS STUFF, AND THEY SAY WE CANNOT GET RID OF E-MAIL. WE DID NOT USE THEM, BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO USE THEM. SO, LIKE A CRIMINAL WITH A GUILTY CONSCIENCE, CLINTON HAD HER LAWYERS DELETE, DESTROY, AND WIPE AWAY FOREVER. EXCEPT, I STILL SAY THERE ARE GENIUSES THAT CAN FIND THEM, 30,000 E-MAILS. THIS, AGAIN, DISQUALIFIES HER FROM SERVICE. AND JUST THINK OF IT? I MEAN, HOW CAN YOU HAVE THIS?   WE KNOW NOW THAT THESE DELETIONS INCLUDED E-MAILS THAT WERE WORK-RELATED. ONE MORE BIG, FAT, BEAUTIFUL LIE BY CRICKET HILLARY. ANY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE WHO ENGAGES IN THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR WOULD BE BARRED FROM HANDLING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. AGAIN, THAT ALONE DISQUALIFIES HER. AND AGAIN, BERNIE SANDERS TALKED ABOUT BAD, BAD JUDGMENT. HE IS NOT HAPPY TONIGHT, FOLKS. IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS OVER FOR BURNING. E. BUT I HAVE A FEELING THEY WILL HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE MARCHING ON PHILADELPHIA. LET US SEE. LET US SEE.   I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I ALWAYS FELT THAT HILLARY CLINTON WOULD ESCAPE CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR HER DANGEROUS AND ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR. BECAUSE I ALWAYS KNEW, AND I ALWAYS SEE AND IT IS SO SAD, THAT OUR SYSTEM IS IN FACT RIGGED. IT IS TOTALLY RIGGED. IT IS CORRUPT, RATE, TOTALLY DISGRACEFUL. YOU HAVE A STATEMENT MADE TODAY AT 11:00, THEN YOU HAVE A BIG SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT, FLYING IN ON AIR FORCE ONE WITH HILLARY CLINTON A FEW HOURS LATER. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE HERE THAN THEY DO, BUT WE WON'T SAY THAT.   SO, THE AG MET WITH THE PRESIDENT BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT. AND HOW ABOUT THAT? MET WITH PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON. HOW ABOUT THAT DEAL, RIGHT? HE IS WAITING AROUND, WAITING AT THE AIRPORT. LOOK, THE AG IS COMING. LET ME SAY HELLO. 39 MINUTES. THEY HAVE GRANDCHILDREN, TWO. I HEAR THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL. GOT TWO. NOW, I HAVE EIGHT GRANDCHILDREN. AND I WILL TELL YOU, I CAN TALK ABOUT THEM. AFTER, I SAY ISN'T SHE BEAUTIFUL? I LOVE THE KIDS. BUT AFTER ABOUT A MINUTE, I CAN GO MUCH LONGER.   I WANT TO GET THE BUSINESS, FOR YOU. HE DID NOT TALK ABOUT IT. THEY TALKED ABOUT GOLF. THE GRANDKIDS, I WOULD SAY THAT TAKES ANYWHERE FROM 30 SECONDS TO A MINUTE. SERIOUSLY. AND I WRITE? HOWRIGHT? HOW LONG CAN YOU TALK? THIS ATTORNEY GENERAL, I HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GRANDCHILDREN YOU EVER SEEN. LET ME SHOW YOU A PICTURE. ISN'T THAT GREAT? LET ME SHOW YOU ANOTHER. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.   AND THEY'RE SMART AND GREAT. NOW, HE IS STARTING TO RUN OUT OF WORDS. THAT IS 30 SECONDS.    NOW HE IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT GOLF. I KNOW MORE ABOUT GOLF AND HE DOES. YOU CANNOT TALK ABOUT GOLF THAT LONG. JEFF NICHOLAS IS THE GREATEST -- JACK NICHOLAS IS THE GREATEST, RIGHT? WHEN IS TIGER WOODS COMING BACK? ADAM SCOTT IS THE GREATEST. PHIL MICKELSON, YOU CAN'T TALK MUCH LONGER. A COUPLE OF MINUTES, OK? I DON'T THINK THEY WENT OVER THE SWING, THE TECHNIQUE, OR ANYTHING. THE AIRPLANE IS TOO SMALL. RIGHT?    SO, SO, GIVE THE GRANDCHILDREN TWO MINUTES. GIVE THE GOLF THREE-AND-A-HALF MINUTES. THAT IS A LONG TIME TO BE SITTING THERE TWIDDLING YOUR THUMBS. WHAT ELSE ARE WE GOING TO TALK ABOUT? LET US TALK ABOUT HILLARY. LET US TALK ABOUT HILLARY. DID YOU SEE TODAY? HILLARY ANNOUNCED THAT SHE MAY CONSIDER THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, I'M NOT CASTING ASPERSIONS ON ANYBODY OTHER THAN HILLARY, OF COURSE, BUT SHE MAY CONSIDER THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, NOW THEY ARE ROLLING ON THE CASE, TO CONTINUE FORWARD AS ATTORNEY GENERAL. NOW, HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT STATEMENT WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO RULE? NUMBER WHAT HAPPENS. THE FBI MAKES A RECOMMENDATION, STILL UP TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. AT LEAST ACCORDING TO WHAT I SAW ON TELEVISION, WHICH YOU CANNOT ALWAYS BELIEVE, AND I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE, BUT SHE SAID TODAY WE MAY CONSIDER THE ATTORNEY GENERAL GOING FORWARD. THAT IS LIKE A BRIBE, ISN'T IT? I THINK IT IS A BRIBE.   I MEAN, IF SHE WINS, SHE WILL CONSIDER EXTENDING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM NOT KNOCKING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT? IT IS A BRIBE. I MEAN, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SITTING THERE SAYING, YOU KNOW, AS I GET HENRY OFF THE HOOK,  I WILL HAVE FOUR OR EIGHT MORE YEARS. IT IS A BRIBE. IT IS A DISGRACE. IT IS A DISGRACE. SHE IS LAUGHING AT THE STUPIDITY OF OUR SYSTEM. SHE IS LAUGHING, AND SO IS HER HUSBAND BILL, LAUGHING AT WHAT IS GOING ON. BECAUSE, THEY HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE, YOU KNOW IT, BETWEEN WHITEWATER AND THE OTHERS. SHE DID BETTER WITH CATTLE PROPORTIONALLY THAN PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WITH CATTLE WHO HAVE MADE MILLIONS. SHE MADE MILLIONS, AND YOU NEVER DID BEFORE. I WONDER HOW THAT HAPPENED? SHE IS CRICKET HILLARY -- CROOKED HILLARY, FOLKS. AND NOW, WITH ALL OF THAT GOING ON, YOU HAVE OBAMA CAMPAIGNING. AND THIS WAS SET UP A LONG TIME AGO, AND HE KNEW THAT THE FBI WAS GOING TO DO THIS, BECAUSE IT WOULD'VE BEEN VERY UNCOMFORTABLE OR HIM TO CAMPAIGN WITH HER ACTUALLY IF THEY DID NOT TAKE A PASS ON CROOKED HILLARY. THEY TAKE A PASS, ANNOUNCED THEY ARE NOT GOING TO PRESS CHARGES. LO AND BEHOLD A FEW HOURS LATER, LET US HAVE US PRESS CONFERENCE, LET US DO IS BE TOGETHER. BY THE WAY, HER SPEECH WAS TERRIBLE. I WATCHED IT. HOW BORING WAS THAT SPEECH? DO WE LIKE TRUMP BETTER? TO BE LIKE FROM  NOW, LET ME JUST TELL YOU, LET ME JUST TELL YOU, BECAUSE THE WORD TEMPERAMENT COMES TO YOU. SHE SAYS HE IS A VERY STRONG TEMPERAMENT. CHOPPING OFF HEADS, LOSING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO THE SAVAGE PEOPLE, RIGHT? WE NEED SOMEONE WITH A TOUGH TEMPERAMENT. IT IS TIME. IT IS TIME.   AND I WILL TELL YOU, WHETHER IT IS ON TRADE OR MILITARY OR AT THE BORDER, THE LAST PERSON THESE OTHER COUNTRIES WANT TO SEE AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE I WOULD BE FIGHTING FOR YOU NOT FIGHTING FOR THEM, GOING TO BE FIGHTING FOR YOU, IS DONALD J. TRUMP. THE LAST PERSON.   SO, THE LAST ONE.    SO A VERY AMAZING PRODIGIOUS MAN, I WILL NOT USE HIS NAME BUT PEOPLE KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT, I WAS AT HIS HOUSE. AND HE SAID DONALD, I THOUGHT YOU WERE TOTALLY WRONG. I THOUGHT YOU WERE MUCH TOO TOUGH ON CHINA. I THOUGHT YOU WERE MUCH TOO TOUGH ON JAPAN. I THOUGHT YOU WERE MUCH TOO TOUGH ON MEXICO. AND ALL OF THESE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT YOU ARE TALKING TO, WITH RESPECT, BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE MUCH TOO TOUGH. AND FOR A YEAR, I HAVE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE HE IS BEING TOO TOUGH. I THOUGHT YOU WERE MUCH TOO TOUGH DONALD COME ON SAUDI ARABIA. MUCH TOO TOUGH. I THOUGHT YOU WERE MUCH TOO TOUGH ON JAPAN, BECAUSE AS YOU NEVER KNEW BEFORE I GOT INVOLVED, WE PAY FOR A BIG PORTION OF JAPAN'S MILITARY. AND I WANT THEM TO HELP US OUT. THIS ISN'T 40 YEARS AGO. THIS IS IN 30 YEARS AGO. THEY ARE SENDING CARS TO US BY THE MILLIONS. AND BELIEVE ME, WE DON'T NEED MORE IRAN DEALS DONE BY INCOMPETENT PEOPLE. WE NEED SMART PEOPLE, GREAT NEGOTIATORS. AND BELIEVE ME, I WILL HEAD UP. I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. WE HAVE THE GREATEST NEGOTIATORS IN THE WORLD, AND WE DON'T USE THEM. WE USE POLITICAL HACKS. SO, WE TAKE CARE OF JAPAN. AND WE TAKE CARE OF GERMANY, AND WE TAKE CARE OF LOTS OF PLACES, SOUTH KOREA. WE HAVE 28,000 SOLDIERS ON THE LINE BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA. SOUTH KOREA, OR A TELEVISION. SEE IF YOU CAN BUY ONE IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU KNOW THE ANSWER IS? YOU CANNOT. ORDER MANY OTHER THINGS. SEE IF YOU CAN BUY THEM. WHO JUST MOVED TO MEXICO FROM INDIANA, THE GREAT STATE OF INDIANA THAT GAVE ME ANOTHER VICTORY, RIGHT? CARRIER. THE WE DON'T MAKE THAT ANYMORE. SO, CARRIER IS MOVING. BY THE WAY, I WOULD TELL THE PEOPLE OF CARRIER, LOVE YOU PEOPLE. EVERY TIME YOU MAKE AN AIR-CONDITIONING UNIT AND ENJOY YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACTORY, YOU WILL NOW SEND IT THROUGH THE STRONG AND SECURE BORDER, AND YOU ARE GOING TO PAY 35% TAXES. YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY ARE NOT LEAVING FOLKS. THEY ARE NOT LEAVING. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE. NOW, HILLARY CLINTON -- AND I WILL TELL YOU, THE PRESS DOES NOT TREAT IT ONE PERSON ACTUALLY AT THE NEW YORK TIMES DAVID SANGER TREATED IT RIGHT. ALONG WITH MAGGIE. ABOUT 82% ACCURATE. BUT I MENTION THIS ALL THE TIME, AND THE PRESS WILL GO, DONALD TRUMP ONCE JAPAN TO GO NUCLEAR. I DID NOT SAY THAT. YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED ALWAYS IN A DEAL TO WALK. FOR INSTANCE, WITH A HORRIBLE DEAL WE MADE WITH IRAN, THE HORRIBLE DEAL, THE INCOMPETENT DEAL, KERRY SHOULD PICKED UP AND WALKED A COUPLE OF TIMES. HE SHOULD'VE WALKED WHEN THEY SAID THEY WILL NOT GIVE BACK OUR HOSTAGES, UNTIL THE DEAL IS OVER. AND THEN HE SHOULD'VE WALKED, DOUBLED UP THE SANCTIONS, AND BY THE TIME ELATED BACK IN THE UNITED STATES THEY COULD'VE TURNED THE PLANE AROUND HER YOU WOULD HAVE A HOSTAGES BACK. INSTEAD OF WAITING HERE.  , AND HE SHOULD'VE SAID ONE OTHER THING, FOLKS. WE GAVE THEM BACK $150 BILLION. I WOULD'VE SAID, MY FATHER USED TO SAY, SON, SOFT, NICE AND EASY. GOOD BUILDER. HE LOVED TO BUILD HOUSES, I LEARNED SO MUCH FROM THEM, AND HE WAS A GREAT GUY. LOVE THE GUY, MY FATHER. HE IS TO SAY SON, YOU ARE TOO TOUGH. TAKE THE LUMP SUM. IN THE OLD DAYS I WOULD'VE SAID WE ARE NOT GIVING YOU THE $150 BILLION. AND THEY WOULD'VE BEEN ANGRY AND WE WOULD'VE BEEN UPSET, AND WE WOULD NOT SAY THAT THAT WAY ANYMORE. MY FATHER TAUGHT ME WELL. I WOULD SAY FELLAS, AND IT IS ALL FELLAS BY THE WAY. THEY HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT THE WOMEN ARE SMARTER THAN THE MEN. THEY WILL IT WILL TAKE ABOUT 150-200 YEARS, AND THEY WILL FIGURE IT OUT. THEN WE ARE REALLY IN TROUBLE CAN YOU IMAGINE? BECAUSE THE PERSIANS ARE GREAT NEGOTIATORS, THEY OUT NEGOTIATED US. GIVE ME A FAVOR. WE HAVE A BAD BUDGET THAT WAS JUST PAST, THE OMNIBUS BUDGET DISASTER. $21 TRILLION IN DEBT. WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. I AM SORRY. I APOLOGIZE. I WON'T BE ABLE TO PULL IT OFF. I'M NOT GOING TO BE A BOOK TO GIVE YOU THE $150 BILLION. LIKE, I CAN'T DO IT. I WANT TO DO IT, SO BADLY. AND YOU ARE RIGHT, YOU SHOULD GET IT. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY, I AM SORRY. AND THEY WILL GO CRAZY. AND WE LEAVE, WE SAY HELL WITH HIM, DOUBLE OF THE SANCTIONS, AND THEY WILL DROP THE $150 BILLION SANCTIONS. WE HAVE GREAT AMATEURS DEALING FOR US. I HAVE THE GREAT BUSINESSMEN IN THE WORLD, CARL ICAHN. RIGHT NOW, I SAY IT IS $5 TRILLION. THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS $3 TRILLION. BUT IT IS A LOT. IN OTHER AREAS, PROCESSES, THAT WE WANT TO BRING BACK. MY TAX PLAN, WHICH CUTS TAXES FOR EVERYBODY, AND PUTTING BUSINESSES AND MIDDLE-CLASS IN PARTICULAR, IT CUTS TAXES.   WE ARE TO BRING THAT MONEY BACK AND WILL BE SPENT IN THE U.S. YOU HAVE CORPORATE INVERSIONS. YOU HAVE COMPANIES LEAVING THE UNITED STATES, TOGETHER MONEY, THEY CAN'T GET IT BACK. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. RADICALLY AND THE TAXES, THE ONLY PERSON THAT IS REALLY, REALLY DUMB WOULD SAY SEND IT BACK. SO THEY LEAVE THE MONEY OVER THERE. AND IN MOVE THE COMPANY TO THE MONEY. DID YOU EVER HEAR OF THAT ONE BEFORE? IT IS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE PLACE. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON. IT IS GOING TO END. ONE OF THE HIGHEST TAX NATIONS, IN THE WORLD WE ARE CUTTING THE RIDICULOUS REGULATIONS WHICH ARE DESTROYING OUR BUSINESSES, DESTROYING OUR BUSINESSES.   AND WE ARE GOING TO DO IT, OK. SO, JUST TO FINISH, BECAUSE I'M SO PROUD OF WHAT I WROTE, I HAVE TO READ IT. I LOVE IT. I ACTUALLY LOVE WRITING. HE WILL DON'T REALIZE. YOU KNOW HOW MANY NUMBER ONE BESTSELLERS IPAD? HAVE HAD. ""THE ART OF THE DEAL,"" I LOVE IT. THE QUESTION THAT REALLY HAS TO BE ASKED IS THIS, WHAT IS HILLARY CLINTON'S MOTIVE? TO THAT, I SAY WHO CARES? SHE PUT IS IN DANGER. AND SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT IS CORRUPT FINANCIALLY, I DON'T CARE. WHAT HER MOTIVE IS, ALL I KNOW SHE HAD A MOTIVE, BUT HE IS ERASED SO MANY E-MAILS, WE WILL NEVER FIND OUT, OK? BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON RATE IN MILLIONS OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENT INTEREST AND NATIONAL CORPORATIONS, IN EXCHANGE FOR FAVORS, FOLKS. SHE IS CROOKED HILLARY, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? ONE OF THE MOST CROOKED POLITICIANS IN HISTORY. THESE ENTITIES EITHER FUNNEL MONEY INTO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, OR PAID BILL CLINTON LAVISHLY FOR SPEECHES, PAID A FORTUNE. AT LEAST 60 COMPANIES THAT LOBBIED THE STATE DEPARTMENT DURING CLINTON'S TENURE AS SECRETARY OF STATE DONATED A TOTAL OF $26 MILLION TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION. OK, $26 MILLION. AND SHE IS DEALING WITH THESE COUNTRIES. BILL CLINTON, AND BY THE WAY, MANY OF THESE COUNTRIES TREAT WOMEN AND WANT TO ENSLAVE WOMEN, AND THEY TREAT THEM HORRIBLY, AND AS FAR AS THE GAY COMMUNITY, THEY PUSH THEM OFF BUILDINGS, AND THEY KILLED HIM, AND THEY EXECUTE THEM. AND SHE HAS TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THESE COUNTRIES. BELIEVE ME, I AM BETTER FOR THE GAY COMMUNITY. I AM BETTER FOR WOMEN, THEN SHE WILL EVER BE, ON HER BEST DAY. ON HER BEST DAY.   BILL CLINTON WAS PAID A FORTUNE TO DELIVER A SPEECH IN MOSCOW, RUSSIA, WHILE HILLARY CLINTON WAS IN CHARGE OF THE RUSSIAN REST, ANOTHER DISASTER. BILL CLINTON WAS PAID MONEY BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT, A LOT, AND ITS SUPPORTERS, WHILE HILLARY HANDLED CHINA POLICY. AND DURING THIS TIME, CHINA WAS STEALING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN UNITED STATES INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. OK, FOLKS, WE COULD GO ON FOREVER. ABC NEWS SAID THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON ACCEPTED SPEAKING FEES FROM NUMEROUS COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS, WITH INTEREST PENDING BEFORE HILLARY CLINTON'S STATE DEPARTMENT. OH, THAT IS NICE. INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CONCEPTS, GOVERNMENT CORPORATIONS INVOLVED IN THE ARMS DEAL, APPROVED BY CLINTON'S STATE DEPARTMENT HAVE DELIVERED, LISTEN TO THIS, HER STATE DEPARTMENT IS APPROVING DEALS, HAVE DELIVERED BETWEEN 54-141 MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, AS WELL AS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN PAYMENTS TO THE CLINTON FAMILY. THEN, WHEN HILLARY LEFT THE STATE DEPARTMENT, SHE WAS PAID $21.6 MILLION FOR SPEECHES DELIVERED IN LESS THAN TWO YEAR. THAT IS NOT BAD. AND SHE IS A BORING SPEAKER, TERRIBLE.    THINK WHAT I CAN MAKE. MAN, SHE IS A TERRIBLE SPEAKER. SHE GOT $21.6 MILLION FOR BEACHES. AND SHE REFUSES, BECAUSE BERNIE SANDERSBETTER THAN ANYBODY, SHE REFUSES TO GIVE UP THE TEXT. AND I UNDERSTAND MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HER SUPPORTERS. AND BY THE WAY, MANY ARE FRIENDS OF MINE. AND THEY'RE GOING TO OWN HER, FOLKS. DON'T FORGET, ICE TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATION. I USED TO BE ESTABLISHED. AND ON JUNE 16, I RAN. HE IS NO LONGER ESTABLISHED. HE DOESN'T NEED OUR MONEY. THAT IS TERRIBLE. AND I PUT UP $55 MILLION, APPROXIMATELY IN THE PRIMARY, AND WON, BIG-LEAGUE.  AND I'M PUTTING UP MONEY NOW, AND I'M RAISING MONEY FOR THE PARTY. IT IS GOOD, REALLY GOOD. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THIS COUNTRY BACK FROM THESE THIEVES, C ANDROOKS, AND THESE HORRIBLE PRESIDENTS. AND I MEAN WHEN I SAY THAT OBAMA CAN TAKE ALL OF HIS TIME OFF, HE IS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND DEVICES AS AN EXAMPLE, WHEN HE CAN TAKE ALL OF THAT TIME OFF TO SPEND IT WITH HILLARY CLINTON, WITH THE SEAL OF THE PRESIDENT IN FRONT AS SHE STANDS THERE, SHE DOES NOT LOOK PRESIDENTIAL TO ME, FOLKS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT. SHE DOES NOT LOOK PRESIDENTIAL TO ME.   HILLARY ALSO HAD REASON TO HIDE HER FOREIGN-POLICY DISASTERS, AND THE DECISIONS THAT WENT INTO THEM. HER PUSH FOR REGIME CHANGE IN LIBYA, EGYPT, AND SYRIA HAS BEEN A TOTAL AND COMPLETE DISASTER. HER IRAQ POLICY HAS BEEN CATASTROPHIC. SHE HAS UNLEASHED ISIS ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST, WITH HER BAD DECISIONS AND HER BAD JUDGMENT. AND SHE IS GOING TO DO NOTHING ABOUT IT, BECAUSE SHE IS A WEAK PERSON. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH. AND SHE DOES NOT HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT, BELIEVE  THERE ARE GOING TO BE MORE OF THE SAME, FOLKS. MORE OF THE SAME. IN 2009, BEFORE HE TOOK OFFICE, LIBYA WAS COOPERATING. SYRIA WAS UNDER CONTROL. IRAQ WAS SEEING A REDUCTION IN VIOLENCE. AND I RAN WAS BEING CHOKED, ABSOLUTELY CHOKED, FINANCIALLY. THEY WERE DYING. NOW, AFTER SHE LEFT, ISIS CONTROLS HUGE PORTIONS OF IRAQ. SYRIA AND LIBYA COMMITTING UNSPEAKABLE, INHUMAN ATROCITIES AND TRY TO LAUNCH ATTACKS AGAINST THE WEST. IRAN, MEANWHILE, HAS BEEN PLACED ON THE PATH OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, AND BECOME A TRUE POWER, THEY HAVE BECOME A TRUE POWER IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND BEYOND. THEY WERE NOT A POWER. WE GAVE THEM POWER WITH THAT HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE DEAL. SO, HILLARY CLINTON'S POLICIES HAVE SPREAD ISIS AND MADE IRAN THE DOMINIC ISLAMIC POWER -- THE DOMINANT ISLAMIC POWER. HILLARY CLINTON CAN I KEEP HER E-MAIL SAFE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLK? SHE SURE AS HELL CAN I KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE. CAN'T DO IT.   SO, I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF NORTH CAROLINA. IT HAS BEEN SUCH AN AMAZING, SUCH AN AMAZING RUN FOR ME.   SUCH AN AMAZING RUN. WE GOT A LOT OF GOOD TIMES, IS THAT A LOT OF FUN, SPEECHES, SERIOUSLY. LOOK, WE NEED TO CHANGE. NOT A VOMITING. THE NUMBERREMEMBER OBAMA CHANGE? I ACTUALLY THOUGHT HE WOULD BE A CHEERLEADER, AND HE IS REALLY TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY DIVISIVE PERSON. WE NEED CHANGE. AND I HATE TO USE THE TERM, BUT WE REALLY DO NEED CHANGE. WE NEED FRESH, TOUGH, BOLD IDEAS. WE NEED PEOPLE THAT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. WE NEED PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT POLITICAL CORRECTNESS. WE CANNOT USE THAT TERM. WE CAN'T USE THAT TERM.  MR. TRUMP: AND I WATCHED OBAMA A WEEK AGO SPEND A WHOLE SPEECH ON WHY HE SHOULD NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO SAY RADICAL ISLAM, WHY HE SHOULDN'T DO IT. THAT IS WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, AND HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW IT. I DON'T EVEN THINK HE KNOWS, HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK HE HAS A CLUE. I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON, OK? AND YOU KNOW, IS A VERY INTERESTING THING. BUT I WAS WATCHING YESTERDAY, AND EVERYBODY SAYING ISIS, I SIS, ISIS. NOW, YOU CAN HAVE YOUR DEFINITION, HAS TO DO WITH TERRITORY. AND WE CAN GIVE YOU DEFINITION BETWEEN ISIS AND SISISIL. AND EXCEPT HIM, HE SAYS ISISL. L. ISIL IS BEING DRIVEN BACK, THE JV. IF THAT IS THE JV, I SURE AS HELL DON'T WANT TO SEE THE VARSITY. DO NOT WORRY. THEY WILL ABOUT A FIRST GRADE PRECISION, FOLKS. AND YOU KNOW, IT IS A MOST LIKE HE DOES IT TO MAKE PEOPLE UNHAPPY. I HAD SO MAYBE WILL SAY WHY DOESN'T HE SAY ISIS, FORGETTING ABOUT DEFINITION. AND ACTUALLY, FRIENDS OF MINE SAY ISIS IS ACTUALLY WORK ACCURATE. BE SO NICE, DON'T SAY ISIL. AND ISIL WILL BE DRIVEN BACK. IN THE MEANTIME, IT IS A DISASTER. IT IS TOTALLY A DISASTER. REMEMBER THIS, I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE, OUR MILITARY IS DEPLETED AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED A STRONG MILITARY. WE ARE GOING TO WIN NORTH CAROLINA.   WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF THESE FALLS,OOLS THE RUNNING OUR COUNTRY. THEY ARE FOOLS.   WE ARE NOT GOING TO GO FOUR MORE YEARS, THAT EVEN THE FBI TODAY TALKS SO HORRIBLY ABOUT, THIS PERSON. TO A POINT WHERE YOU SAY, HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY SAY NO CHARGES? WHAT THEY SAID, AND WHAT HE SAID TODAY WAS SO BAD. HERE IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. WE'RE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH, YOU ARE GOING TO BE SO SICK OF WINNING. YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO ANGRY AT ME. GOING TO BE SO ANGRY.   YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR LIEUTENANT GOVERNORS HERE, YOUR HEAD OF THE SUPREME COURT HERE, THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. WHERE ARE THEY? ARE THEY AROUND HERE? STAND UP. COME ON, STAND UP. BEAUTIFUL. THESE ARE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE. GREAT REPUTATION. I WILL TELL YOU, OUTSIDE OF NORTH CAROLINA THEY HAVE GREAT REPUTATIONS, OK? AND YOU ARE LUCKY TO HAVE THEM. WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN. WHERE GOING TO WIN AT EVERY LEVEL OUR MILITARY, TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS, AND WE ARE REALLY GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS. AND IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF MONEY, IS A QUESTION OF COMPETENCE. WE ARE SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY, AND IT IS A CORRUPT ENTERPRISE. THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION, LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON IN ARIZONA WITH THE VA, IT IS A CORRUPT ENTERPRISE. SO, WE ARE TO START WINNING. WE'RE GOING TO WIN ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET PEOPLE TAKE OUR GUNS AWAY.   WE ARE GOING TO TERMINATE COMMON CORE OUT OF WASHINGTON. WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUR EDUCATION LOCAL, LOCAL. SO, WE CAN HAVE OUR LOCAL PEOPLE, WHO LOVE OUR CHILDREN AND REALLY UNDERSTAND OUR CHILDREN, GIVE THEM THE KIND OF EDUCATION THAT WE WANT.   WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE, SO QUICKLY. SO QUICKLY.   WE ARE GOING TO CREATE STRONG, STRONG BORDERS. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD OUR WALL.WE ARE GOING TO STOP DRUGS FROM FLOWING INTO OUR COUNTRY, LIKE WATER. IT IS FLOWING INTO OUR COUNTRY LIKE WATER. WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR STATES, GOING TO PROTECT OUR YOUTH AND OTHERS FROM THE DRUGS THAT ARE FLOWING THROUGH. THE SOUTHERN BORDER.   WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THE GREATEST TRADE DEALS ANYONE HAS EVER MADE. WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR JOBS BACK. WE'RE GOING TO BRING MANUFACTURING BACK. WE ARE GOING TO OTHER COUNTRIES. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET COUNTRIES COME IN AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US, TAKE OUR COMPANIES OUT, SELL THEIR GOODS WITH NO TAXES, KNOW NOTHING. AND THEN WHEN OUR MANUFACTURES WANT TO GO TO CHINA AND OTHER PLACES TO SELL THEIR GOODS, THEY CANNOT GET THEIR INTO THE GOODS INTO THE COUNTRY. AS THE CHINESE SAY THEY DON'T WANT OUR GOODS, AND THEY DON'T STEEL, ALUMINUM. AND THEY DESTROY OUR FACTORIES. THEY DESTROY SO MUCH. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLKS? WE ARE TO DO OUR OWN PRODUCTS, LARGELY, AGAIN. LET ME TELL YOU, AND I AM NOT FOR ISOLATION, THIS IS ONLY IF THEY DO NOT BEHAVE. BUT THEY DEVALUE THEIR CURRENCY. THE MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR COMPANIES TO COMPETE. EVERY TIME WE START TO DO WELL, THERE IS COUNTRIES THAT ARE GRANDMASTERS, THEY START DEVALUING THEIR CURRENCY. AND OUR COUNTRY GOES FROM OH, I AM FEELING GOOD TODAY. TWO IT IS CHEATING. IT IS A BIG FORM OF CHEATING. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR MANUFACTURERS, AND WE ARE GOING TO START MAKING PRODUCTS AGAIN. AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. WE MAY PAY A LITTLE MORE FOR THE PRODUCT, BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ALL OF THOSE JOBS THAT MAKE THE PRODUCT. IN THE LONG RUN, WE ARE TO BE MUCH BETTER OFF. MUCH BETTER OFF.   AND A LOT OF THAT WILL COME BACK. AND AGAIN, NO ISOLATION. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE FAIR TRADE, FREE-TRADE. ONE OF THESE PEOPLE SITTING RIGHT UP THERE, WHAT DO YOU DO?  FOLKS, WE'RE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN. YOU ARE GOING TO BE SO SICK OF ME. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THE JUSTICE CALL ME, LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR AND THE GOVERNOR CALL ME, AND SAY MR. PRESIDENT, THE PEOPLE OF NORTH CAROLINA ARE SICK AND TIRED OF WINNING. YOU ARE WINNING TOO MUCH. THEY ARE REALLY STARTING TO DISLIKE YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. AND I WILL TELL THE JUSTICE, AND I WILL TELL THE GOVERNOR AND LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, I AM SORRY. WE HAVE TO KEEP WINNING. BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I LOVE YOU, NORTH CAROLINA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU.   ","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Rally in Raleigh, North Carolina"

THERE THAT HAVE TO GET IN --  THERE ARE 3000 PEOPLE THAT HAVE  TO GET IN. YES. THIS IS THE BIGGEST CROWD OF THE  POLITICAL SEASON SO FAR. WE HAVE 30,000 PEOPLE. AMAZING. 30,000 PEOPLE.

WE ARE GOING TO KEEP THAT RIM GOING -- THAT SPACE PROGRAM  GOING. WE WILL DO A LOT OF CUTTING, BUT WE WILL  KEEP THAT. I'VE GOT TO SAY, THE BENGHAZI GUYS, SO INCREDIBLE. GUTS, COURAGE, AMAZING GUYS. I WANT TO THANK MARK AND JOHN. AMAZING. AMAZING. I WAS GOING TO SAY, I HAVE A LITTLE SURPRISE. I HAVE A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU  TODAY. OVER THE YEARS, I HAVE DEVELOPED A LOT OF FRIENDSHIPS. SOME PEOPLE ARE GOOD, SOME PEOPLE ARE OK, AND SOME PEOPLE ARE LOUSY, RIGHT? AND SOME PEOPLE ARE GREAT. I WAS SO HONORED BECAUSE I HAVE  A MAN WHO WAS RESPECTED BY  EVERYBODY HERE.  GREATLY RESPECTED. SOME OF THE I HAVE A LOT OF  RESPECT FOR. HE WAS THE EXPERT, AS FAR AS I'M  CONCERNED. WHEN I THINK OF MYSELF NOW AND US, WE WANT STRONG BORDERS. WE WANT THE WALL.   WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, WE  HAVE A CASE WHERE FORMER PRESIDENT FOX OF MEXICO USED A  HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE WORD. IF I WOULD HAVE USED THAT WORD,  IT WOULD'VE BEEN A BIG STORY. THE STORY IS HE IS VERY ANGRY,  BECAUSE HE SAID, ""WE WILL NOT  PAY FOR THAT WALL."" WHEN THESE DISHONEST PEOPLE IN  THE PRESS CALL ME, IT IS SO  TERRIBLE. I SAID, ""WALTER SCOTT 10 FEET HIGHER -- I SAID, ""THE WALL JUST  GOT 10 FEET HIGHER."" YOU SAW HIS ANGER, RIGHT? THAT WASN'T ABOUT THE WALL. THAT WAS, ""HOW DARE YOU TELL US  WHAT TO DO?"" THEY THINK THEY ARE IYROUR BOSSES. IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK THAT WAY. I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU, WE ARE  GOING TO BUILD THE WALL. IS GOING TO WORK, WE ARE GOING  TO HAVE A STRONG BORDER. PEOPLE WILL COME INTO THIS  COUNTRY LEGALLY. ONLY LEGALLY.   WHEN I TALK ABOUT  IMMIGRATION AND WHEN I TALK  ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND  THE PROBLEMS WITH CRIME, I THINK  OF A GREAT MAN. I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO HIM. FOR MY TALKING ABOUT -- WHO AM I  TALKING ABOUT? NOBODY KNOWS, BECAUSE IT IS A RISE -- A SURPRISE. SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS.  BOY OH BOY, IT NEVER  FAILS. THE CAMERAS FOLLOW THAT.  THEY KNOW THAT, LOOK OVER THERE,  THE ALL-TIME RECORD.  CAMERAS, TAKE A LOOK.  UNBELIEVABLE. 32,000 PEOPLE. THIS IS AMAZING. AND BY THE WAY, LOOK OVER THERE?  WE CAN GET THEM IN. WHY CAN'T THEY COME IN? LET THEM IN. LET THEM IN. WE HAVE GOT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE  OVER THERE, LET THEM IN IF YOU  CAN. THAT IS THE FIRST TIME THAT  SENATOR SESSIONS HAS EVER ENDORSED A PERSON RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.   THAT TO ME A BIG DEAL -- THAT IS, TO ME, A BIG DEAL. TIME MAGAZINE, A COUPLE OF WEEKS  AGO, DID A COVER STORY. THIS IS REALLY A MOVEMENT. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE COUNTRY  BACK, RUN IT SMART. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME WHERE WE HAVE MADE SO MANY  DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SO  WRONG, WHETHER IT IS THE IRAN DEAL OR THE BORDERS LIKE SWISS CHEESE. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THE COUNTRY  SO GREAT, DO THINGS SO SMART, WE  ARE GOING TO BE SO CONFIDENT. YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO PROUD OF  YOUR PRESIDENT. YOU WERE NOT PROUD NOW. -- ARE NOT PROUD NOW. YOU'RE GOING TO BE PROUD OF YOUR  PRESIDENT. OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS,  NASTY THINGS WERE SAID. MARCO IS THE LIGHTWEIGHT. THIS GUY, I MEAN, WHEN YOU ARE UP 20 POINTS IN FLORIDA, THE GUY CAN'T BE ELECTED DOGCATCHER IN  FLORIDA, THEIS GUY, LITTLE MARCO, HE'S A NICE GUY, BUT YESTERDAY I GOT THE ENDORSEMENT  OF CHRIS CHRISTIE.  TOUGH GUY, GOOD GUY. WONDERFUL GUY. HE WAS SO ENTHUSIASTIC. WHEN CHRIS WAS RUNNING, I WATCHED A MAN MELT IN FRONT OF  ME. HE STARTED GRILLING LIGHTWEIGHT  MARCO RUBIO. MARCO WAS STANDING NEXT TO ME IN  THE DEBATE, THE ONE BEFORE LAST. HE MENTIONED THE OBAMA PHRASE ONCE. BEEN A SECOND TIME. -- THEN A SECOND TIME.  HE WAS POURING WATER, SWEATING. I THOUGHT HE HAD JUST GOT OUT OF  A SWIMMING POOL WITH THE SUIT ON -- A SUIT ON. I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, I HOPE HE  IS OK.     AY, YAY.   FOLKS, FOLKS, WE HAVE  TO LOVE EVERYBODY. ALL LIVES MATTER. MEMBERREMEMBER THAT. ALL LIVES MATTER.   WE WILL HAVE THESE  LITTLE INTERRUPTIONS. WHEN YOU HAVE 35,000 PEOPLE, IF  YOU HAVE A FEW PROTESTERS, I  GUESS THAT HAS TO HAPPEN, RIGHT? I LOOK AT LITTLE MARCO, AND I  THINK SOMETHING IS HAPPENING  WITH HIM. THAN HE IS MELTING. HE IS SAYING THIS PHRASE A  FOURTH OR FIFTH TIME.  I THINK HE HAS JUST MELTED DOWN. I GET READY, AND I THINK HE IS  GOING TO SIT. --- TO SAY IT. WE DON'T NEED A FAINTER TO NEGOTIATE WITH CHINA AND PUTIN. WE DON'T NEED A FAINTER TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS, DO WE? WE DON'T NEED A GUY WHO IS  SWEATING AND SCARED. SO THAT'S IT, NOW HE ACTS LIKE A  BIG MAN. ""OH, TRUMP IS A CON MAN."" I BUILT AN INCREDIBLE BUSINES  S. I FILED PAPERS THAT WERE UNBELIEVABLE. IF THEY WERE NOT UNBELIEVABLE, THESE GUYS WERE NOT PEOPLE TO  BELIEVE HOW GREAT A COMPANY I  HAVE BUILT. I HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE GUY,  THAT TOOK MONEY TO BUILD A  DRIVEWAY. WHEN THEY CAUGHT HIM, HE SAID, ""I USED THE WRONG CREDIT CARD."" WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HE HAS  DONE, HE TAKES A HOUSE FOR $178,000, OR SO, AND HE SOLD IT  TO A LOBBYIST FOR $380,000, A  LOBBYIST IN THE STATE OF  FLORIDA. THAT ARE SENATOR? -- THAT IS  WHAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AS A  SENATOR?  AS A PRESIDENT? YOU CAN DO IT, THERE IS NO WAY. WE HAVE A PROBLEM.  IS GUYS, ALL OF THEM. I AM SO FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN -- I  AM SELF-FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN. THESE GUYS ARE ALL TAKEN CARE  OF. WHETHER IT IS THE DRUG INDUSTRY  OR THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, THEY TAKE CARE OF THESE PEOPLE.   TELL ME, TELL ME,  ISN'T IT FUN TO THE EDITOR RALLY -- FUN TO BE AT A TRUMP RALLY?   I SAID, ""HE IS NOT  GOING TO MAKE IT."" BERNIE SANDERS WAS SPEAKING AND  THESE TWO WOMEN TOOK OVER THE  MICROPHONE. HE WALKED AWAY, THINKING, OH,  OH. I SAID TO MYSELF, ""WOW."" NO MICROPHONE WILL BE TAKEN OVER FOR ME, I GUARANTEE YOU THAT.   THEY ARE NOT TAKING IT OVER FOR ME, THEY ARE TAKING IT OVER FROM YOU, CAN'T HAPPEN. YOU LOOK SO -- HE LOOKED SO  WEAK. IT'S OVER. HE'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. IN FAIRNESS, HILLARY SHOULD NOT  BE ALLOWED TO RUN. SHE BROKE THE LAW.   SHE IS PROBABLY  PROTECTED BY THE DEMOCRATS. SHE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO RUN, I WILL TELL YOU. YOU EITHER HAVE LAWS OR YOU  DON'T. YOU LOOK AT GENERAL BETRAYPATREAUS, ALL THESE PEOPLE GOT AWAY. 20,000 E-MAILS, 40,000. DOES ANYBODY DO THAT MANY  E-MAILS? LET US SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO RUN  AGAINST HER, WHICH IS GOOD. I THINK IT IS GREAT. THE OTHER GUYS ARE NOT GOING TO  BEAT HER, FOLKS. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO WIN. I GUARANTEE, WE ARE GOING TO BE  TALKING ABOUT THOSE E-MAILS EVERY MOMENT OF EVERY DAY.   WE ARE GOING TO SHAME  THEM INTO DOING THE RIGHT THING. WE ARE GOING TO BEAT HILLARY. IN THE POLLS, I AM LEADING HER. WE ARE ON USA TODAY. I HAVE NOT EVEN STARTED ON HER  YET, I HAVEN'T.   SHE IS NOT RIGHT NOW  PART OF THE EQUATION. IF YOU LOOK, TAKE A LOOK AT THE PEOPLE, GOVERNOR WALKER IS A  NICE GUY, BUT HE ATTACKED TRUMP. JEB BUSH IS A NICE PERSON. LINDSEY GRAHAM, THIS POOR GUY, HE WAS SO VICIOUS. HIS IDEA OF THE WAR, HE THINKS  HE IS A MILITARY EXPERT. HE SAYS, ""I'M A MILITARY EXPERT. WHERE ARE WE? WE ARE NOWHERE. IF WE LISTEN TO SOME OF THESE  GUYS IN THE MILITARY, WE WILL BE  THERE FOR ANOTHER 20 YEARS. WE CANNOT DO IT DID -- WE CANNOT DO IT. WE'VE SPENT $2 TRILLION IN IRAQ AND HAVE DONE NOTHING COU. WE HAVE GOT WOUNDED WARRIORS ALL  OVER THE PLACE. WHAT DO WE HAVE? NOTHING. WE DON'T EVEN CALL THEM. DO YOU KNOW WHO IS TAKING OVER  IRAQ? AND THE SECOND LARGEST OIL SUPPLY? IRAN. THEY FOUGHT FOR YEARS, THEN STOPPED. EVERYBODY COMPLAINS, THEN IT  GOES THE OTHER WAY. THEN WE GET UP, WE BLAST THE HELL OUT OF THEM. WHAT HAPPENS? IRAN TAKES OVER. NOT ONLY DO THEY MAKE THE  GREATEST DEAL I HAVE EVER SEEN  MADE, WITH $150 BILLION, THEY  SHOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN THAT  MONEY. THEY SHOULD HAVE RELEASED THE PRISONERS FOUR YEARS AGO. NOT GET MONEY LIKE IT IS RANSOM. I TOLD THAT STORY ALL THE TIME. I KEPT THINKING THEY WOULD WALK. WE KEPT GIVING UP. THE PEOPLE ARE DANCING IN THE  STREETS. OBAMA IS CALLING THE HEAD THE ""SUPREME LEADER."" I WILL NEVER CALL HIM THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO? THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO, YOU  HAVE THE PRISONERS. DID YOU EVER SEE A DEAL SO LONG? IT IS A HORRIBLE DEAL. YOU WALK IN AND SAY, ""FELLAS,"" BY THE WAY, THE PERSIANS ARE GREAT NEGOTIATORS. YOU WALK IN AND SAY NICELY, AND ACTUALLY ONE OF THE REPORTERS TOLD ME THIS, MY FATHER WAS A GOOD GUY, HE TAUGHT ME TO NEGOTIATE -- BY THE WAY, MARCO RUBIO SAYS MY  FATHER GAVE ME AN HUNDRED $50 MILLION -- $150 MILLION. I STARTED WITH $1 MILLION AND  HAVE BUILT A COMPANY WORTH $10 BILLION. ON AN. -- OH MAN. ""$200 MILLION?"" HE COPIED A FALSE STORY FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST  DISHONEST MEDIA GROUPS I HAVE  EVER SEEN. HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS.  IT IS LOSING ITS SHIRT. SOMEBODY WILL BUY IT AS A VANITY PROJECT. THE NEW YORK TIMES IS SO DISHONEST. THEY DID A STORY THAT WAS INACCURATE. I SAID, I SAID TO THE PRESS, AND  THEY GAVE ME HEAT -- THEY HAVE  TO REPORT ACCURATELY. IF THEY DON'T REPORT ACCURATELY, ALL OF US SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT  TO SUE.  YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH  FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. BUT WHEN THEY DON'T REPORT  ACCURATELY, WE SHOULD HAVE THE  RIGHT TO SUE, TO GET THEM TO REPORT ACCURATELY WITH DAMAGES. RIGHT NOW, THE LIBEL LAWS DON'T  MEAN A THING. THEY WILL BE TOUGHER ON ME NOW. THEY ARE SO DISHONEST, THESE  REPORTERS. THEY ARE, I THINK, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, I AM RUNNING AGAINST  PEOPLE, I HAVE DEALT WITH  POLITICIANS MY WHOLE LIFE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THIS  CROWD, THEY WILL NOT SHOW THE  CROWD. THEY WILL LEAVE HERE, WE WILL  SAY WE HAD 32,000 PEOPLE, MORE  OF THEIR STANDING, AND YOU KNOW  WHAT WILL HAPPEN?  THE STORE TOMORROW WILL SAY, ""DONALD TRUMP MADE A SPEECH IN  FRONT OF AN OK CROWD.""  WHEN THEY WRITE IN ACCURATELY -- INACCURATELY, WE HAVE TO HOLD THEM TO THAT. THEY ARE GOING TO REGRET ALL OF  THE BAD STORIES THEY WRITE.  I AM RUNNING AGAINST DISHONEST  PEOPLE. LITTLE MARCO RUBIO. A TOTAL, TOTAL FEATHERWEIGHT. USE NOT EVEN A LIGHTWEIGHT. -- HE IS NOT EVEN A LIGHTWEIGHT.  YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU BUILD A GREAT BUSINESS, TRUMP TOWER, ALL OF THESE JOBS, THESE COUNTRY CLUBS,  HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF ACRES,  I HAVE SO MANY JOBS AND  BUILDINGS ALL OVER. WHEN OF THE GREAT BUILDINGS OF THE WORLD. 129100 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS. I BUILT A CITY ON THE WEST SIDE  OF THE MANHATTAN RIVER. THEY SAY ""I AM A CON MAN."" YOU DON'T CALL SOME OF THE THAT -- SOMEBODY THAT WHEN YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING. THIS GUY DID SO MANY THINGS. YOU JUST DON'T DO THAT, FOLKS. HE IS NOT COOL. SWEATS TOO MUCH. I DON'T WANT HIM NEGOTIATING FOR  US.   AND THEN WE HAVE LYING TED CRUZ.  THESE PEOPLE I AM DEALING WITH  ARE THE WORST PEOPLE. HE WILL SAY, ""I AM TOTALLY AGAINST OBAMACARE."" THAT THING SHOULD NEVER HAVE  BEEN ALLOWED. BUT OBAMA LIED 28 TIMES. ""YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PLAN."" ALL OF THE STUFF. JUST ENOUGH DEMOCRATS TO GET IT DONE.  WHEN TED CRUZ SAYS DONALD TRUMP  LIKES OBAMACARE, ALL OF THIS,  THESE PEOPLE ARE REALLY BAD. I HAVE DEALT WITH POLITICIANS  ALL MY LIFE, SOME ARE GOOD. MANY ARE DISHONEST. I DON'T THINK THEY ARE AS BAD AS  THE PRESS. WE ARE GOING TO STRAIGHTEN OUT OUR COUNTRIES. WE ARE GOING TO COME UP WITH  SOLUTIONS. YOU CAN ASK THE FOLKS WHO WERE  KILLED AT DISNEY -- THEY ARE BEING REPLACED. THEY HAVE TO CHANGE UP AND TRAIN PEOPLE. THE BIGGEST OPPONENT OF DOING  THAT IS LITTLE MARCO RUBIO. WE ARE IN TROUBLE. WHERE $19 TRILLION IN DEBT GOING UP TO $21 TRILLION. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE A  CLUE, A BUDGET THAT WAS PASSED AS A TOTAL DISASTER. YOU HEARD THE ON THE THIS BUDGET . WERE GOING TO START HAVING  WONDERFUL BUDGETS. WHEN A MAKE THIS COUNTRY SO  STRONG AND BUILD UP OUR MILITARY  WHICH IS SO DEPLETED. OUR MILITARY IS SO DEPLETED FROM MISMANAGEMENT AND LISTENING TO GUYS LIKE LINDSEY GRAHAM TRUCK BOMBS HERE, DROP BOMBS ON A  SIDE. HOW CAN YOU DO THIS IF YOU ARE  DOING THAT. THAT'S WHY WE'RE THERE FOR SO LONG. WE TAKE OUT ISIS. YOU KNOW WE GOT A LOT OF HEAT FOR THAT.  PUTIN WAS VERY NICE AND SAID DONALD DONALD TRUMP IS A GENIUS.","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Rally in Madison, Alabama"

LIVE COVERAGE.  MR. TRUMP: THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.  I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.  I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE OWNER  OF THE PLANT, GAVE AND GLORIA,  YOU ARE HERE SOMEPLACE. I WANT TO THANK RICK SANTORUM, OUR SENATOR, OUR GREAT SENATOR FOR BEING HERE AND FOR THE  ENDORSEMENT. AND FOR ALL OF THE AMAZING WORKERS. GABE SAID THEY ARE THE MOST  IMPORTANT.  THE AMAZING WORKERS. I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH  VERY TOUGH TIMES, BUT WE WILL  MAKE IT BETTER AND WE WILL MAKE  IT BETTER FAST.  JUST WATCH.   TODAY, I WILL TALK  ABOUT HOW TO MAKE AMERICA  WEALTHY AGAIN. WE HAVE TO DO IT. WITH 30-MILES FROM STEEL CITY -- IT'S BURKE PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE  IN BUILDING OUR NATION.  THE LEGACY LIVES IN THE BRIDGES,  AND SKYSCRAPERS THAT MAKE UP OUR A GREAT AMERICAN LANDSCAPE. OUR WORKERS' LOYALTY WAS REPAID,  YOU KNOW IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY,  WITH TOTAL BETRAYAL. OUR POLITICIANS HAVE  AGGRESSIVELY PURSUED A POLICY OF GLOBALIZATION. MOVING OUR JOBS, WEALTH,  FACTORIES TO MEXICO AND OVERSEAS .  GLOBALIZATION HAS MADE THE  FINANCIAL ELITE WHO DONATE TO POLITICIANS VERY, VERY WEALTHY. I USED TO BE ONE OF THEM. I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT I USED TO  BE ONE.  IT HAS LEFT MILLIONS OF WORKERS WITH NOTHING BUT POVERTY AND HEARTACHE. WHEN SUBSIDIZED FOREIGN STEEL IS  DUMPED INTO THE MARKETS,  THREATENING OUR FACTORIES, THE  POLITICIANS HAVE PROVEN THEY DO  NOTHING. FREE YEARS, THEY WATCHED ON THE SIDELINES AS OUR JOBS VANISHED AND OUR COMMUNITIES WERE PLUNGED  INTO DEPRESSION-LEVEL  UNEMPLOYMENT. MANY OF THESE AREAS HAVE NEVER  RECOVERED, AND NEVER WILL UNLESS  I BECOME PRESIDENT.   THEN, THEY WILL RECOVER FAST. OUR POLITICIANS TOOK AWAY FROM  THE PEOPLE THERE MEANS OF MAKING A LIVING AND SUPPORTING THEIR FAMILY. SKILLED CRAFTSMEN AND TRADESPEOPLE, FACTORY WORKERS, HAVE SEEN THE JOBS THEY LOVE SHIPPED THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY. THEN HE PENNSYLVANIA TOWNS, ONCE THRIVING, ARE IN A STATE OF  DISREPAIR. THIS WAVE OF GLOBALIZATION HAS  WIPED OUT TOTALLY, TOTALLY, OUR MIDDLE CLASS.  IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.  WE CAN TURN IT AROUND.  WE CAN TURN IT AROUND FAST.   BUT, IF WE ARE GOING  TO DELIVER REAL CHANGE, WE WILL HAVE TO REJECT THE CAMPAIGN OF FEAR AND INTIMIDATION READING  PROCEED BY POWERFUL  CORPORATIONS, MEDIA LEAKS, AND POLITICAL DYNASTIES.  THE PEOPLE THAT RIGGED THE  SYSTEM FOR THEIR BENEFIT WILL DO AND SAY ANYTHING TO KEEP THINGS  EXACTLY THE WAY THEY ARE. THE PEOPLE WHO RIGGED THE SYSTEM  ARE SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON, BECAUSE THEY KNOW AS LONG AS SHE  IS IN CHARGE, NOTHING IS GOING  TO CHANGE. THE INNERCITIES WILL REMAIN  POOR. THE FACTORIES WILL REMAIN CLOSED.  THE BORDERS WILL REMAIN OPEN.  THE SPECIAL INTERESTS WILL  REMAIN FIRMLY IN CONTROL. HILLARY CLINTON AND HER FRIENDS  IN GLOBAL FINANCE WANT TO SCARE  AMERICANS INTO THINKING SMALL.  THEY WANT TO SCARE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OUT OF VOTING FOR THE BETTER FUTURE. AND YOU HAVE A GREAT FUTURE. THESE PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN HER TENS  OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. MY CAMPAIGN HAS THE ABSOLUTE OPPOSITE MESSAGE. I WANT YOU TO AMASS A MUCH BETTER LIFE FOR YOU CAN BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN DREAM AGAIN.  RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.  I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE HOW MUCH BETTER OUR FUTURE CAN BE IF WE  DECLARE INDEPENDENCE FROM THE ELITES WHO LED US FROM ONE  FINANCIAL AND FOREIGN POLICY  DISASTER TO ANOTHER.  OUR FRIENDS IN BRITAIN RECENTLY  VOTED TO TAKE BACK CONTROL OF  THEIR ECONOMY, POLITICS, AND  BORDERS.   I WAS ON THE RIGHT  SIDE OF THAT ISSUE, AS YOU KNOW. WITH THE PEOPLE.  I WAS THERE.  I SAID IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, I  FELT IT. WHILE HILLARY, AS ALWAYS, STOOD  WITH THE ELITES. BOTH SHE AND PRESIDENT OBAMA  PREDICTED THAT ONE, AND MANY  OTHERS, TOTALLY WRONG. NOW, IT IS TIME FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO TAKE BACK THEIR  FUTURE. TAKE IT BACK.   THAT IS THE CHOICE  THAT WE FACE. WE CAN EITHER GIVE INTO HILLARY  CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN OF FEAR, OR  WE CAN CHOOSE TO BELIEVE AGAIN IN AMERICA. VERY SADLY, WE LOST OUR WAY WHEN WE STOPPED BELIEVING IN OUR COUNTRY. AMERICA HE CAME THE WORLD'S DOMINANT ECONOMY BY BECOMING THE  WORLD'S DOMINANT PRODUCER.  YOU KNOW THAT FROM RIGHT HERE IN THIS PLANT.   THE WEALTH IS CREATED , SHARED BROADLY, CREATING THE  BIGGEST MIDDLE-CLASS THE WORLD  HAS EVER KNOWN. THEN AMERICA CHANGED ITS POLICY FROM PROMOTING DEVELOPMENT IN AMERICA -- IN, IN, IN AMERICA -- TO PROMOTING DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER NATIONS.  THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE ALLOWED FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO  SUBSIDIZE THEIR GOODS. THE VALUE THEIR CURRENCIES. VIOLATE THEIR AGREEMENTS. CHEAT IN EVERY WAY IMAGINABLE. OU POLITICIANS DID NOTHINGR ABOUT IT. TRILLIONS OF OUR DOLLARS AND  MILLIONS OF OUR JOBS FLOWED  OVERSEAS AS A RESULT. I VISITED CITIES AND TOWNS  ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHERE ONE  THIRD OR ONE HALF OF MANUFACTURING JOBS HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT IN THE LAST 20-YEARS. TODAY, WE IMPORT $800 BILLION MORE IN GOODS THAN WE EXPORT. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO DO THAT.  THIS IS NOT SOME NATURAL DISASTER, IT IS A POLITICAL AND POLITICIANS MADE DISASTER.  VERY SIMPLE. IT CAN BE CORRECTED. WE CAN CORRECT IT FAST WHEN WE  HAVE PEOPLE WITH THE RIGHT THINKING. RIGHT UP HERE. IT IS THE CONSEQUENCE --    IT IS THE CONSEQUENCE  OF A LEADERSHIP CLASS THAT  WORSHIPS GLOBALISM OVER AMERICANISM. THIS IS A DIRECT AFFRONT TO OUR  FOUNDING FATHERS, WHO WANTED THIS COUNTRY TO BE STRONG. THEY WANTED TO BE INDEPENDENT,  FREE.   OUR FOUNDING FATHERS  UNDERSTOOD TRADE MUCH BETTER THAN OUR CURRENT POLITICIANS, BELIEVE ME.   GEORGE WASHINGTON SAID THAT THE PROMOTION OF DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING WOULD BE  AMONG THE FIRST CONSEQUENCES TO FLOW FROM AN ENERGETIC GOVERNMENT. ALEXANDER HAMILTON SPOKE  FREQUENTLY OF THE EXPEDIENCY OF  ENCOURAGING MANUFACTURING IN, IN , IN THE UNITED STATES.  LISTEN TO THIS. THE FIRST REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, WARNED ""THE ABANDONMENT OF THE PROTECTIVE POLICY BY THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT WILL PRODUCE WANT AND RUIN AMONG OUR PEOPLE."" HE UNDERSTOOD IT BETTER THAN OUR  CURRENT POLITICIANS, THAT IS WHY  HE WAS ABRAHAM LINCOLN, I GUESS.   OUR ORIGINAL  CONSTITUTION DID NOT EVEN HAVE  AN INCOME TAX.  INSTEAD IT HAD TARIFFS EMPHASIZING TAXATION OF FOREIGN, NOT DOMESTIC, PRODUCTION. TODAY, 240 YEARS AFTER THE REVOLUTION, WE HAVE TURNED  THINGS COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN. WE TAX, REGULATE, AND RESTRICT OUR COMPANIES TO DEATH AND ALLOW  FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT CHEAT TO EXPORT THEIR GOODS TO US, TAX-FREE. HOW STUPID IS THAT? HOW COULD IT HAPPEN?  HOW STUPID IS THAT?   AS A RESULT, WE HAVE  BECOME MORE DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN  COUNTRIES THAN EVER BEFORE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS TIME  TO DECLARE OUR ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE ONCE AGAIN. THAT MEANS --    THAT MEANS VOTING FOR  DONALD TRUMP.   I'LL DO IT.  NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.  NOT EVEN A LITTLE DOUBT.  IT MEANS REVERSING 2 OF THE WORST LEGACIES OF THE CLINTON-YEARS.  AMERICA HAS LOST 1/3 OF ITS MANUFACTURING JOBS SINCE 1997. EVEN AS THE COUNTRY HAS INCREASED THE POPULATION BY 50  MILLION PEOPLE.  AT THE CENTER OF THE CATASTROPHE  ARE 2 TRADE DEALS PUSHED BY BILL  AND HILLARY CLINTON. THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE  AGREEMENT, OR THE DISASTER  CALLED NAFTA. SECOND, CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION.  NAFTA WAS THE WORST TRADE DEAL. CHINA'S ENTRANCE INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION HAS ENABLED  THE GREATEST JOB THEFT IN THE  HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.  IT WAS BILL CLINTON WHO SIGNED  NAFTA.  PEOPLE DON'T REMEMBER. IN 1993. HILLARY CLINTON WHO SUPPORTED IT. THE HAVOC THAT IT WREAKED AFTER  HE LEFT OFFICE WAS UNBELIEVABLE.  IT WAS ALSO BILL CLINTON WHO  LOBBIED FOR CHINA'S DISASTROUS  ENTRY INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, AND HILLARY CLINTON WHO BACKED THAT  TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE AGREEMENT.  AS SECRETARY OF STATE, HILLARY  CLINTON STOOD BY IDLY WHILE CHINA CHEATED ON ITS CURRENCY, ADDED ANOTHER TRILLION DOLLARS  TO THE TRADE DEFICIT, AND STOLE  HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS  IN OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.   I HAVE BEEN TALKING  ABOUT CHINA FOR MANY YEARS.  YOU KNOW WHAT? NO ONE LISTENS.  THEY ARE LISTENING NOW. THAT, I CAN TELL YOU.   THE CITY OF PITTSBURGH AND THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA HAVE LOST 1/3 OF  THEIR MANUFACTURING JOBS SINCE  THE CLINTON'S PUT CHINA INTO THE WTO. 50,000 FACTORIES ACROSS AMERICA HAVE SHUT THEIR DOORS IN THAT  TIME. THIS FACTORY, BECAUSE OF YOUR  GREAT OWNERS, DAVE AND GLORIA,  IS HANGING IN.  THEY JUST TOLD ME, IT IS NOT  EASY. ALMOST HALF OF ALL OF OUR  MANUFACTURING AND TRADE  DEFICITS, AND GOODS WITH THE  WORLD, IS THE RESULT OF TRADE WITH CHINA.  IT WAS ALSO HILLARY CLINTON, THE  SECRETARY OF STATE, WHO SHOWED  US INTO A JOB-KILLING DEAL WITH SOUTH KOREA AS REPORTED BY THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE IN MAY . THIS DEAL -- TRADE DEFICIT WITH  SOUTH KOREA AND DESTROYED NEARLY 100,000 AMERICAN JOBS. AS BERNIE SANDERS SAID, HILLARY CLINTON VOTED FOR EVERY TRADE AGREEMENT THAT HAS COST THE  WORKERS OF THIS COUNTRY MILLIONS  OF JOBS.   TRADE REFORM AND THE  NEGOTIATION OF GREAT TRADE DEALS IS THE QUICKEST WAY TO BRING OUR JOBS BACK TO OUR COUNTRY.   TO UNDERSTAND WHY  TRADE REFORM CREATES JOBS AND IT CREATES A LOT OF THEM, WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW ALL NATIONS  GROW AND PROSPER. MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT SUBTRACTS DIRECTLY FROM OUR GROSS DOMESTIC  PRODUCT. FROM 1947 TO 2001, A SPAN OF OVER FIVE-DECADES, OUR INFLATION ADJUSTED GROSS  DOMESTIC PRODUCT GREW OVER 5%. SINCE 2000 TWO, AFTER WE FULLY  OPENED OUR MARKETS TO CHINESE IMPORT, THE GDP GROWTH RATE HAS  BEEN CUT IN HALF. BUT IS THIS MEAN FOR AMERICA? NOT GOOD.  FOR EVERY 1% OF GDP GROWTH WE  FAILED TO GENERATE IN ANY GIVEN  YEAR, WE FAILED TO CREATE OVER  ONE MILLION JOBS. WHAT A WASTE.  WHAT A SAD, SAD THING.   AMERICAN'S JOB CREATION DEFICIT, DUE TO SLOWER GROWTH SINCE 2002, IS WELL OVER  20 MILLION JOBS. THAT IS JUST ABOUT THE NUMBER OF JOBS OUR COUNTRY NEEDS RIGHT NOW TO PUT AMERICA BACK TO WORK  AT DECENT WAGES. WAGES ARE VERY LOW, BECAUSE  THERE IS NO COMPETITION. THEY WILL GO UP BECAUSE WE'RE  GOING TO THRIVE AS A COUNTRY.   THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP IS THE GREATEST  DANGER YET. THE TPP, AS IT IS KNOWN, WOULD  BE THE DEATH BELOW FOR -- THE DEATH BLOW FOR AMERICAN MANUFACTURING. IT WOULD GIVE THE ECONOMIC LEVERAGE TO IN INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION I WOULD PUT THE  INTEREST OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES ABOVE OUR OWN. -- THAT WOULD PUT THE INTEREST OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES ABOVE OUR  OWN.  IT WOULD PUT CHEATERS, THEY ARE  NOT PLAYING BY THE RULES.  THEY ARE CHEATING. IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR  TRADING COMPETITORS TO SHIP  CHEAP SUBSIDIZED GOODS INTO THE  UNITED STATES MARKET WHILE ALLOWING FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO  CONTINUE PUTTING UP BARRIERS IN  FRONT OF OUR EXPORTS. IT IS VERY HARD TO EXPORT TO THEIR COUNTRIES.  THEY MAKE IT DIFFICULT.  WE ON THE OTHER HAND -- COME ON  IN, EVERYBODY.  COME ON IN. THAT LEADERSHIP. THE TPP WOULD LOWER TARIFFS WILL  LEAVING IN PLACE FOR AND PRACTICES THAT KEEP AMERICAN CARS FROM BEING SOLD OVERSEAS.  THAT ISN'T ALL. CHINA WILL ENTER THE TPP THROUGH  THE BACK DOOR AT A LATER DATE.  THEY ARE WATCHING, STUDYING, AND  THEY ARE NOT IN IT NOW, BUT IF  IT IS, THEY WILL BE IN IT.  IF IT IS NOT, THEY WILL PASS. THE AGREEMENT WILL FORCE  AMERICAN WORKERS TO COMPETE  DIRECTLY AGAINST WORKERS FROM VIETNAM.  ONE OF THE LOWEST WAGE COUNTRIES  ON EARTH. NOT ONLY WILL THE TPP UNDERMINE  OUR ECONOMY, BUT OUR  INDEPENDENCE. THE TPP CREATES A NEW INTERNATIONAL COALITION THAT CREATES DECISIONS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER GIVEN THE  RIGHT TO VETO. THESE COMMISSIONS ARE GREAT FOR HILLARY'S WALL STREET FUNDERS WHO CAN SPEND VAST AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO INFLUENCE THE PEOPLE ON THE COMMISSIONS AND THE OUTCOME.  IT SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE THAT  HILLARY CLINTON, ACCORDING TO BLOOMBERG, TOOK A LEADING PART IN DRAFTING THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP.  PLEASE REMEMBER THAT. ESPECIALLY IN NOVEMBER.   SHE PRAISED OR PUSHED THE TPP ON 45 DIFFERENT OCCASIONS.  EVEN CALLED IT THE GOLD STANDARD .  HILLARY CLINTON WAS TOTALLY FOR  THE TPP JUST A SHORT WHILE AGO. WHEN SHE SAW MY STANCE, WHICH IS  TOTALLY AGAINST, SHE WAS SHAMED  INTO SAYING SHE WOULD BE AGAINST IT TOO. I WILL TELL YOU, IT WAS THE SAME  SHAME SHE HAD RECENTLY WHERE SHE WAS FORCED INTO SAYING ""RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM."" SHE DIDN'T WANT TO SAY IT, BUT  SHE WAS SHAMED INTO THAT ONE.  HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SHE WILL IMMEDIATELY APPROVE IT IF IT IS  PUT BEFORE HER. THAT IS GUARANTEED. GUARANTEED. SHE WILL DO THIS JUST AS SHE HAS  BETRAYED AMERICAN WORKERS. FROM WALL STREET AND THROUGHOUT HER CAREER. HER WHOLE CAREER SHE HAS  BETRAYED THE AMERICAN WORKER.  SHE IS TRYING TO PUT ON A GOOD  FRONT. SHE WILL BETRAY YOU AGAIN.  HER CAREER AND HER HUSBAND HAVE  SIGNED SO MANY DISASTERS. NEVER FORGET NAFTA.  NEVER FORGET IT, BECAUSE YOU  KNOW WHAT IT HAS DONE. I KNOW WHAT IT HAS DONE. IN TOURING, I'VE SEEN THE DEVASTATION IT LEFT BEHIND. SHE WOULD MAKE A SMALL TOKEN CHANGE, DECLARE THE TPP PACT FIXED, RAM IT THROUGH, AND YOU  WOULD SUFFER.  THAT IS WHY HILLARY IS SAYING SHE ONLY HAS PROBLEMS WITH TPP  IN ITS CURRENT FORM. THAT MEANS THEY WILL MAKE A  TWO-WORD CHANGE, THEY WILL FIX  IT, AND SHE WILL FEEL GREAT.  SHE CAN RUSH TO EMBRACE IT AGAIN  AND WILL AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY. IF THE MEDIA DOESN'T BELIEVE ME,  I HAVE A CHALLENGE FOR YOU AND  HILLARY.  ASK HILLARY IF SHE IS WILLING TO  WITHDRAW FROM THE TPP HER FIRST  DAY IN OFFICE AND UNCONDITIONALLY RULE OUT ITS  PASSAGE IN ANY FORM.   THERE'S NO WAY TO FIX TPP. WE NEED BILATERAL TRADE DEALS.  WE DO NOT NEED TO ENTER INTO ANOTHER MASSIVE INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT THAT TIES US UP AND BINDS US DOWN, LIKE TPP DOES.   A TRUMPET  ADMINISTRATION WILL CHANGE OUR TRADE POLICIES, QUICKLY.   THANK YOU. HERE ARE SEVEN STEPS I WOULD PURSUE RIGHT AWAY TO BRING BACK OUR JOBS. NUMBER ONE.  I AM GOING TO WITHDRAW THE  UNITED STATES FROM THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP, WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN RATIFIED. I AM GOING TO APPOINT THE TOUGHEST AND SMARTEST, AND I  KNOW THEM ALL, TRADE NEGOTIATORS  TO FIGHT ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN  WORKERS.   I AM GOING TO DIRECT  THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE TO IDENTIFY EVERY VIOLATION OF TRADE AGREEMENTS A FOREIGN COUNTRY IS CURRENTLY USING TO HARM YOU, THE AMERICAN WORKER.   I WILL THEN INTERACT  ALL APPROPRIATE AGENCIES TO USE EVERY TOOL UNDER AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL LAW TO END THESE ABUSES. ABUSE IS THE RIGHT WORD.   NUMBER FOUR. I WILL TELL OUR NAFTA PARTNERS  THAT I ATTEND TO IMMEDIATELY RENEGOTIATE THE TERMS OF THAT  AGREEMENT TO GET A BETTER DEAL  BY A LOT.  NOT JUST A LITTLE, BY A LOT FOR  OUR WORKERS.   IF THEY DON'T AGREE TO A RENEGOTIATION, WHICH THEY MIGHT NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE SO  USED TO HAVING THEIR OWN WAY -- NOT WITH TRUMP THEY WON'T HAVE  THEIR OWN WAY.   THEN, I WILL SUBMIT  UNDER ARTICLE 2205 UNDER THE NAFTA AGREEMENT THAT AMERICA INTENDS TO WITHDRAW FROM THE  DEAL.   NUMBER FIVE.  I WILL INSTRUCT MY TREASURY SECRETARY TO LABEL CHINA A CURRENCY MANIPULATOR, WHICH  SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE YEARS AGO. ANY COUNTRY THAT DEVALUES THEIR  CURRENCY IN ORDER TO TAKE UNFAIR  ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES, WHICH IS MANY COUNTRIES, WILL BE  MET WITH SHARPLY.  THAT INCLUDES TARIFFS AND TAXES.   NUMBER SIX.  I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT THE U.S.  TRADE REPRESENTATIVE TO BRING TRADE CASES AGAINST CHINA, BOTH  IN THIS COUNTRY AND AT THE WTO.   CHINA'S UNFAIR  SUBSIDY BEHAVIOR IS PROHIBITED  UNDER THE TERMS OF ITS ENTRANCE  TO THE WTO. I INTEND TO ENFORCE THOSE RULES  AND REGULATIONS. THEY SICKLY, I INTEND TO ENFORCE  THE AGREEMENT WITH ALL COUNTRIES -- BASICALLY, I INTEND TO  ENFORCE THE AGREEMENT WITH ALL  COUNTRIES, NOT JUST CHINA. 7, IF CHINA DOES NOT STOP  ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE THEFT OF AMERICAN TRADE SECRETS, I WILL USE EVERY LAWFUL -- THIS IS SO EASY, I LOVE SAYING THIS -- I WOULD USE EVERY LAWFUL PRESIDENTIAL POWER TO REMEDY TRADE DISPUTES, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF TARIFFS  CONSISTENT WITH SECTION 201 AND  301 OF THE TRADE ACT OF 1974, AND SECTION 232 OF THE TRADE EXPANSION ACT OF 1962.  WHEN THEY SAY TRADE EXPANSION,  THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES, NOT US. THERE IS NO EXPANSION. THEY GET THE EXPANSION, WE GET THE JOBLESSNESS. IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE.   PRESIDENT REAGAN  DEPLOYED SIMILAR TRADE MEASURES  WHEN MOTORCYCLE AND SEMI CONDUCTOR IMPORTS THREATENED  U.S. INDUSTRY. I REMEMBER.  HIS TARIFF ON JAPANESE  MOTORCYCLES WAS 45%.  HIS TARIFF TO SHIELD AMERICAN  SEMI CONDUCTOR INDUSTRY WAS 100% .  THAT HAD A BIG IMPACT. A BIG IMPACT.  HILLARY CLINTON AND HER CAMPAIGN  OF FEAR WILL TRY TO SPREAD THE LIE THAT THESE ACTIONS WILL START A TRADE WAR. YOU ALREADY HAVE A TRADE WAR,  AND WE ARE LOSING BADLY.   SHE HAS IT COMPLETELY BACKWARDS. HILLARY CLINTON UNLEASHED A  TRADE WAR AGAINST THE AMERICAN WORKER WHEN SHE SUPPORTED ONE  TERRIBLE DEAL AFTER ANOTHER.  RUM NAFTA, SOUTH KOREA, CHINA -- IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE SHE  WENT, THE AMERICAN WORKER WAS HURT. YOU WILL BE HURT WORSE THAN  BEFORE IF SHE BECOMES PRESIDENT  OF THE UNITED STATES.  THAT, I CAN TELL YOU. A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL END  THE WAR BY GETTING A FAIR DEAL  FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE  AMERICAN WORKER. THE ERA OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER  WILL FINALLY BE OVER. YOU WILL NOT THE IT ANYMORE. I CANNOT GUARANTEE IT, BECAUSE  AFTER ME THEY WILL PROBABLY  START DOING IT AGAIN. BUT WE WILL HAVE 4 AND MAYBE 8  GREAT PRODUCTIVE YEARS.  WILL MAKE SURE WE NEVER GO BACK.   THANK YOU.  THANK YOU, VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYONE. I APPRECIATE IT.  A NEW ERA OF PROSPERITY WILL FINALLY BEGIN. AMERICANS WILL BE INDEPENDENT  ONCE MORE. INDEPENDENT ONCE MORE. DOESN'T THAT SOUND GREAT?   UNDER A TRUMP PRESIDENCY, THE AMERICAN WORKER  WILL FINALLY HAVE A PRESIDENT  WHO WILL PROTECT THEM AND FIGHT  FOR THEM.   WE WILL STAND UP TO  TRADE CHEATING. CHEATING.  CHEATERS, THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE.  CHEATERS. HE WILL STAND UP TO TRADE CHEATS ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE IT  THREATENS THE AMERICAN JOB.   WE WILL MAKE AMERICA THE BEST PLACE IN THE  WORLD TO START A BUSINESS.  WE WILL HIRE WORKERS WHO WILL  OPEN FACTORIES, AND WE WILL GET  RID OF THESE HORRIBLE REGULATIONS THAT MAKE IT  IMPOSSIBLE TO DO BUSINESS IN  THIS COUNTRY.   THIS WILL ALSO  INCLUDE MASSIVE TAX ROOF WARM TO  LIFT THE -- MASSIVE TAX REFORM TO LIFT THE CRUSHING BURDEN ON AMERICAN WORKERS AND BUSINESSES.  WE WILL GET RID OF ALL OF THESE RULES, PROBLEMS, AND BUREAUCRACY  WHICH ARE DESTROYING ABSOLUTELY DESTROY YOU -- ABSOLUTELY DESTROYING OUR JOB CREATION  CAPACITY. WE USED TO BE THE BEST IN THE  WORLD, NOW WE ARE GETTING CLOSE  TO THE BOTTOM.   MANY PEOPLE THINK THESE REGULATIONS ARE AN EVEN GREATER IMPEDIMENT THAN THE FACT THAT WE ARE ONE OF THE HIGHEST TAXED NATIONS IN THE WORLD. WE ARE ALSO GOING TO FULLY CAPTURE OF AMERICA'S TREMENDOUS ENERGY CAPACITY.  THIS WILL CREATE FOR OUR WORKERS , ROADS FOR THE ECONOMY, AND  REDUCE BUDGET DEFICITS, WHICH  ARE MASSIVE. YEARLY BUDGET DEFICITS ARE MASSIVE. ON TRADE DEFICITS, WE DON'T WANT  TO TALK ABOUT IT. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO SHUT DOWN ENERGY PRODUCTION AND THE  MINE. SHE WANTS TO SHUTDOWN, SHE SAID  IT RECENTLY, SHE WANTS TO SHUT  DOWN THE MINERS. I WANT TO DO EXACTLY THE  OPPOSITE.   A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL ENSURE THAT WE START USING AMERICAN STEEL  FOR AMERICAN INFRASTRUCTURE.   AND ALUMINUM.   JUST LIKE THE AMERICAN STEEL FROM PENNSYLVANIA THAT BUILT THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, IT WILL BE AMERICAN  STEEL THAT WILL FORTIFY  AMERICA'S CRUMBLING BRIDGES. AMERICAN STEEL.  IT WILL BE AMERICAN STEEL THAT SENDS OUR SKYSCRAPERS SOARING INTO THE SKY.  A BEAUTIFUL SITE. MORE BEAUTIFUL WITH AMERICAN STEEL. IT WILL BE AMERICAN STEEL THAT REBUILDS OUR CITIES.  IT WILL BE AMERICAN HANDS THAT REMAKE THIS COUNTRY.  IT WILL BE AMERICAN ENERGY MINED FROM AMERICAN RESOURCES THAT POWERS THIS COUNTRY.   IT WILL BE AMERICAN  WORKERS WHO ARE HIRED TO DO THE JOB. NOBODY ELSE.  AMERICAN WORKERS. WE ARE GOING TO PUT AMERICAN  STEEL, AND ALUMINUM, BACK INTO  THE BACKBONE OF OUR COUNTRY.   THIS ALONE WILL CREATE MASSIVE NUMBERS OF JOBS.  HIGH PAYING JOBS. GOOD JOBS. NOT THE JOBS WE HAVE TODAY, WHICH EVERYONE AGREES ARE BAD JOBS.  WE WILL CREATE MASSIVE NUMBERS  OF GOOD JOBS. ON TRADE, IMMIGRATION, FOREIGN POLICY, WE ARE GOING TO PUT  AMERICA FIRST AGAIN.   WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO REJECT HILLARY  CLINTON'S POLICY OF FEAR AND HER POLICY OF ABSOLUTE NONSENSE, BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORKING. IT IS GROSSLY INCOMPETENT, WE CANNOT TAKE IT ANY LONGER, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANY  LONGER. WE ARE GOING TO EMBRACE THE POSSIBILITIES OF CHANGE, BUT REAL CHANGE, NOT OBAMA CHANGE. REAL CHANGE.   IT IS TIME TO BELIEVE  IN THE FUTURE. IT IS TIME TO BELIEVE IN EACH OTHER.  IT IS TIME TO BELIEVE IN AMERICA AGAIN IF -- IN AMERICA AGAIN.  THIS IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO MAKE  AMERICA GREAT AGAIN FOR ALL AMERICANS. FOR ALL AMERICANS.   WE ARE GOING TO MAKE  AMERICA GREAT AGAIN FOR EVERYONE . GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. I PROMISE YOU, IF I BECOME  PRESIDENT, WE WILL BE WORKING AGAIN.  WE WILL HAVE GREAT JOBS AGAIN.  YOU WILL BE PROUD OF YOUR PRESIDENT. YOU WILL BE PROUD, PROUD, PROUD  OF OUR COUNTRY ONCE AGAIN. THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.  I APPRECIATE IT. I APPRECIATE IT.  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.   [NO","Donald Trump Remarks in Monessen, Pennsylvania"

THIS WAS AFTER THEY APPROVED THE EUROPEAN EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, SOMETHING TRUMP   SAID HE SUPPORTED.  THIS IS ABOUT AN HOUR.  >> I APOLOGIZE.   MR. TRUMP: GET HIM OUT.  >> SORRY, MR. TRUMP.  MR. TRUMP: OK.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  I APPRECIATE IT AND THIS IS AN   AMAZING HONOR.  IT'S AN AMAZING DAY, VERY   HISTORIC DAY FOR A LOT OF   REASONS, NOT ONLY TURNBERY.   THIS IS ONE OF THE BIG -- TURNBERRY. THIS IS ONE OF THE BIG VOTES IN   THE HISTORY OF EUROPE, SCOTLAND, EVERYWHERE.   IT WAS VERY EXCITING COMING IN   AND WE WERE LANDING AND WE HAD   JUST HEARD THE RESULTS SO I WISH EVERYBODY A LOT OF LUCK. I THINK THAT IT'S PURELY HISTORIC AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS HISTORIC. SO IT'S AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU.  MY MOTHER WAS BORN IN SCOTLAND IN STORNAWAY. SHE LOVED SCOTLAND. SHE WOULD BE HERE A LOT. SHE WOULD BE HERE WITH MY SISTER, MARIAN AND MY SISTER, ELIZABETH AND SHE JUST LOVED   IT.   HER LOYALTY TO SCOTLAND WAS   INCREDIBLE.   SHE RESPECTED AND LOVED THE   QUEEN AND SHE LOVED THE CEREMONY AND THE POMP, POMP AND   CIRCUMSTANCE, AND SHE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL. AND TO THINK WE'D BE HERE OWNING TURNBERRY ONE DAY WOULD   BE INCREDIBLE. SHE WOULD COME TO TURNBERRY WITH HER FRIENDS AND THEY'D   HAVE DINNER AT TURNBERRY.   SHE DIDN'T PLAY GOLF BUT THEY WOULD HAVE DINNER AT TURNBERRY, SO HAVING TAKEN THIS HOTEL AND   DONE THE JOB THAT WE'VE DONE   WITH IT IS JUST AN HONOR I WAS   GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY. WE BOUGHT IT ABOUT 4 1/2 YEARS   AGO. THE TOWN COUNCIL HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE.   THE LOCAL POLITICIANS AND ALL   OF THE POLITICIANS ALL   THROUGHOUT HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY   INCREDIBLE. THEY APPROVED VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING THAT WE ASKED FOR.   WE ASKED FOR THE RIGHT THINGS, BUT THE APPROVAL PROCESS, BECAUSE IT'S SO HISTORIC, HAD   TO GO THROUGH MANY DIFFERENT LAYERS BUT EVERY SINGLE THING   WE WANTED THEY AGREED. THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD AND IN SOME CASES GREAT.   WE'VE TAKEN THE LIGHT HOUSE,   WHICH IS A VERY, VERY IMPORTANT BUILDING IN FLORIDA -- I MEAN, IN SCOTLAND AND WE'VE TAKEN   THAT BUILDING AND MADE IT SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL. INSIDE THE LIGHTHOUSE RIGHT NOW IS INCREDIBLE SUITES AND IT'S   CALLED THE HALFWAY HOUSE BECAUSE THIS IS THE 9TH TEE AND IT'S CALLED THE HALFWAY HOUSE.  ON THE BOTTOM YOU HAVE DINING   AND GOLFERS WILL STOP AND   THEY'LL GO AND GET SOMETHING TO   EAT AND THEN THEY GO INTO THE 10TH HOLE, 10TH TEE RIGHT NEXT   DOOR. AND IT WAS IN DISREPAIR AND ALL   OF THE PEOPLE FROM LANDMARK   SCOTLAND AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE WE HAD TO GO THROUGH WERE -- I   JUST THANK YOU BECAUSE IT WAS A   LONG, DIFFICULT PROCESS GETTING THAT APPROVED, BUT THEY REALLY WANTED TO SEE IT AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.  AND NOW IT'S REALLY AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN IT EVER WAS.   WHEN YOU SEE -- I DON'T KNOW IF   YOU'LL GET A CHANCE BUT IF YOU   DO YOU SHOULD TRY AND GET TO SEE THE SUITES BECAUSE THEY ARE   TWO OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SUITES YOU'LL EVER SEE.   WHEN THE WATER IS ROUGH TODAY, IT'S VERY CALM. IN FACT, I'VE ALMOST NEVER SEEN IT LIKE THIS BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE WAVES THAT ARE LITERALLY CRASHING ONTO THIS PIECE OF LAND WE'RE ON.  IT'S ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL   SIGHTS YOU'LL EVER SEE. THE HOLE DIDN'T EXIST.  THEY WORKED WITH US ON DESIGN. THEY WANTED TO DO THESE CHANGES FOR PROBABLY CLOSE TO 50 YEARS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO OBVIOUS   AND WE MADE CERTAIN CHANGES TO   THE COURSE IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE FULLY RENOVATED THE COURSE.  BRAND NEW SPRINKLER SYSTEM.   THE HIGHEST LEVEL. MANY OF THE HOLES HAVE BEEN   JIGGERED AND MADE EVEN LONGER   AND NEW GREENS AND NEW   EVERYTHING AND YET IT'S THE   SAME TURNBERRY.   WITH YOU THE WHOLE 9, 10 AND 11 AND 4 HAVE BEEN CHANGED AND MOVED OUT INTO THE OCEAN.   THIS HOLE IS AN EXAMPLE FROM   APPROXIMATELY THIS AREA.  WOULD YOU HIT OVER THERE.   THIS WAS A PAR 4 AND YOU'D HIT   OVER THERE AND IT WAS A MUCH DIFFERENT THING.  NOW YOU'RE HITTING OUT OVER THE OCEAN.  AND JUST BY THE LIGHTHOUSE YOU   HAVE A GREEN AND PEOPLE THINK   THIS WILL BE THE GREATEST PAR 3   ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND THEN 10 BECOMES A PAR 5 THAT THE GOLFERS KNOW AND THE MEMBERS KNOW.   I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF THE   MEMBERS IN TURNBERRY IN THE   BACK, THE CAPTAIN.  WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. AND WE HAVE THEN NUMBER 11,   WHICH IS A SPECTACULAR HOLE.  ALSO A PAR 3.   BUILT RIGHT ON THE CLIFFS.  AND THAT HOLE WAS MOVED ABOUT   200 YARDS TO THE LEFT.  AND TOM WATSON SAW ME AND HE   WON THE BRITISH OPEN MANY TIMES, PETER, RIGHT, AND HE SAID FIVE.  HE SAID WHAT A CHANGE. HE ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS A   VERY EASY HOLE THE WAY IT WAS,   BUT HE PROBABLY LIKED IT BECAUSE HE'D BIRDIE IT ALL THE   TIME. WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WHAT EVERYBODY'S WANTED TO DO FOR MANY, MANY DECADES. I WANT TO THANK MARTIN EBERT WHO HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB AS THE ARCHITECT.   AND I CALLED UP -- I CALLED UP   THE ROYAL AND ANCIENT PETER   DAWSON WHO IS AN AMAZING MAN   AND GREAT GUY AND TALENTED PERSON AND LOVES THE SPORT AND LOVES SCOTLAND AND FRANKLY I   SAID, WHO SHOULD I USE AS THE ARCHITECT AND HE DID ME A BIG FAVOR.  HE RECOMMENDED MARTIN AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU YOU AND I WANT TO THANK PETER DAWSON WHO IS WITH US NOW. HEADED UP THE ROYAL AND ANCIENT   FOR YEARS.  HE'S BEEN JUST A GREAT FRIEND   AND I THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING,   PETER.  YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE.   THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY SON, ERIC, WAS IN CHARGE OF   THE JOB. I WANTED TO COME OVER HERE AND IVANKA AND DAWN CAME TO CONGRATULATE ERIC.  REALLY, WE GAVE HIM THE   RESPONSIBILITY FOR BUILDING THE   HOTEL. AS YOU KNOW WAS GUTTED DOWN TO THE STEEL AND REBUILT.  I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF   THE GREAT HOTELS OF THE WORLD. IT ALREADY WAS BUT IT WAS IN   SOMEWHAT DELAPIDATED SHAPE AND WE HAD A CHOICE.  WE COULD FIX IT AND PAINT IT OR   WE COULD DO IT THE WAY WE DID   IT AND WE WENT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL PLANS.   WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE PLANS   FROM THE ORIGINAL ARCHITECTS FROM MANY, MANY YEARS AGO.  IT WAS 1906 AND WE WENT BACK TO   THOSE PLANS, WHICH ARE MAGNIFICENT ROOMS, VERY BIG. THEY WERE CUT IN HALF AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS HAPPENED OVER   THE YEARS.  AND WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S   VERY SPECIAL.   CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST   BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS IN ALL OF GOLF.   I THINK WE CAN SAY THAT, PETER. USUALLY A BUILDING, WHEN YOU   HAVE A BUILDING ON A GOLF   COURSE THAT'S NOT AN ASSET.   THAT'S CALLED A LIABILITY. THIS IS ONE OF THE BUILDINGS   WHERE EVEN THOUGH IT'S IN THE   DISTANCE, WHEN YOU'RE ON THE   18TH HOLE AND YOU'RE LOOKING   DOWN THE FAIRWAY AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT BUILDING, IT'S   CONSIDERED ONE OF THE GREAT,   BEAUTIFUL AND HISTORIC SITES IN GOLF.   AS YOU KNOW, JACK NICHOLAS WON THE OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP -- JACK   NICKLAS WON THE OPEN   CHAMPIONSHIP AND I GUESS THE   GREATEST, I GUESS ONE OF THE   GREATEST TOURNAMENTS IF NOT THE   SINGLE GREATEST TOURNAMENT IN THE HISTORY OF GOLF WAS THE   DUEL IN THE SUN, 1977 WITH TOM   WATSON AND JACK NICKLAUS WHICH WAS BIRDIE, BIRDIE, BIRDIE.   AND EVERYONE WASN'T IN THE MATCH AND THESE TWO KEPT GOING WILD AND THAT'S WHEN TOM WATSON CHIPPED IN AN AREA THAT YOU   COULDN'T GET FROM THE GREEN LET   ALONE GET IT IN THE HOLE.   THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT IN IS IF YOU CHIPPED IT IN.  JACK IS AN INCREDIBLE SPORTSMAN.  THE WAY HE WALKED OFF THE   COURSE WAS ONE OF THE GREAT   SCENES IN ALL OF GOLF. AND JACK NICKLAUS IS A FRIEND   OF MINE AND GREAT CHAMPION AND   GREAT CHAMPIONS, WHETHER IT'S   TOM WATSON OR GREG NORMAN OR NICK PRICE, WE'VE HAD AMAZING WINNERS AT TURNBERRY.   AND REALLY, NOT ONLY AMAZING WINNERS FOR THE OPEN   CHAMPIONSHIP BUT SOME OF THE BEST TOURNAMENTS THEY EVER HAD. SO WE LISTENED TO THE ROYAL AND ANCIENT AND WE DID WHAT THEY   WANTED US TO DO. IN ADDITION, THEY PUT IN   TREMENDOUS MILES OF TELEVISION   CABLES AND EVERYTHING'S   UNDERGROUND SO IT'S ALL READY   TO GO FROM THAT STANDPOINT. AND THE TOWN IS SO HAPPY AND SO   THRILLED AND THE TOWN COUNCIL, WHO'S HERE, AND I WANT TO THANK   YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE, THEY HAVE BEEN REALLY TERRIFIC.   SO, AGAIN, IN HONOR OF MY   MOTHER, MARY MACCLOUD, WHO IS A   TERRIFIC PERSON. SHE CAME TO THE UNITED STATES   AT THE AGE OF 19. SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL   WOMAN AND A VERY, VERY SMART WOMAN AND SHE MET MY FATHER AND   THAT WAS IT. THEY WERE MARRIED FOR A LONG   TIME AND THEY HAD A GREAT MARRIAGE AND REALLY A GREAT   MARRIAGE BUT IN HONOR OF MY   MOTHER, MARY MACCLOUD, AND IN   HONOR OF MY CHILDREN -- DON WAS   INSTRUMENTAL IN BUYING IT. MY FRIENDS WERE HERE FROM   DUBAI.  GREAT PEOPLE. THIS WASN'T THEIR THING BECAUSE   THEY DIDN'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT   GOLF.   AND THEY ACTUALLY FELT, WHY   SHOULD WE MOVE A HOLE INTO THE OCEAN WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE A   HOLE?   AND I SAID, WELL, IT'S THAT   BETTER.   THEY SAID, YEAH, BUT IT'S ALREADY THERE.  THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE GOLF   THING BUT IT ALWAYS DID WELL.   TURNBERRY, BECAUSE OF ITS   LOCATION, BECAUSE OF THE FACT   YOU ARE ON THE OCEAN, BECAUSE   IT'S ONE OF THE MOST   SPECTACULAR PROPERTIES IN THE   WORLD, THEY ALWAYS DID WELL.  BUT NOW SINCE WE OPENED WE'RE ACTUALLY OPENED A NUMBER OF   WEEKS AGO, THE COURSE, AND WE   HAVEN'T HAD AN EMPTY SLOT. PETER, YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO HEAR THIS.   WE HAVE NOT HAD ONE EMPTY SLOT. IT'S FROM MORNING UNTIL NIGHT   IT'S PACKED SO IT'S A SPECIAL LOCATION.   I DON'T KNOW, IT'S JUST THE LOCATION.   EVERYBODY COMES HERE, WHETHER   IT'S FROM LONDON OR WHEREVER   THEY WANT TO BE, THEY ALL WANT   TO COME TO TURNBERRY. AND WITH THAT I JUST WANT TO THANK A FEW PEOPLE. I HAVE TO THANK RALPH WHO THE   ONE THING THE OTHER OWNERS DID  --   THEY SAID -- WHERE IS RALPH?  RALPH, THE ONE THING THEY SAID,   YOU HAVE A MAN NAMED RALPH.   HE WAS AN ASSISTANT MANAGER AT   THE TIME AND ONE OF THE OWNERS   WHO IS A FRIEND OF MINE SAID HE'S THE MOST TALENTED HOTEL   PERSON AND THEY SAID, YOU   SHOULD HAVE HIM BE MANAGER.   WE APPOINTED HIM MANAGER AND   IT'S GREAT STUFF. THE HOTEL OPENED ABOUT TWO   WEEKS AGO AND IT'S BEEN   AMAZING. . USUALLY WHEN A HOTEL OPENS YOU HAVE DRAINS NOT CONNECTED AND   PIPES AND WATER THAT'S SPEWING   THROUGH THE ROOFS AND ALL SORTS   OF THINGS.  WE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING. THEY DID -- DONE A GREAT JOB.   THE CONTRACTORS HAVE DONE A FANTASTIC JOB. THE HOTEL IS BUILT TO THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF LUXURY. THE COURSE IS BUILT TO THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF TOURNAMENT GOLF.  I THINK THERE'LL BE NOTHING   LIKE IT. IN ONE OF THE REVIEWS, I THINK   IT WAS ""GOLF DIGEST"" IN THE   UNITED STATES, THEY COMPARED THE 14 COURSES AND THE 14 ALL GREAT COURSES.  IT'S WHERE THEY PLAY THE OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP.   AND THIS WRITER SAID, TURNBERRY IS NUMBER ONE.  BUT BECAUSE TRUMP OWNS IT, I'M MAKING IT NUMBER THREE.   I SAID TO MYSELF, THAT'S   HATRED. THAT'S HATRED. BUT I'M USED TO THAT WITH THE   PRESS.  THAT'S OK. I CONSIDERED IT A COMPLIMENT.   I IMMEDIATELY SENT THAT REVIEW. I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY.   I WANT TO ASK PERHAPS ERIC AND IVANKA AND DON TO COME FORWARD   AND SAY A FEW WORDS.  AND AGAIN IVANKA AND ERIC SAID,   WOW, THIS MUST BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IVANKA CAME, RIGHT?   BECAUSE SHE'S SOMETHING ELSE.   MY CHILDREN HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB.  ONE OF THE VERY IMPORTANT   REASONS I'M HERE NOT ONLY   BECAUSE WE OWN IT AND WE'RE   GOING TO CHERISH IT, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF IT, ONE   OF THE GREAT, GREAT PLACES,   GREAT RESORTS OF THE WORLD. BUT ALSO BECAUSE I WANT TO   REALLY SUPPORT MY CHILDREN.   THEY WORKED THEY HARD TO MAKE   THIS PROPERTY WHAT IT IS AND   WHAT IT'S NOW BECOME.   THE REVIEWS OF THE COURSE HAVE BEEN PHENOMENAL. NOT JUST LIKE GOOD. EVEN PEOPLE THAT TRULY HATE ME   ARE SAYING IT'S THE BEST THEY   HAVE EVER SEEN, WHICH IS   ALWAYS, TO ME, PETER, THAT'S MY   GREATEST.   WHEN THEY HATE YOU AND GIVE IT A 10, THAT MEANS YOU DID A GOOD   JOB, RIGHT?   BUT THE REVIEWS HAVE BEEN   PHENOMENAL AND THE REVIEWS OF   THE HOTEL HAVE BEEN GREAT. THE HOTEL IS -- I DIDN'T PUT A   MORTGAGE ON IT.   WE HAVE NO DEBT, NO FINANCING,   NO ANYTHING. I WANTED TO DO THAT WITH TURNBERRY, DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE   ANY FINANCING WITH TURNBERRY BECAUSE IT'S SO SPECIAL.  I DID THIS OUT OF CASH FLOW AND   WE HAVE AN ABSOLUTELY ZERO DEBT PROPERTY.   I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S   GOING TO BE A GREAT TRIBUTE TO SCOTLAND AND MANY OTHER PLACES,   AND ALSO A GREAT TRIBUTE TO THE   WORLD OF GOLF FOR MANY, MANY DECADES TO COME.  SO ALL I ASK ERIC IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE HE BUILT IT.  I'LL ASK ERIC AND IDENTIFY   ADVANTAGEA AND DON TO COME   FORWARD -- IVANKA AND DON TO   COME FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE.   >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.   IT MEANS A WORLD TO US.   IT MEANS A WORLD TO ME, MY FATHER, ANYWHERE THESE DAYS,   BECAUSE OF HIS HECTIC SCHEDULE   WE LOVE YOU TO DEATH AND THANK   YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. WE REALLY SHEPHERDED THIS   PROCESS THROUGH OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS AS HE'S  IF ANYBODY WOULD HAVE   QUESTIONS, GO AHEAD. JOHN?  >> QUESTION ABOUT THE BREXIT,   DO YOU SEE ANY PARALLEL WHAT   HAPPENED IN THE U.K. IN TERMS   OF RISING UP AGAINST THE STATUS QUO AND WHAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING   IN AMERICA? HOW WOULD A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION APPROACH THE   BREXIT SHOULD YOU BE ELECTED   PRESIDENT. SCOTLAND VOTED 62-38 TO REMAIN. SHOULD SCOTLAND LEAVE THE U.K.? MR. TRUMP: I THINK PEOPLE REALLY SEE A BIG PARALLEL.  A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING   ABOUT THAT.   NOT ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES   BUT OTHER COUNTRIES.  PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE THEIR   COUNTRY BACK. THEY WANT TO HAVE INDEPENDENCE IN A SENSE. AND YOU SEE IT WITH EUROPE, ALL OVER EUROPE.  YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE, IN   JUST, MY OPINION, MORE THAN JUST WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MANY OTHER   CASES WHERE THEY WANT TO TAKE   THEIR BORDERS BACK.   THEY WANT TO TAKE THEIR MONETARY BACK.  THEY WANT TO TAKE A LOT OF   THINGS BACK.  THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A   COUNTRY AGAIN.  I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE   THIS HAPPEN MORE AND MORE.  I BELIEVE THAT.   AND I THINK IT'S HAPPENING IN   THE UNITED STATES. IT'S HAPPENING BY THE FACT THAT   I HAVE DONE SO WELL IN THE POLLS.  YOU LOOK AT THE RECENT POLLING AND THE SWING STATES AND YOU SEE HOW I'M DOING. I HAVEN'T STARTED MY CAMPAIGN YET, ESSENTIALLY. WE HAVE DONE VERY WELL. WE'RE RAISING A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I'M GOING TO BE FUNDING A LOT   MYSELF.   BUT WE'RE RAISING A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.   YOU'LL SEE THOSE NUMBERS COME OUT NEVER THE NEXT 30 DAYS. AND IN PARTICULAR 60 DAYS. THE NUMBERS THAT WERE PUT OUT   LAST WEEK WERE -- A VERY SMALL   PERIOD OF TIME JUST TO START.   BUT WE HAVE RAISED A LOT OF   MONEY, ESPECIALLY MONEY COMING   IN IN SMALL -- FROM SMALL DONORS.   YOU'LL BE AMAZED WHEN YOU SEE   THE NUMBERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT   BECAUSE WE WERE AMAZED AND I WAS AMAZED.   THAT WILL BE REPORTED FAIRLY   SOON.   DO I SEE A PARALLEL BETWEEN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES AND -- I DO SEE A PARALLEL BETWEEN WHAT'S   HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES   AND HERE.   PEOPLE WANT TO SEE BORDERS.   THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE POURING INTO THEIR COUNTRY THAT THEY   DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE, WHERE   THEY COME FROM.   THEY HAVE NO IDEA. NOT ONLY DID IT WIN BUT A MUCH   BIGGER MARGIN THAN PEOPLE THOUGHT. >> HOW WOULD YOUR   ADMINISTRATION APPROACH THE   BREXIT? MR. TRUMP: YOU HAVE TO EMBRACE   T IT'S THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. IT'S NOT THE QUESTION OF APPROACHING NOT THE QUESTION OF   APPROACHING IT.   IT'S THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. IT'S ALWAYS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE.   ULTIMATELY THAT WINS OUT.  >> WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE -- SHOULD SCOTLAND LEAVE, SIR?  >> WHAT HAS TAKEN PLACE HERE IN BRITAIN, THE MARKETS --   MR. TRUMP: IF THE BOUND GOES   DOWN THEY DO MORE BUSINESS.   WHEN THE POUND GOES DOWN MORE   PEOPLE ARE COMING TO TURNBERRY,   FRANKLY.  THE POUND HAS GONE DOWN AND SEE   WHAT THE IMPACT IS.   I THINK PLACES LIKE SCOTLAND   AND ENGLAND AND DIFFERENT   PLACES IN GREAT BRITAIN I THINK   YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF ACTIVITY. THE POUND GOT HIGH, AND PEOPLE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY   WANTED TO DO. FOR TRAVELING AND FOR OTHER THINGS, I THINK IT COULD VERY   WELL TURN OUT TO BE A POSITIVE.   NOBODY REALLY KNOWS. YOU'LL KNOW IN ABOUT FIVE YEARS.  YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ANALYZE IT   AND TAKE EVEN LONGER THAN THAT.   WHAT IS KNOWN IS THAT THEY HAVE   TAKEN BACK THEIR INDEPENDENCE.  AND THAT'S A VERY,S VERY   IMPORTANT THING. KATIE? >> MOM YUM RIGHT NOW AND YOU   ARE ON THE WORLD STAGE. ARE YOU TRAVELING WITH ANY OF YOUR FOREIGN POLICY ADVISORS   WHO KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TODAY?   THERE WAS GOING TO BE A DECISION.   ARE YOU HUDDLING WITH THEM TO   FIND OUT WHAT THE BEST WAY --   MR. TRUMP: I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH   WITH THEM BUT THERE'S NOTHING   TO TALK ABOUT.  I HAVE BEEN SAYING I WOULD   PREFER WHAT HAPPENED. I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD   THING.  I THINK IT WILL TURN OUT TO BE   A GOOD THING.   MAYBE SHORT-TERM NOT BUT   ULTIMATELY I THINK IT WILL BE A GOOD THING.   I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN IN TOUCH  -- BY THE WAY, SOME LIKE IT AND SOME DO.  THEY ARE ADVISORS, THEY ARE   LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. THEY PROBABLY KNOW LESS.  EVERY ONE OF THESE ADVISORS.  SOMEBODY SAID YOU SHOULD USE ADVISORS THAT HAVE BEEN HOT FOR   THE LAST FIVE YEARS. I SAID REALLY? I THINK I WANT TO USE ONE THAT   IS HAVEN'T BEEN INVOLVED.   LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED. GO AHEAD.  >> FOLLOW-UP, WE HAD A SPECIAL   RELATIONSHIP, THE U.S. AND   U.K., FOR QUITE SOME TIME.  WITH THIS VOTE THEY ARE   STANDING IN THE WORLD, STANDING IN EUROPE WILL BE DIMINISHED,   THEIR INFLUENCE WILL BE   DIMINISHED. WILL THEY STILL BE THE FIRST   CALL FOR THE U.S.? MR. TRUMP: FIRST CALL OR SECOND?   THERE WILL BE A VERY POWERFUL CALL.   IT WILL BE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.   GREAT ALLIES. ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.   I THINK ZERO WILL CHANGE ON THAT SCORE. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A BETTER ALLY. I THINK NOTHING WILL CHANGE IN   THAT SCORE.  >> MR. TRUMP, DO YOU BELIEVE   THAT THE U.S. SHOULD MOVE   IMMEDIATELY TO RENEGOTIATE   TRADE DEALS WITH THE U.K.? OR LIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS   SAID, SHOULD THE U.K. NOW MOVE   TO THE BACK OF THE LINE IN   LIGHT OF THE VOTE?  MR. TRUMP: PRESIDENT OBAMA DID   SAY, I GUESS, THEY SHOULD MOVE   TO THE BACK OF THE LINE. THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN WITH ME. THE U.K. HAS BEEN SUCH A GREAT   ALLY FOR SO LONG.   THEY'LL ALWAYS BE AT THE FRONT   OF THE LINE.  THEY HAVE BEEN AMAZING ALLIES   IN GOOD TIMES AND BAD TIMES. SOMETIMES THEY MAKE MISTAKES   TOGETHER.   BUT AS WE KNOW THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GREAT ALLIES. I WILL TELL YOU I THINK THAT I   WAS VERY SURPRISED WHEN I HEARD   PRESIDENT OBAMA SAY THAT. AND I THINK HE SAID THAT   BECAUSE HE THOUGHT FOR SURE IT   WAS GOING TO STAY TOGETHER, BUT IT DIDN'T STAY TOGETHER. AND I FELT IT WOULDN'T STAY TOGETHER.   AGAIN I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S   HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES.   IT'S NOT STAYING TOGETHER, IT'S   A REALLY POSITIVE FORCE TAKING PLACE.  THEY WANT TO TAKE THEIR COUNTRY BACK.   THE PEOPLE WANT THEIR COUNTRY   BACK. WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE OUR JOBS. WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE OUR BORDERS.  THEY WANT TO HAVE WAGE INCREASES. FOR THE MEMENT AND ALL MY MEMBERS OF TURNBERRY, WE HAVE HAD HARDWORKING GREAT PEOPLE   THAT HAVEN'T HAD A REAL WAGE INCREASE IN 18 YEARS. SO THEY ARE WORKING HARDER NOW AND MAKING LESS MONEY. GO AHEAD.  >> FOLLOW-UP ON THAT. THE TREASURY SECRETARY, THE FED   CHAIRWOMAN HAVE BOTH SAID THEY   EXPECT THIS, IF IT WAS   SUCCESSFUL, WOULD HAVE A   NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE U.S. ECONOMY.  ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THAT?   MR. TRUMP: THEY DON'T IN A   MOMENT WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT.  WHAT I LIKE IS THAT I LOVE TO   SEE PEOPLE TAKE THEIR COUNTRY   BACK. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES.   I THINK YOU SEE THAT.   THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MANY   OTHER PLACES OF THE WORLD.  THEY ARE TIRED OF IT. THEY WANT TO TAKE THEIR COUNTRIES BACK.   THIS ISN'T SUCH A PHENOMENAL --   SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING, WHEN PEOPLE ASKED ME WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN, I SAID I THOUGHT   IT WOULD BREAK AWAY.  IT WAS SURPRISING BECAUSE THE   POLLS INDICATED PROBABLY THAT   IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN, 80%. WHEN I LANDED THIS MORNING, THE FIRST THING I ASKED IS THAT. IT WAS FAIRLY CLOSE, BUT IT   WASN'T THAT CLOSE.  WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.   I THINK IT WILL BE A GOOD THING.  YOU'RE TAKING YOUR COUNTRY   BACK. YOU'RE GOING TO LET PEOPLE YOU   WANT INTO YOUR COUNTRY. AND PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T WANT, OR PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T THINK ARE GOING TO BE APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR COUNTRY, OR GOOD FOR YOUR   COUNTRY, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO   HAVE TO TAKE. LOOK, EUROPE LIKE THE UNITED STATES, HAS MADE TREMENDOUS MISTAKES OVER THE LAST PERIOD   OF TIME. YOU LOOK AT GERMANY, SOME OF   THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING.  THERE HAVE BEEN TREMENDOUS   MISTAKES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE.   I THINK IT'S GOING TONED UP   BEING A VERY GOOD THING BUT IT   WILL TAKE TIME.  >> YOUR CAMPAIGN HAS GOTTEN   GLOBAL ATTENTION, ALL OVER THE   WORLD PEOPLE KNOW WHO DONALD   TRUMP IS AND YOUR CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT, DO YOU THINK ANYTHING YOU SAID IN THE UNITED STATES INFLUENCED VOTERS HERE   IN BRITAIN WHEN IT COMES TO   LEAVING THE E.U.?   MR. TRUMP: GOOD QUESTION.   IF I SAID YES, TOTAL INFLUENCE. THEY'LL ALL SAY THAT'S   TERRIBLE, HIS EGO IS TERRIBLE.  WILL I NEVER SAY THAT.  I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU THAT ONE,   BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT. LOOK, THE QUESTION WAS, WHAT DO   I THINK? I GAVE MY OPINION A FEW TIMES   OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS, BUT I   ALSO SAID I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE IT'S   NOT ME. IT'S ABOUT THEM. IT'S ABOUT THEM. IT'S THEIR COUNTRY.   BUT MY OPINION IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED.  AND I THINK THEY'LL END UP BEING STRONGER FOR IT AND   CONTROL THEIR COUNTRY AND   CONTROL EVERYTHING ABOUT THEIR   COUNTRY. YES. >> AMANDA, SKY NEWS.  DAVID CAMERON SAID YOU WERE   WRONG WHEN YOU PROPOSED BANNING   MUSLIMS FROM ENTERING THE U.S.  DO YOU THINK HE GOT THE MOOD OF   HIS COUNTRY WRONG AND RIGHT TO RESIGN?   MR. TRUMP: I LIKE DAVID   CAMERON.  HE HAD A COUPLE OF ROUGH   STATEMENTS, BUT THAT'S OK. I THINK DAVID CAMERON'S A GOOD MAN.  HE WAS WRONG ON THIS.   HE DIDN'T GET THE MOOD OF HIS COUNTRY RIGHT.  HE WAS SURPRISED.   I THINK HE WAS VERY SURPRISED   TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED. HE'S A GOOD MAN.  AND HE FELT THAT WAY.   AND PROBABLY DID THE RIGHT   THING. BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I LIKE DAVID CAMERON. YES, SIR.  >> DO YOU THINK FOLLOWING YOUR   ARGUMENTS ABOUT SOVEREIGNTY, DO   YOU THINK SCOTLAND SHOULD HAVE   ITS INDEPENDENCE? WOULD YOU SUPPORT THAT?   MR. TRUMP: THAT'S UP TO THE   PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND. WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS.  AND REALLY, AGAIN, I LEAVE IT   UP TO THE PEOPLE.   I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND. THAT'S WHY I BUILT -- I BUILT IN ABERDEEN ONE OF THE GREAT GOLF COURSES OF THE WORLD.  IT WAS JUST JUDGED TO BE THE GREATEST COURSE EVER BUILT.   NEW BEING DEFINED FROM 1960 TO   PRESENT. WE'RE VERY PROUD OF IT. AND I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW THE   PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND SO WELL.   THROUGH MY MOTHER AND THROUGH   EVERYTHING ELSE.  THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND ARE   AMAZING PEOPLE. AND THAT QUESTION REALLY HAS TO   BE ADDRESSED TO THE PEOPLE. IT WAS A VERY, VERY CLOSE VOTE. I DON'T KNOW THAT PEOPLE WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN. I WAS HERE WHEN THEY WERE GOING THROUGH THAT VOTE.  I DIDN'T TAKE SIDES.  I WILL TELL YOU IT WAS A NASTY   PERIOD.   I CAN'T IMAGINE TO GO THROUGH   THAT AGAIN.   THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND MAY SPEAK DIFFERENTLY. YES? >> FROM WHAT YOU SAID AS WELL   ABOUT EUROPE AND OTHER   COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, WOULD YOU   SUPPORT THE BREAKUP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION?   BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT   WOULD HAPPEN. MR. TRUMP: IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S   ON ITS WAY.   WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.   I CAN TELL YOU I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS LIVING IN GERMANY THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY PROUD GERMANS.  TO A LEVEL THAT YOU WOULDN'T   BELIEVE.  THEY WOULD BE BRAGGING ABOUT   THEIR COUNTRY. THEY WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THEIR COUNTRY AS THOUGH THERE   WAS NO OTHER PLACE.   THEY ARE MEMBERS OF DIFFERENT   PLACES THAT I HAVE.   AND NOW THOSE SAME PEOPLE, SOME   OF THEM, ARE SAYING THEY ARE   LEAVING GERMANY.  THEY ARE MOVING.  THEY NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF   MOVING.   NOW THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT   MOVING BECAUSE OF THE TREMENDOUS INFLUX OF PEOPLE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN   GERMANY. IT'S A REAL PROBLEM. AND THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE VERY PROUD GERMANS THAT WERE BEYOND BELIEF.  THEY THOUGHT THE GREATEST THAT   THERE EVER WAS.   AND NOW THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT   LEAVING GERMANY. AND YOU SEE THE PROBLEMS IN   GERMANY.  SO I COULD SEE IT HAPPENING.  I HAVE NO OPINION, REALLY, BUT I COULD CERTAINLY SEE IT   HAPPENING.  I SAW THIS HAPPENING.   I COULD READ WHAT WAS HAPPENING HERE. I COULD SEE THINGS HAPPENING IN GERMANY.  I HOPE THEY STRAIGHTEN OUT THE SITUATION BECAUSE IT CAN REALLY   BECOME A NASTY -- IT CAN BE   VERY NASTY WHAT'S GOING ON CAN BE VERY, VERY NASTY.  BUILDING SAFE ZONES IN SYRIA.   GREAT IDEA.   BUILDING SAFE ZONES, MAGNIFICENT, BIG, SAFE AS CAN BE.   BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THEM INTO THE   UNITED STATES BY THE THOUSANDS,   AND WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE,   WHEN YOU ARE TAKING THEM INTO GERMANY AND OTHER COUNTRIES,   AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK   AROUND. LOOK AROUND THE WORLD, SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.   SOME REAL PROBLEMS.  >> IT IS EASY FOR POLITICIANS TO USE IMMIGRATION TO DIVIDE   ELECTORATES. HOW DOES A LEADER UNITE PEOPLE? MR. TRUMP: YOU UNITE PEOPLE BY   HAVING A HAPPY COUNTRY.   WHEN PEOPLE POUR INTO THE   COUNTRY AND IT DOESN'T WORK   WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE OF CRIME OR VARIOUS OTHER THINGS.  YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE UNITING ANYBODY.  I JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT GERMANY   WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO LEAVE   GERMANY.  PEOPLE -- I WOULD NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS HAVE SAID THESE PEOPLE WANT TO LEAVE.   BUT THEY ARE GOING TO BE LEAVING.  YOU CAN'T UNITE A COUNTRY BY   FORCING THINGS DOWN THE   PEOPLE'S THROATS.   THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE.  PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY.   YES, SIR.  >> A SEISMIC IMPACT ON THE BRITISH ECONOMY, DO YOU INTEND   TO SCALE BACK YOUR INVESTMENTS   IN SCOTLAND?  HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE ON THE   SITE LINES OF THE NEWSPAPER?  MR. TRUMP: I HAVE BIG INVESTMENTS OVER IN EUROPE. I OWN DUNEBAG IN IRE LAN, A PHENOMENAL HOTEL. ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL, ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY DETERIORATE   RATHED IN ALL OF EUROPE.  IT HAS A GOLF COURSE ON THIS   LARGE ALMOST 500 ACRE PARCEL OF   LAND ON THE ATLANTIC OCEAN.   AND DOES GREAT.   I OWN TURNBERRY, I OWN ABERDEEN.   I'M GOING TO STOP AT ABERDEEN FOR A LITTLE WHILE. I'M LEAVING-DIRBLE' ONLY BE   HERE ONE NIGHT BECAUSE I HAVE   TO GO BACK AND CAMPAIGN, WHICH   I LOVE DOING, TO BE HONEST.   REALLY I WANTED TO SUPPORT MY CHILDREN WHO HAVE REALLY POURED   THEIR HEARTS AND SOULS INTO THIS DEVELOPMENT. I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND.   GO AHEAD.  >> CAMPAIGNING, A LOT OF PEOPLE   IN THE STATES ARE SAYING, DID YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE HERE FOR   THIS? MR. TRUMP: BECAUSE I SUPPORT MY   CHILDREN. NEXT.  >> YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU PAID FOR TURNBERRY WITHOUT ANY DEBT. NOW YOU'RE A POLITICIAN. DOES IT BUG YOU TO HAVE TO PICK   UP THE PHONE AND ASK PEOPLE TO   DONATE TO YOUR CAMPAIGN?  MR. TRUMP: I DON'T LIKE DOING IT. AGAIN, I'M AN HONEST POLITICIAN, PROBABLY ONE OF THE FEW. TOM'S ASKING DOES IT BOTHER ME   WHEN YOU'RE RAISING MONEY, AGAIN, TOM, I'M RAISING THIS MONEY FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. IT'S SOMETHING I HAVE NEVER DONE.   I ALWAYS CONTRIBUTED MONEY TO   LOTS OF PEOPLE.   A LOT OF CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS   OVER THE YEARS. ONCE I RAN I BECAME AN OUTSIDER.   HE DON'T LIKE DOING THAT BUT I   HAVE DONE IT.  --I DON'T LIKE DOING THAT BUT I   HAVE DONE IT.   LAST WEEK I WAS IN HOUSTON.   WE HAD TREMENDOUS LINES.  THE LINES WERE ON ABC THEY REPORTED, ABC LOCAL THEY   FOLLOWED THE LINES ALL THE WAY   TO THE HIGHWAYS.  I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE   THAT.   THEN DALLAS WHERE WE HAD A   SIMILAR THING. BUT WE ALSO HAD FUNDRAISERS.  I SIT WITH 20 PEOPLE AND WE TALK.   THEY ALL YOU CHECKS. BINGE, BINGE, BINGE. CHECKS TO THE R.N.C. AND REPUBLICAN PARTY.   I FEEL I HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO DO THAT.  TOM, THE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO   BE, I THINK, QUITE STAGGERING. ESPECIALLY IN JULY.   STEVE IS HERE SOMEPLACE. STEVE, ARE WE DOING WELL,   STEVE? HE'S ONE OF THE GREAT   FINANCEERS OF THE COUNTRY, ACTUALLY.   I CHOSE HIM AND HE WANTED TO DO   THIS. THE NUMBERS ARE STAGGERING. DON'T FORGET, WE JUST SORT OF   STARTED THIS PROCESS A FEW   WEEKS AGO.  THE FIRST FILING WAS FOR A VERY   LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME. BUT THE NUMBERS ARE AMAZING.  ACTUALLY, THE NUMBERS FOR THE   SMALL DONATIONS, WE HAVE TAKEN   A LOT OF MONEY OTHERWISE, BUT   THE NUMBERS FOR THE SMALL   DONATIONS ARE COMING IN AT -- I   MEAN IT'S BEYOND ANYTHING THAT   WE THOUGHT. THE $25 AND $50 AND $100 DONATIONS.  BUT WE'LL BE REPORTING IN JUNE, BUT ESPECIALLY THE JULY REPORT, I THINK, WE'LL SHOW YOU SOME PRETTY MASSIVE NUMBERS. I JUST DID THE OTHER DAY.   I MATCHED.  I PUT UP $2 MILLION AND SAY LET'S SEE WHO IS GOING TO GO. WE HAVE RAISED MORE THAN TWO. I GUESS I OFFERED A $2 MILLION   INCENTIVE TO PEOPLE TO PUT UP MONEY.  I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS THE REASON, BUT WE HAD A TREMENDOUS   RESPONSE TO THAT. DAVID? >> BACK TO THE BREXIT THING,   YOU SAID DAVID CAMERON MAYBE   MISREAD THE MOOD OF HIS COUNTRY.  GIVEN THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME   OVER HERE AND TRIED TONE   COURAGE PEOPLE TO VOTE TO   REMAIN, AND HILLARY CLINTON   MADE IT CLEAR, WHAT DO YOU   THINK IT SAYS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON HAS MISREAD THE WORLD   AND SINCE SHE'S A FORMER   SECRETARY OF STATE -- MR. TRUMP: SHE'S ALWAYS MISREAD   EVERYTHING. SHE MISREAD THIS.   I WAS SURPRISED SHE WAS SO BOLD  -- THE ONLY REASON SHE DID IT   BECAUSE OBAMA WANTED IT.  IF OBAMA WANTED IT THE OTHER   WAY, SAID LEAVE, SHE WOULD HAVE SAID LEAVE.   SHE DOES WHATEVER HE WANTS HER   TO DO.  YOU KNOW WHY?   THAT'S OK.  WE DON'T HAVE TO GET INTO THAT.   I WAS ACTUALLY VERY SURPRISED THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WOULD HAVE COME OVER HERE.   HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO BOLD TO   TELL THE PEOPLE OVER HERE WHAT TO DO. I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HIM. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE VOTED -- I THINK IF HE HAD NOT SAID IT, I THINK YOUR RESULT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT.   BUT WHEN HE SAID IT, PEOPLE   WERE NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT AND I   THOUGHT IT WAS TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE.  WHEN I SAID WHAT I SAID, I TOLD PEOPLE DON'T DO WHAT I'M SAYING.   DO WHATEVER YOU THINK.  BUT THIS WAS JUST MY OPINION.   HE CAME IN AND REALLY TRIED TO   CONVINCE PEOPLE TO STAY.  I SAID IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE AND SHE DOUBLED DOWN AND DID THE SAME THING.   OBVIOUSLY FOR THE 219TH TIME THEY WERE WRONG.  THEY ARE ALWAYS WRONG.  THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THEM.   YES. >> DAVID CAMERON RESIGNING   TODAY, WOULD YOU BACK JOHNSON   AS -- MR. TRUMP: I DON'T KNOW.  I'M SURE HE'LL BE GOOD. HE GOT IT RIGHT.  SO THAT GIVES HIM AN ADVANTAGE. BUT I DON'T KNOW.  >> SINCE YOUR CAMPAIGN SHAKEUP   I GUESS IT WAS EARLIER IN THE   WEEK, CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT DAY   IT IS NOW, WE HAVE SEEN A   CAMPAIGN THAT HAS BECOME MORE FOCUSED, MORE DISCIPLINED, MORE AGGRESSIVE, AND RAPID RESPONSE. YOU MORE ON POINT I THINK THAN   WE HAVE SEEN YOU IN THE PAST. IS THIS THE NEW YOU? MR. TRUMP: I DON'T THINK SOW. FIRST OF ALL COREY WAS FANTASTIC AND WE DID A GREAT JOB WITH A VERY SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE.   I SAY THIS TO ALL THE FOLKS   HERE THAT DON'T COME FROM THE   UNITED STATES, I RAN A CAMPAIGN IN THE PRIMARIES WHERE WE GOT   THE LARGEST NUMBER OF VOTES IN   THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, PRIMARY VOTES.   LARGER THAN RONALD REAGAN,   RICHARD NIXON, LARGER THAN DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER WHO HELPED   WIN THE SECOND WORLD WAR.   WE RAN A VERY LEAN CAMPAIGN. I HAD FEWER PEOPLE AND SPENT   LESS MONEY AND I FUNDED THE   MONEY MY SEFMENT I SPENT $55 MILLION I THINK.  SOMETHING. WHATEVER IT IS.   BY THE WAY, I'M FORCED --   LEGALLY I HAVE TO PAY MYSELF BACK.   IN OTHER WORDS, THIS HAS   NOTHING TO DO WITH CAMPAIGN. YOU WON'T SEE THIS.   THIS IS TO SUPPORT MY CHILDREN.   BUT IF I USE ONE OF MY RESORTS   IN THE UNITED STATES AND WE   HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE OR   SOMETHING, BY LAW I HAVE TO PAY MYSELF BACK.  I WOULD LIKE NOT TO.  I WOULD LIKE TO SAY USE THE   BALLROOM AND NOT BOTHER WITH   IT.   A COUPLE OF PEOPLE SAID -- BY   LAW YOU HAVE TO PAY YOURSELF BACK.   I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN CREDIT FOR, IN   ADDITION TO WINNING, FOR WINNING WITH LESS MONEY SPENT   AND WITH A SMALLER STAFF.   SO NOW WE HAVE A STAFF OF 73 PEOPLE.   AND HILLARY HAS A STAFF OF 900 PEOPLE.   I WON AND SHE WON. I DON'T THINK THAT -- HONESTLY AS A BUSINESSMAN I SAY, WOW, HE   WON WITH SPENDING LESS MONEY   AND SMALLER STAFF.  I VIEW THAT AS AN ADVANTAGE.  A LOT OF PUNDITS SAY SHE HAS A MUCH BIGGER STAFF.  I THINK WE'RE VERY NIMBLE. I THINK WE'RE DOING WELL.   YOU HAVE SEEN THE POLLS COMING OUT.  THEY ARE VERY CLOSE AND EQUAL.  WE JUST HAD ONE COMING OUT FROM   WEST VIRGINIA WHERE I HAVE A 25-POINT LEAD.  NORTH CAROLINA CAME OUT YESTERDAY WE HAVE A TWO-POINT LEAD. OHIO'S EVEN.  PENNSYLVANIA'S EVEN.  THE NATIONAL POLLS ARE GETTING   VERY CLOSE.   AND I'M SPENDING MUCH LESS MONEY.  SHE'S SPENDING TREMENDOUS   AMOUNTS OF MONEY. WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED YET. IT'S GOING TO BE VERY   INTERESTING BECAUSE SHE SPENT,   WHAT WAS IT, $28 MILLION?   SHE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY AND   WE'RE EVEN. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.   I THINK THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.   WHEN I WON NEW HAMPSHIRE I SPENT A TINY FRACTION OF WHAT OTHER CANDIDATES SPENT. ONE IN PARTICULAR.  I WON NEW HAMPSHIRE BY   LANDSLIDE. THAT PERSON CAME IN SEVENTH.  I THINK WHEN YOU CAN DO IT ON A   SMALLER BUDGET AND WITH FEWER   PEOPLE, THAT'S THE KIND OF   PERSON THEY WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT. BECAUSE TO ME THAT'S A BIG THING. >> MR. TRUMP, SEVEN IN 10   VOTERS TOLD US IN A CNN POLL THEY WANT TO SEE YOU CUT TIES WITH YOUR BUSINESS.   MR. TRUMP: I WILL DO THAT. >> WHILE YOU'RE RUNNING?  MR. TRUMP: I DON'T THINK   WHETHER IT MATTERS WHILE I'M RUNNING.  I'M HERE FOR THE SOUL REASON,DY WANT TO SEE THE JOB ERIC DID BECAUSE IF HE DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB HE WOULDN'T BE STANDING   HERE RIGHT NOW.   I WOULD GIVE HIM A HARD TIME.   HE DID A BEYOND JOB. THIS IS PHENOMENAL.   JUST AS YOU VIEW THIS GREAT   COURSE, YOU HAVE TO SEE THE   HOTEL THAT WE BUILT.  IT'S PHENOMENAL.  I WILL ABSOLUTELY CUT TIES. THE RULES ARE, NOBODY KNOWS.  IT'S NEVER HAPPENED WHERE SOMEBODY HAS HAD THIS BIG A   BUSINESS AND RUNS FOR PRESIDENT AND WINS.   IF I WIN -- EVEN THOUGH I DON'T   HAVE TO DO THAT, I WOULD   PROBABLY PUT EVERYTHING IN   TRUST. MY CHILDREN WILL RUN IT ALONG WITH MY EXECUTIVES.   IT'S A BIG COMPANY.   MY CHILDREN WILL RUN IT ALONG   WITH MY COMMECKTIFFS. AND JUST DO A GOOD JOB RUNNING T LET ME TELL YOU, THE IMPORTANCE OF -- RUNNING IT. LET ME TELL YOU THE IMPORTANCE OF THE OPPORTUNITY I MAY BE   GIVEN IS SO IMPORTANT AND SO MASSIVE, MAKING GREAT TRADE DEALS WITH CHINA. AND WITH YOU FOLKS, BY THE WAY, BUT WITH CHINA. THE NUMBERS ARE SO STAGGERING,   WHEN YOU LOOK AT TRADE DEFICITS  $400 BILLION AND $500 BILLION,   THE NUMBERS ARE SO STAGGERING   AND SO INCREDIBLE.  I WOULDN'T EVEN BE THINKING   ABOUT THE BUSINESS. WHO CARES.  I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY WHO CARES?   I WOULD ABSOLUTELY -- YOU DON'T   WITH A TO DO THIS BUT I WOULD   MOST LIKELY PUT IT IN A BLIND   TRUST AND THEY WOULD RUN IT OR SOMETHING. >> I THINK THIS IS THE NINTH   TRUMP PROPERTY WE VISITED DURING YOUR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.   WHY DO YOU CONTINUE -- MR. TRUMP: NUMBER ONE I HAVE   THE BEST PROPERTIES. YOU CAN SAY THAT.   I WILL SAY A LOT OF THE PRESS   HAS SAID, WHETHER YOU LIKE HIM   OR NOT, THERE'S NO PROPERTIES   LIKE THAT.  I HAVE THE BEST PROPERTIES. YOU DON'T GET TO SEE THAT.  BUT I HAVE THE BEST PROPERTIES.   THE OTHER THING IS I WHY SHOW   YOU SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROPERTIES? NUMBER ONE THEY ARE NOT AS   GOOD. NUMBER TWO IT'S ONE OF THOSE THIFPBLGTS I WISH FRANKLY I WASN'T FORCED BY LAW TO BAY MYSELF BACK. WE'RE FORCED TO PAY.  A COUPLE PEOPLE SAY HE'S PAYING TO HIS CAMPAIGN. I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE EVERYTHING   FOR NOTHING. BUT BY LAW I'M FORCED WHATEVER THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE   BALLROOM IS OR WHATEVER IT MAY   BE THAT WE USE OR AN AIRPLANE AS AN EXAMPLE.  I USE AN AIRPLANE, BY LAW I   HAVE TO PAY IT BACK. THAT'S WHAT I DO. THAT'S REFLECTED IN THE   FILINGS. >> MR. TRUMP, THERE'S BEEN A LONG-STANDING TRADITION IN   AMERICAN POLITICS THAT POLITICS   STOPS AT THE WATER'S EDGEMENT GIVEN YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA THIS MORNING IT   SEEMS THAT YOU DON'T SEEM TO   BUY INTO THAT.  MR. TRUMP: HE DIDN'T STOP IT AT   THE WATER'S EDGE BECAUSE HE MADE STATEMENTS ABOUT THIS INCREDIBLE PART OF THE WORLD AND THAT THIS PARTICULAR   COUNTRY AND FRANKLY A LARGE GROUP OF COUNTRIES SHOULD DO. HE'S CONSTANTLY DICTATING TO   THE WORLD WHAT THEY SHOULD DO.  THE WORLD DOESN'T LISTEN TO   HIM, OBVIOUSLY.   YOU CAN SEE THAT BY THE VOTE. BUT HE'S CONSTANTLY DICTATING   TO OTHER COUNTRIES.   CERTAINLY IT DOESN'T STOP AT   THE WATER'S EDGE WITH HIM. VERY IMPORTANTLY GOT IT TOTALLY   WRONG. HE'S EMBARRASSED. HE'S EMBARRASSED BY THE SUPREME   COURT DECISION YESTERDAY WHICH   WAS A REAL REDUKE. AND HE'S VERY EMBARRASSED BY HE   GOT -- REBUKE. HE'S VERY EMBARRASSED BY HE GOT   INVOLVED. I DON'T KNOW IF HE DID THAT BECAUSE OF A FRIENDSHIP WITH   DAVID CAMERON. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING HE   SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE. IT'S NOT HIS COUNTRY. IT'S NOT HIS PART OF THE WORLD. HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE T I THINK HIS RECOMMENDATION PERHAPS CAUSED IT TO FAIL. ONE MORE QUESTION. >> HOW MUCH OF THE BREXIT VOTES   HAS BEEN ECONOMIC ISSUES THAT   YOU HAVE BEEN HAMMERING HOME ON   THE CAMPAIGN, LOW WAGES, LACK OF GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY? MR. TRUMP: A LOT OF IT IS.  I THINK A LOT IS BORDERS,   IMMIGRATION. I THINK I HAVE SPOKEN.  I HAVE SO MANY MEMBERS HERE,   HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF   MEMBERS SITTING IN THE BACK.  I HAVE SPOKEN TO THEM.  THEY ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE   PEOPLE FLOWING INTO THE COUNTRY. THEY DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. AND I THINK THAT HAS A LOT TO   DO WITH IT. I THINK THE BORDERS, IT'S NOT SO DIFFERENT, IT'S AMAZING THE   WORLD IS NOT SO DIFFERENT. WE'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN BUT THE WORLD IS NOT SO DIFFERENT.  WE'RE RIGHT OVER THERE YOU GO,   MANY, MANY MILES, RIGHT IN THAT DIRECTION, AND TO BE HONEST   WITH YOU, I THINK A LOT OF IT   HAS TO DO WITH IMMIGRATION. BUT I ALSO THINK A LOT HAS TO   DO WITH THE FACT THAT THEY WANTED TO BE INDEPENDENT. THEY GET TIRED OF SEEING STUPID DECISIONS JUST LIKE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF   SEEING STUPID DECISIONS,   WHETHER IT'S THE IRAN DEAL,   WHETHER IT'S THE BORDER WHERE   PEOPLE JUST FLOW ACROSS THE BORDER LIKE SWISS CHEESE.   THEY ARE TIRING OF SEEING   STUPID DECISIONS MADE.  THEY ARE TIRED OF LOOKING AT   HORRIBLE TRADE DEALS.   YOU HAVE BAD TRADE DEALS HERE,   TOO.  I THINK THAT HAS A LOT TO DO   WITH IT.  I THINK THE BREXIT DEAL, WHEN   YOU TALK ABOUT LEAVE, I FELT, AGAIN, KNOWING THE PEOPLE HERE   VERY WELL, BUT NOT WANTING TO   GET INVOLVED, BUT I FELT THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. I FELT IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.  AND THERE IS GREAT SIMILARITIES   BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED HERE AND   MY CAMPAIGN.  PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE THEIR   COUNTRY BACK.   OK, MAYBE ONE MORE QUESTION.  I ALMOST DELAYED THIS.  BY THE WAY, THEY SAID THERE WERE GOING TO BE 2,000   PROTEVERTS. IT TURNED OUT, WE COUNTED THEM. 43.   43. AND THEY ARE WAY OVER THERE. THE POLICE DID A GREAT JOB. BUT THERE WAS NOTHING MUCH TO DO, FRANKLY.  THERE WERE 43 JUST ON THE RECORD BECAUSE WE HEARD THERE WERE GOING TO BE THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS. 43.   MY MEMBERS ARE VERY HAPPY WITH DONALD TRUMP, I CAN TELL YOU.   IS THAT A CORRECT STATEMENT? THEY LOVE DONALD TRUMP. I LOVE WHAT WE HAVE DONE HERE.  THIS IS A LITTLE BIT WHAT WE'RE   GOING TO DO TO THE UNITED   STATES.   THE UNITED STATES HAS ROTTED   INFRASTRUCTURE. ROADS CRUMBLING.  I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS A   TRUCKER, BIG TRUCKER, ONE OF   THE BIGGEST IN THE WORLD.   HE SAYS HE BUYS THESE NEW   MAGNIFICENT TRUCKS THAT COSTS   HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF   DOLLARS, AND HE'S NEVER HAD   THIS PROBLEM BEFORE. THEY ARE GETTING DESTROYED BECAUSE THE HIGHWAYS ARE LOADED UP WITH POTHOLES.   WHEN YOU HAVE AN 18-WHEELER OR   16-WHEELER AND HAVE THESE BIG   MASSIVE TRUCKS GOING DOWN THE   HIGHWAY AT 65 MILES AN HOUR, AND THEY HIT A POTHOLE AND THEY ARE LOADED UP WITH TONS OF STUFF, HE SAID THOSE TRUCKS, NO MATTER HOW GOOD THEY ARE, THEY   GET WIPED OUT.  THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY.  I THINK THIS IS SORT OF A MINI   EXAMPLE WHAT WE HAVE DONE HERE. THE MEMBERS LOVE YOU -- LOVES US.   SCOTTLAND LOVES US.   THE COUNCILMEMBER HERE, DO WE   HAVE OUR COUNCIL MEMBERS HERE? YES. THE COUNCIL HAS BEEN SO   INCREDIBLE.   IT'S BEEN A BIG LOVEFEST. WHAT WE DO IS THE UNITED STATES   NEEDS ITS INFRASTRUCTURE FIXED.   THE BRIDGES ARE A DISASTER.   THE ROADS ARE A DISAS TEMPLET   MY FRIEND TOLD ME, HE'S NEVER   HAD A PROBLEM LIKE THIS BEFORE.   HE SAID YOU GO DOWN THE   HIGHWAYS IN A BRAND NEW TRUCK THAT COSTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IS VIRTUALLY DESTROYED.  THEY HAVE TO BRING IT BACK AND   HAVE IT REHAULED BECAUSE THEY ARE HITTING POTHOLES ON HIGHWAYS.   OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRUMBLING   IN THE UNITED STATES. WE SPENT PROBABLY IF YOU ADD IT UP NOW, $4 TRILLION, MAYBE MORE   THAN THAT IN THE MIDDLE EAST,   AND WE HAVE A PROBLEM. >> THE COUNTRY IS NOT A GOLF   COURSE. MR. TRUMP: IT'S SIMILAR. IT'S A PLACE THAT HAS TO BE   FIXED. THERE'S NOBODY THAT KNOWS HOW   TO FIX THINGS LIKE ME AND   THERE'S NOBODY THAT KNOWS HOW   TO BUILD LIKE ME. I SEE YOU IN THE DARK WITH THE SIGN BEHIND YOU.  HOW ABOUT THESE TWO, SARA, GO AHEAD. >> GIVEN WHAT SARA JUST SAID,   THE NINTH PROPERTY WE HAVE BEEN  . TO TOMORROW WILL BE THE 10TH. YOU TAKE A LOT OF CRITICISM OUT   THERE FOR PEOPLE SAYING YOUR MOTIVATIONS ARE ABOUT YOUR BRAND --  MR. TRUMP: I DON'T CARE ABOUT IT.   IF IT WAS ABOUT MY BRAND I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS.  BECAUSE I HAVE GIVEN A LOT.   I HAVE GIVEN UP THE APPRENTICE,   I SAID I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT.  STEVE WANTED ME TO DO YEARS   MORE.   CONTINUES TO DO GREAT.  I HAD TO GIVE IT UP BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THIS WITH EQUAL TIME LAWS AND PROVISIONS.   I HAVE LOST CERTAIN THINGS. ESPECIALLY EARLY ON. EARLY ON I LOST MACY'S. THRILLED TO SEE THAT MACY'S   STOCK TANKED BECAUSE THEY WERE VERY DISLOYAL.  JUST OVER THE SUBJECT OF   ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION I LOST   MACY'S AN A VENDOR FOR TIES AND SHIRTS.   IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL BUT IT WAS  -- THIS IS NOT FOR BRAND.   IF I WANTED TO DO GOOD FOR THE   BRAND I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS BECAUSE WHEN YOU -- ONE THING ABOUT POLITICS, EVERYBODY LIKES   ME. RUNS YOU RUN FOR -- ONCE YOU   RUN FOR POLITICS YOU HAVE 55   FOR YOU AND 45 AGAINST.   NEVER HAD THAT BEFORE.  VERY TRFPLGT MY WIFE SAID TO ME  -- VERY INTERESTING. MY WIFE SAID TO ME, I NEVER   HEARD THIS BEFORE, SOME OF THE   CROWD WAS HOSTILE. I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU FOR MANY   YEARS ANTI-CROWD ALWAYS LOVED YOU.  NOW HALF THE CROWD HOSTILE AND   HALF THE CROWD LOVES YOU. THAT'S CALLED POLITICS. IN POLITICS IF YOU RUN FOR   OFFICE AND YOU GET 55% OF THE   VOTE, THAT'S CONSIDERED A LANDSLIDE.  THAT'S A BIG, BIG DIFFERENCE.   BUT THAT MEANS THAT 45% OF THE   PEOPLE DON'T LIKE YOU.  SO FOR MY BRAND THIS HAS NOT   BEEN A GOOD THING. ALTHOUGH LOOK WHERE WE HAVE COME.   WE STARTED OUT, WE WERE 1-17.   WE WON. WE WON.   I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO MUCH FURTHER THAN THAT. >> HOW TOUGH -- MR. TRUMP: THIS IS A TOUGH   COURSE.   SOON I WON'T BE ABLE TO BEAT   ERIC.   HE HITS THE BALL A MILE.  HE'S A VERY, VERY GOOD GOLFER.  I THINK SOON, MY DAYS ARE NUMBERED.   ONE MORE QUESTION. >> YOU GAVE A SPEECH --  >> WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE   COMMENTATORS AND MEDIA OUTLETS   THAT SAID THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN AND YOU ARE THE CHIEF BEEN   FACTORS OF BREXIT? MR. TRUMP: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT   THAT.   I THINK HE WOULD BE PROBABLY   BECAUSE I KNOW HOW HE'S BEEN   SCORNED BY CERTAIN -- TO A   CERTAIN EXTENT. CERTAINLY HE'S NOT A PERSON THAT LIKES OUR PRESIDENT VERY MUCH.   AND OUR PRESIDENT DOESN'T LIKE   HIM VERY MUCH. HE SAID SOME VERY NICE THINGS   ABOUT ME.   I THINK HE PROBABLY IS SOMEWHAT OF A BENEFICIARY. WE'LL JUST SEE HOW IT WORKS   OUT. I THINK THAT THE -- I THINK IT'S GOING TONED UP BEING A   GREAT THING. THE BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL THING   IS YOUR PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN THE COUNTRY BACK. AND THERE'S SOMETHING VERY,   VERY NICE ABOUT THAT.   AND VERY NOTED AND IT'S BEEN   PEACEFUL.   AND IT WAS STRONG AND VERY CONTENTIOUS.  IN MANY RESPECTS I WATCHED LAST   NIGHT.  IT WAS A LITTLE UGLY.   BUT IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING   PROCESS TO WATCH.   IT'S A BIG MOVE.  WHEN I CAME HERE I SAID, WHO IS   GOING TO COME OUT HERE?   IT TURNED OUT THAT PROBABLY   MORE PEOPLE CAME OUT HERE.  THERE IS A TREMENDOUS TURNOUT.  EEA LOT OF LOCAL POLITICIANS WHO DID NOT SHOW UP TODAY BECAUSE OF YOUR POLITICS.   MR. TRUMP: WE HAD THE ENTIRE   TOWN COUNCIL.   I HAVE NO IDEA.   ANYBODY ELSE?  >> MR. TRUMP --  >> YOU AND MCCASKILL FROM THE GUARDIAN. TO PICK UP ENOUGH POINTS.   DAVID CAMERON SAID HE DIDN'T   WANT TO MEET YOU.   MR. TRUMP: WHERE IS DAVID CAMERON RIGHT NOW?  NO, EXCUSE ME.  DAVID CAMERON WOULD HAVE MET   ME.   DAVID CAMERON WAS NEGOTIATING TO MEET ME. BUT RIGHT NOW I DON'T THINK   DAVID CAMERON WANTS TO MEET ANYBODY. KATIE? >> THE LABOR PARTIES, YOU'RE REGARDED AS TOXIC. MR. TRUMP: I THINK WHAT   HAPPENED, I THINK WE HAVE A NASTY DAY.  I THINK WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE REALLY RESPECT WHAT I DID.  I TOOK ONE OF THE GREAT ASSETS OF SCOTLAND AND BROUGHT IT BACK   TO A LEVEL THAT IT'S NEVER EVEN   SEEN.   AS GREAT AS TURNBERRY HAS BEEN OVER THE YEARS, IT'S BEEN ONE   OF THE GREAT OVER THE WORLD,   IT'S NOW AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN   IT'S EVER BEEN.   IT'S NEVER SEEN THESE LEVELS BEFORE.   WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT. ONE MORE.   KATIE? >> TODAY'S VOTE TO BE AN   ENDORSEMENT OF YOUR IMMIGRATION   POLICIES OR IDEAS AND YOUR -- AT SOME POINT EXTREME RHETORIC WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING A   WALL, OR BANNING MUSLIMS FROM   COMING TO AMERICA?  ARE YOU GOING TO CONTINUE ON   WITH THAT?  MR. TRUMP: IT'S MOVING ALONG. ALL I DO I DO THE RIGHT THING. I'M DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY. IT RESONATES BECAUSE I HAVE A   TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF BACKERS   AND SUPPORT. >> IS TODAY'S VOTE HERE AN   INDICATOR FOR YOU THAT YOUR RHETORIC AND EXTREME RHETORIC   IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD -- MR. TRUMP: I DON'T THINK I HAVE   EXTREME RHETORIC. I DON'T KNOW. I THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED I   WAS WATCHING SOME OF THE   COMMENTATORS BEFORE, AND A LOT   OF THEM WERE SAYING THAT. I'M NOT SURE IT MATTERS FROM MY STANDPOINT.   I THINK IT DOES SHOW SOMETHING   ABOUT THE PEOPLE WANTING THEIR   COUNTRY BACK. I CAN TELL YOU IN THE UNITED   STATES THE PEOPLE WANT THEIR COUNTRY BACK.   IN THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE   WANT SMART DECISIONS, NOT DUMB DECISIONS.  AND WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN DUMB   DECISIONS FOR MANY YEARS AND   THE PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF IT. AND I HAVE A FEELING THE SAME   THING HAS HAPPENED OVER YEAR   AND THAT'S WHY YOU HAD THE RESULT YOU HAD.   I LOVE YOU-ALL.   THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  THANK YOU TO MY MEMBERS AND   THANK YOU TO THE COUNCIL.   THE COUNCIL HAS BEEN AMAZING.   THANK YOU FOR ALL BEING HERE.   THANK YOU.      MR. TRUMP: WE'RE GOING TO DO A   RIBBON CUTTING. WHERE ARE THE COUNCIL PEOPLE? WHERE ARE THEY?   GET SOME OF THEM IF YOU WANT. SHE'S TOUGH. WHOA.    MR. TRUMP: WE DO IT ON THREE.   ONE, TWO, THREE -- BECAUSE PLAUSE --   MR. TRUMP: THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.  THANK YOU.   >> WITH THE","Donald Trump News Conference in Turnberry, Scotland"

SO WE BELIEVE THIS CONFERENCE AND OTHERS LIKE THIS ACROSS THE   COUNTRY ARE KEY COGS IN HELPING   TO FACILITATE THAT. AS WE GET STARTED, WE BEGIN THE   PROGRAM, I WANT TO LAY A FEW   KIND OF GROUND RULES HERE. OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS BEEN A SPIRITED PRIMARY SEASON AND WILL  CONTINUE TO BE A FASCINATING PROCESS AS WE MOVE INTO THE GENERAL SESSION.

I ASK THAT YOU JOIN DR. W.A.   MERIT OF THE SOUTHERN LEADERSHIP  CONFERENCE IN NORTH CAROLINA TO   LEAD US IN PRAYER.  >> GOOD MORNING.

AND THE ROCKETS'  RED GLARE  THE BOMBS BURSTING  IN AIR   GAVE PROOF  THROUGH THE NIGHT  THAT OUR FLAG  WAS STILL THERE   OH, SAY, DOES THAT  STAR-SPANGLED BANNER YET WAVE   O'ER THE LAND  OF THE FREE   AND THE HOME  OF THE BRAVE?  >  >>> PLEASE WELCOME TO THE STAGE FROM THE GREAT STATE OF   TENNESSEE, REPRESENTATIVE MARCIA  BLACKBORN.  >> GOOD MORNING!  I TELL YOU WHAT, I AM ABSOLUTELY THRILLED TO BE HERE WITH YOU THIS MORNING. HOW WONDERFUL TO SEE SO MANY   CONSERVATIVES TO GET EQUIPPED   AND READY FOR THE BATTLE BECAUSE  THIS IS A FIGHT THAT WE HAVE TO WIN.  AND BEING HERE, YOU ARE LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR GOING OUT THERE AND BEING THE FOOT   SOLDIERS. WE AS CONSERVATIVES, WE KNOW IF   WE FOCUS ON PERSONALITIES, WE   LOSE EVERY TIME.  IF WE FOCUS ON ISSUES AND FOCUS   ON THE CONSTITUTION, WE WIN.  I WANT TO BRING YOU UP TO DATE ON SOME WORK THAT WE ARE DOING   IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. EVERYBODY REMEMBERS THE VIDEOS THAT CAME OUT LAST YEAR AND WITH  EVERY VIDEO WE GOT A LITTLE BIT   MORE INSIGHT INTO WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH BIG ABORTION. WE GOT A VIEW OF DOCTORS WHO WERE WILLING TO SELL BABY BODY PARTS FOR MONEY.  A VIEW OF CLINICS AND MILLIONS   THAT WERE MARKETING BODY PARTS ONLINE, A VIEW THAT EXPLOITS   YOUNG WOMEN AND SEES THEIR   BABIES AS A PROFIT CENTER. MANY OF YOU SAID, WHAT ARE YOU   GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IS DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  >> WE CAN'T HEAR YOU.  >> YOU CAN'T HEAR ME.  THE MICROPHONE IS NOT ON. SO LET'S SEE.  CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?  ALL RIGHT. WE'LL DO IT THIS WAY THEN. THE VIDEOS IS WHAT EVERYBODY SAW.  AND YOU WANTED US TO DO   SOMETHING ABOUT IT ON OCTOBER 7th, 2015.  THE HOUSE PASSED A RESOLUTION. IT ESTABLISHED THE SELECT INVESTIGATIVE PANEL ON INFANT LIVES.  AND WE WERE DIRECTED TO INVESTIGATE THE ISSUES RELATED TO ACQUISITION AND TRANSFER FOR   RESALE OF FETAL TISSUE TO   RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND RELATED MANNERS.  TAKE A LOOK AT THE CORE LANGUAGE OF THE RESOLUTION.  IT IS NOT THE USUAL CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY. THIS IS ABOUT EXACTING DETAIL, EVIDENCE, ACCOUNTING PRACTICES,   BUSINESS RECORDS, BANK RECORDS.  IT IS ABOUT SUBPOENAS AND DEPOSITIONS. LET ME GIVE YOU A SNAPSHOT OF   THE ABORTION BIZ AND THE FETAL   TISSUE INDUSTRY.  THERE ARE CURRENTLY 512 SURGICAL ABORTION CLINICS, 218 ARE RU-486 CLINICS.  118 DOCTORS WHO PERFORM ABORTIONS.  THERE ARE EIGHT PROCUREMENT   BUSINESSES WE HAVE UNDER SCRUTINY, COMPANIES THAT PAY   MONEY FOR TISSUE AND RESELL IT.  THESE COMPANIES HAVE HUNDREDS OF CUSTOMERS. AND THE TRANSACTIONS AND WHEN I   SAY TRANSACTION, THIS MEANS   INDIVIDUAL SALES OF BABY BODY PARTS FOR MONEY.  THOSE TRANSACTIONS NUMBER IN THE  THOUSANDS. THE AVERAGE PRICE PAID TO THE   ABORTION CLINIC FOR TISSUE IS  $50. THE AVERAGE RESALE PRICE IS  $700. SOMETIMES HIGHER.  THE INVESTIGATION MUST BE   EXACTING BECAUSE SELLING BABY BODY PARTS FOR A PROFIT IS A   VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW.  IT IS A TEN-YEAR FELONY. THIS STATUTE WAS PASSED AS A   HENRY WAXMAN AMENDMENT IN 1993.  IT IS A BASING ACCOUNTING   STATUTE. SELL THE BABY BODY PART FOR A   PROFIT, AND YOU ARE IN VIOLATION  OF THE LAW.  DONATE THE BODY PARTS, YOU'RE WITHIN THE LAW.  THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVE ISSUED SUBPOENAS, 36 SUBPOENAS TO DATE AND WE HAD VERY LITTLE COOPERATION FROM BIG ABORTION.  WE GET DOCUMENTS REDACTED, THEY'RE MISSING ALSO, THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE COMPLIANCE FROM THE   MIDDLE MAN.  PEOPLE HAVE SAID TO US WE WILL   NOT COMPLY WITH THE   CONGRESSIONAL SUBPOENAS, SOME   PEOPLE HAVE SAID START THE   CONTEMPT PROCESS AND I PLAN TO   DO EXACTLY THAT. THESE SUBPOENAS WILL BE ENFORCED.  AND OUR FIRST HEARING ON THE BIOETHICS, THE DEMOCRATS AGREED THAT NOBODY SHOULD SELL A BABY BODY PART FOR A PROFIT. THEIR STAR WITNESS ADMITTED THAT  OUTSIDE OF A FEW EARLY VACCINES,  NO CURES HAD COME FROM FETAL TISSUE RESEARCH.  THEY AGREED THAT NO ONE SHOULD   BE ABLE TO GET PREGNANT FOR THE   PURPOSE OF MAKING A FETAL TISSUE DONATION.  THE WITNESSES INCLUDING A DEMOCRAT ALL AGREED THAT THE   CONSENT FORM USED IS VERY MISLEADING.  THEY AGREED THAT IT WOULD BE A LEGAL AND ETHICAL VIOLATION FOR AN ABORTION CLINIC AND RESEARCHER TO DECEIVE THE BOARD   CALLED AN INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD THAT BY LAW REVIEWS FETAL   TISSUE RESEARCH.  AT OUR SECOND HEARING ON THE   PRICING OF FETAL TISSUE, TWO   FORMER U.S. ATTORNEYS AGREED THAT OUR INVESTIGATION HAD   PRODUCED EVIDENCE THAT ABORTION   CLINICS AND THE MIDDLE MEN WERE   PROFITING FROM THE SALE OF PARTS.  ALL OF THE PANELISTS AGREED THAT WE NEEDED THE ACCOUNTING RECORDS AND BANK RECORDS FROM THE MIDDLE MAN.  THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE   SUBPOENAS. I WANT TO SHOW YOU A BUSINESS BROCHURE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY BONE  CHILLING.  TAKE A GOOD HARD LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS A STEM EXPRESS OFFERED   TO THE ABORTION CLINICS TO ADD A PROFIT CENTER TO THEIR CLINIC.  WE GOT THE LANGUAGE HIGHLIGHTED THERE. AND YOU CAN SEE THEY ADD THE   SELLING OF BABY BODY PARTS FOR PROFIT.  NOW, TAKE A LOOK AT THE WEBSITE THAT GOES WITH THE BROCHURE THIS.  THIS IS PLACE WHERE STEM EXPRESS  SELLS THE BABY BODY PARTS WITH EVERYTHING LISTED, BRAIN, HEART,  LUNG, LIVER, TONGUE, SCALP. CLICK ON WHAT YOU WANT, CLICK ON  THE GESTATION PERIOD YOU WANT,   CLICK ON THE DATE YOU WANT IT, AND THEN PROCEED TO CHECK OUT TO  PICK YOUR FORM OF SHIPPING.  IT REALLY IS BABY PARTS ON   DEMAND. THIS IS BIG ABORTION TODAY. LONG GONE IS THE LIE OF LEGAL,   SAFE AND RARE.  IN BIG ABORTION, THE BABY IS A PROFIT CENTER.  WHATEVER THE COST.  LOOK AT THESE INVOICES.  MONEY PAID TO THE CLINICS FOR   EACH BODY PART.  MONEY PAID TO THE PROCUREMENT   COMPANY AND THERE ARE MANY PROCUREMENT COMPANIES BESIDES   STEM EXPRESS.  IT IS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY. DOES IT MATTER THAT ABORTION   BUSINESS EXPLOITS FRIGHTENED YOUNG WOMEN FACING A LIFE CHANGING DECISION.  DOES IT MATTER THAT ABORTION   CLINICS AND STEM EXPRESS VIOLATE  HIPAA PRIVACY?  DOES IT MATTER THAT EVERY ONE OF  THESE ACTIONS DEGRADES THE RULES  AND THE DIGNITY OF OUR ORGAN DONATION? YES, IT DOES MATTER. ON THE SCREEN YOU'VE GOT COPIES OF LETTERS THAT I'VE SENT TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH AND   HUMAN SERVICES. OVER 70 PAGES OF DOCUMENTED   EVIDENCE OF VIOLATIONS. YOU CAN READ THEM ALL ON OUR WEBSITE.  I'M NOT ALONE IN THIS EFFORT.  I CHAIR THE SELECT INVESTIGATIVE  PANEL AND IT IS FULL OF SOME   WONDERFUL MEMBERS. I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR TEAM.  WE HAVE GOT DOCTORS, FORMER NURSE, A PROSECUTOR, WE'RE A   STRONG PRO LIFE TEAM. YOU HAVE JOE PITTS FROM PENNSYLVANIA. DIANE BLACK FROM TENNESSEE. LARRY BUSHON, INDIANA, DR. ANDY HARRIS, VICKY HARTZLER AND MIA   LOVE, STRONG, PRO-LIFE MEMBERS.  THEIR EFFORTS MATTER TO ME AND I  KNOW THAT THEY MATTER TO YOU.  AND KNOWING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE   DOING IN THE HOUSE IS ALL PART   OF YOUR EQUIPPING FOR THE FIGHT.  THIS YEAR MATTERS.  I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT ON   APRIL 3rd, HILLARY CLINTON SAID, SHE SAID THIS ON ""MEET THE PRESS,"" THAT THE, QUOTE, UNBORN   PERSON, END QUOTE, DOESN'T HAVE   CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.  THINK ABOUT HOW STRIKINGLY CALLOUS THAT IS. THE UNBORN PERSON DOESN'T HAVE   CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. THE ANALYTICAL COLDNESS WITH   WHICH SHE DISMISSED RIGHTS FOR UNBORN CHILDREN REVEALS A   HARDENED CORE THAT IS SHOCKING. ABORTION RESTRICTIONS ARE IN PLACE  PLACE.  THEY ARE IN LAW SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE UNBORN CHILDREN HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. WHAT IS EVEN MORE TROUBLING TO   ME IS THAT HER COMMENTS MAY SIGNAL HER INTENTION, MUCH THE   SAME WAY PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS USED EXECUTIVE ORDERS ON   IMMIGRATIONS TO USE EXECUTIVE ACTION TO BLOCK EVEN MINIMAL   PROTECTIONS OF LIFE AT ITS MOST VULNERABLE STAGE.  SO HERE IS OUR WEBSITE.  I WANT EACH OF YOU TO GET   INVOLVED TO TELL OTHERS, TO WRITE LET STERLETTERS, GO ON OUR   WEBSITE, PULL DOWN THE DOCUMENTS  I'VE SHOWN YOU TODAY, AND I WANT TO OFFER TO YOU A CALL TO ACTION.  ONE OF OUR FOUNDING FATHERS,   DR. JOSEPH BORN, WHO IS PRESIDENT OF THE MASSACHUSETTS ASSEMBLY, THE MILITIA, GAVE THE CHARGE, AND THE COMMAND, AS THEY HEADED TO BUNKER HILL WHERE HE LOST HIS LIFE.  HERE IS WHAT HE SAID.  YOU ARE TO DECIDE THE IMPORTANT   QUESTIONS UPON WHICH RESTS THE   HAPPINESS AND LIBERTY OF   MILLIONS YET UNBORN. ACT WORTHY OF YOURSELVES.  FOR US TODAY, AS CONSERVATIVES, STEPPING UP IN THIS ELECTION SEASON, EQUIPPING FOR THE TASK   AT HAND, FOCUSING ON THE ISSUES, AND MAKING CERTAIN THAT WE ARE THERE TO PROTECT LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THAT IS OUR CHARGE IN THIS ELECTION SEASON. MAY GOD BLESS YOU. MAY HE BLESS YOUR WEEKEND.  AND EQUIP YOU FOR A WINNING, A   VICTORIOUS MONTHS AHEAD.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE   HELP ME WELCOME TO THE STAKE   FROM THE GREAT STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA, CONGRESSMAN ALEX MOODY.  >> THANK YOU, SUCH A PLEASURE TO  BE WITH YOU, BRIGHT AND EARLY   AND CONGRATULATIONS FOR YOUR   EFFORTS IN BEING PART OF THIS   EFFORT TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK FROM THE FAR LEFT WHO IS INTENT   ON RUINING IT AND MAKING IT SOME  SORT OF SOCIALIST UTOPIA THAT   WILL BE A COMPLETE FAILURE.  I'M ALEX MOODY.  FIRST TERM IN CONGRESS FROM THE   GREAT STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA. I'VE BEEN PASSIONATE ABOUT THE   POLITICAL PROCESS MY ENTIRE LIFE.  MY FATHER SERVED IN VIETNAM AS   AN ARMY CAPTAIN, RECEIVED THE BRONZE STAR AND VERY POLITICAL AND RAISED ME TO BELIEVE IN   FIGHTING FOR OUR COUNTRY.  MY MOTHER, WHEN SHE TURNED 20 YEARS OLD, WAS SITTING IN A   PRISON CELL IN FIDEL CASTRO'S   CUBA.  MY MOTHER WAS BORN AND RAISED IN  CUBA.  WHEN THE BAY OF PIGS INVASION   FAILED, THEY LOCKED EVERYBODY UP  THAT WASN'T A COMMUNIST AND SHE WAS FORCED TO BE ABLE TO FLEE AND BE ABLE TO BE ACCEPTED INTO THIS COUNTRY.  SHE SAW AN ENTIRE COUNTRY TAKEN   FROM HER BY A DESPOTIC DICTATOR, AN EVIL PERSON, BECAUSE THERE IS  GOOD AND EVIL IN THIS WORLD.  SOME PEOPLE WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE IT IS JUST DIFFERENCES OF OPINIONS AND THERE IS NO   OBJECTIVE TRUTH AND ALL   SUBJECTIVE AND RIGHT AND WRONG   DIFFERS FOR EVERY PERSON.  THAT IS NOT TRUE.  THERE IS GOOD IN THIS WORLD.  THERE IS EVIL IN THIS WORLD.  THERE IS EVIL RIGHT HERE IN THIS COUNTRY AS CONGRESSWOMAN   BLACKBURN TALKED ABOUT THE KILLING OF CHILDREN.  WE ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT FIGHTING  BACK AGAINST THIS AS ARE YOU   BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE.  MY PARENTS RAISED ME TO GET INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS IN A YOUNG AGE.  I BELIEVE IT IS EVERYBODY'S DUTY TO GET INVOLVED SOME WAY OR ANOTHER.  FOR EXAMPLE, AS AN ABSOLUTE   MINIMUM, EVERYBODY SHOULD VOTE.  EVERYONE SEEMS TO AGREE,   EVERYONE SHOULD VOTE. WE ALL KNOW PEOPLE AND OUR   FAMILY, NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS AND CHURCH WHO ACTUALLY DON'T VOTE.  EVEN IN PRESIDENTIAL YEARS SOME   PEOPLE DON'T VOTE.  AS ABSOLUTE MINIMUM, PEOPLE   SHOULD VOTE. THERE IS OTHER I WAS TO GETWAYS TO GET   INVOLVED. YOU CAN VOLUNTEER, SUPPORTING CANDIDATES, SUPPORTING CAUSES. I APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT.  IT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED.  FRANKLY, I THINK RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE FACING IN THIS COUNTRY IS   CLOSE TO A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS.  WE HAVE A PRESIDENT, AN   EXECUTIVE, WHO THINKS HE CAN   MAKE THE LAWS.  AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY THIS SYSTEM WORKS.  THE FOUNDERS OF OUR COUNTRY   WISELY SET UP A SYSTEM OF THREE   CO-EQUAL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT.  THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED   STATES ENFORCES THE LAWS, HE   DOES NOT MAKE UP THE LAWS HIMSELF. AND GO AROUND CONGRESS TO DO SO.  AND THIS HAS BECOME QUITE A DIFFICULT BATTLE IN THE CONGRESS  RIGHT NOW.  MY STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA, COAL   IS THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCT,   DRIVES THIS ECONOMY.  THE PRESIDENT DECIDED HE'LL   DECLARE A WAR ON COAL.  HE'LL USE THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR OR ANY   OTHER MEANS OF HIS DISPOSAL TO   TRY TO SHUT DOWN THE COAL INDUSTRY BECAUSE OF A RADICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL AGENDA NOT   BASED ON SCIENCE.  HE'S BEEN PROSECUTING THIS WAR   FOR A LONG TIME, COSTING GOOD   PAYING JOBS FOR FAMILIES FOR A   POLITICAL AGENDA.  ONE OF MY FAVORITE BATTLES IN   CONGRESS, I'M IN MY FRESHMAN   YEAR, THERE A YEAR AND A HALF, YOU MAY RECALL FEBRUARY OF LAST   YEAR, PRESIDENT OBAMA DECIDED TO DECLARE EXECUTIVE AMNESTY BY   EXECUTIVE ORDER.  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WERE TOLD   THEY CAN STAY, WHICH IS AGAINST   OUR LAW IN THIS COUNTRY. YOU DO THAT BY EXECUTIVE ORDER.  AND ONE OF THE THINGS SO SCARY   ABOUT THAT IS PRESIDENT OBAMA HIMSELF HAD SAID NO FEWER THAN 22 TIMES THAT HE LACKED THE AUTHORITY UNDER THE CONSTITUTION  TO DO THAT BY HIMSELF.  WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING TO DIFFERENT GROUPS, HE WOULD SPEAK  TO LEFT WING GROUPS HERE TODAY, SPEAKING TO A CONSERVATIVE GROUP, HE WOULD SPEAK TO LIBERAL GROUPS, HE WOULD -- PEOPLE WOULD  ASK WHY DON'T YOU DO EXECUTIVE AMNESTY BY ILLEGAL AMNESTY BY EXECUTIVE ORDER.  HE SAID I DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO IT.  HE USE ED TERMS LIKE I'M NOT A   KING.  I'M NOT A DICTATOR. I'M NOT THE EMPEROR OF THE   UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  I'M THE PRESIDENT AND THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS. HE SAID IT NO FEWER THAN 22 TIMES.  EVERYONE KNEW THE PRESIDENT   LACKED THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT   AND HE DID IT ANYWAY.  THAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IS A  SCARY THING.  THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT HAVE THAT POWER.  SO PART OF THE BATTLE WE HAVE   BEEN SEEING AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING IT IS IN CONGRESS SIMPLY TO ASSERT OURSELVES AND STAND UP FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS THAT WE HAVE. I'VE GOTTEN VERY FAMILIAR WITH ARTICLE ONE, SECTION 7 OF THE   UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION,   WHICH SAYS THE POWER TO RAISE REVENUE, THE POWER OF THE PURSE,  KNOWN AS THE POWER OF THE PURSE,  LIES SPECIFICALLY WITH THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.  WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES GETS OUT OF CONTROL AND   STARTS GOING AROUND CONGRESS AND  MAKING UP LAWS THROUGH THE RULE-MAKING PROCESS OF HIS DEPARTMENTS AND THROUGH   EXECUTIVE ORDERS, CONGRESS WAS   EMPOWERED BY THE FOUNDERS OF OUR  COUNTRY TO STOP HIM THROUGH THE POWER OF PURSE.  WE SIMPLY NEED TO DO THAT.  THANK YOU.  THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK   ABOUT HAVING STUDY COMMISSIONS   AND HOW TO DO A TASK FORCE TO   EXAMINE HOW TO CONTROL THE   PRESIDENT AND MAINTAIN THE POWER  OF CONGRESS.  WE DON'T NEED ALL THAT.  IT IS RIGHT THERE.  WE HAVE IT. WE SIMPLY HAVE TO DO IT. SOMEONE IS ESSENTIALLY BEING A   BULLY, THIS ISN'T A PARTISAN COMMENT, THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE POWER TO DO THESE THINGS.  WE'LL HAVE ELECTION NEXT YEAR, THE NEW PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE   THE POWER TO GO AROUND CONGRESS. THIS IS A CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE FOR THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. SO WE NEED TO ASSERT OURSELVES, WE HAVE SOME DIFFERENCES ON   TACTICS IN CONGRESS, BUT NOT   DIFFERENCES ON THE PRINCIPLES.  WHAT HAS BEEN VERY INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING   AND IT IS SO FRUSTRATING, I KNOW  IT IS FRUSTRATING TO YOU, IS   WHEN THE HOUSE PASSES BILLS, AND  WE HAVE THE LARGEST CONSERVATIVE  MAJORITY AND 247 REPUBLICANS AND 188 DEMOCRATS, THAT'S THE   LARGEST REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN   EIGHT YEARS AND IT HAS BEEN   FRUSTRATING TO SEE US PASS BILLS  THAT HAVE U.S. SENATE ABUSE THE FILIBUSTER RULE.  THE MINORITY PARTY, THE MINORITY  PARTY, NOT THE MAJORITY PARTY,   LIKE EVERYONE TO THINK THE MAJORITY PARTY BUT THEY'RE NOT, THE MINORITY PARTY LED BY HARRY REID FILIBUSTERS EVERYTHING.  NEEDS 60 VOTES TO PASS SOMETHING OVER THERE.  WE NEED TO PUT THAT ON THE FLOOR AND MAKE THEM FILIBUSTER IT SO   THE WORLD CAN SEE THE OBSTRUCTIONIST TACTICS THEY'RE   USING.  THEY'RE ATTEMPTING TO SHUT DOWN   GOVERNMENT AND TRY TO BLAME THE MAJORITY PARTY FOR THAT WHICH IS  UNFAIR.  AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS  BEEN A BATTLE FOR US TO PUSH   BACK AGAINST. WHEN WE PASS OUR BILLS IN THE   HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, WE   SHOULD WAIT UNTIL THE SENATE   ACTS AND THEN APPOINT A   CONFERENCE COMMITTEE.  BUT FOR US TO PASS GOOD BILLS,   BILLS THAT REIGN IN REGULATION, APPROPRIATIONS BILLS, WE'RE   DOING THAT RIGHT NOW, WE'RE   DOING IT THIS WEEK, WE'RE DOING IT NEXT WEEK, WE'RE PASSING   APPROPRIATIONS BILLS ONE AT A   TIME WITH RIDERS, DEFUNDING   PLANNED PARENTHOOD, THINGS THIS   STOP THE WAR ON COAL -- THANK   YOU. AND VARIOUS OTHER RIDERS. BUT THOSE ARE POLICIES SO WE SAY YOU CAN'T TAKE THE MONEY AND GO   AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  WHAT CONGRESS WAS ELECTED TO DO.  I LIKE TO SAY IF THE PEOPLE IN   THIS COUNTRY WANTED EVERYTHING   BARACK OBAMA IS DOING TO GO UNCHECKED, HE WOULD HAVE PUT   NANCY PELOSI AS SPEAKER OF THE   HOUSE. AND YOU RECALL SHE WAS SPEAKER FOR A FEW YEARS. BUT THEY DIDN'T DO THAT.  THEY DIDN'T PUT HER AS SPEAKER   OF THE HOUSE.  THEY PUT PAUL RYAN AND US IN CHARGE OF THE HOUSE. THE VOTERS ARE TO ASK FOR THE   CHECK AND BALANCE, WE CAN'T GET EVERYTHING, BUT THERE IS A LOT WE CAN DO.  FOR EXAMPLE, ONE VICTORY WE DID HAVE LATE LAST YEAR, WE PASSED THE BILL IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE TO REPEAL OBAMACARE COMPLETELY. THANK YOU.  COMPLETELY. EVERY WORD OF IT.  AND WE USED THE BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT, PROCEDURES WE CAN USE TO GET AROUND THE SENATE FILIBUSTER, SPECIFICALLY   ON A FEW THINGS, THAT'S WHAT WE DID.  WE PASSED THAT WITH ALL   REPUBLICAN VOTES.  NO DEMOCRAT VOTES.  AND WE PASSED THE BILL TO REPEAL  OBAMACARE COMPLETELY.  WENT TO THE PRESIDENT'S DESK.  AS EXPECTED, PRESIDENT OBAMA   VETOED THE BILL.  WE WERE TRYING TO SEND THE   AMERICAN PUBLIC A MESSAGE.  IF YOU GIVE US A NEW PRESIDENT, ONE NOT FOR OBAMACARE, WE CAN   REPEAL THAT COMPLETELY.  WE CAN DO IT.  WE'LL DO IT PROBABLY -- AND REST ASSURED IF WE MAINTAIN A   CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY IN THE   HOUSE AND THE SENATE, THE FIRST   THINGS WE'RE GOING TO DO NEXT   YEAR IS REPEAL THAT BILL COMPLETELY.  YOU'LL SEE THAT ON THE DESK OF   THE PRESIDENT.  THANK YOU.  I KNOW THERE SAY LOT OF   FRUSTRATION OUT THERE.  AND A LOT OF DOUBT.  WHEN I WAS SEEKING ELECTION TO   THE OFFICE, THE NUMBER ONE   SKEPTICISM I THIS IS THAT WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AT ALL.  BUT WE ARE FIGHTING HARD AND WITH YOUR HELP WE WILL CONTINUE   TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR OUR   VALUES AS PEOPLE BELIEVE IN TRADITIONAL JUDEO-CHRISTIAN VALUES AND LESS GOVERNMENT AND   FREEDOM AND FREE ENTERPRISE AND   STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE. ANYWAY, THANK YOU FOR COMING. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONVENING WITH  YOU. GOD BLESS.  >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HELP ME  WELCOME TO THE STAGE SAVANNA BERRY, LIBERTY UNIVERSITY YOUNG WOMEN FOR AMERICA PRESIDENT.  >> HELLO.  I'M HERE TO INTRODUCE OUR NEXT SPEAKER, CONGRESSWOMAN VIRGINIA   FOX, FROM THE FIFTH DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA. CONGRESSWOMAN FOX WAS FIRST   ELECTED TO CONGRESS IN 2005 AND PRIOR TO THAT SERVED AS THE   SENATOR IN NORTH CAROLINA'S LEGISLATURE FOR TEN YEARS. CONGRESSWOMAN FOX ESTABLISHED HERSELF AS A CHAMPION OF   CONSERVATIVE VALUES IN BOTH   CONGRESS AND THE NORTH CAROLINA SENATE.  HOWEVER, MOST NOTABLY SHE HAS   BEEN ONE OF THE MOST FEARLESS   LEADERS IN CONGRESS WHEN IT   COMES TO THE PRO-LIFE ISSUE. WITHOUT FAIL, IT HAS BEEN SAID OF HER SHE'S ONE OF THE MOST DEDICATED, UNWAVERING, PERSISTENT AND HARD WORKING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHEN IT   COMES TO THE ISSUE OF PRO-LIFE.  AND THIS HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY  EVIDENT WITH HER LEADERSHIP WHEN  IT COMES TO THE FIGHT FOR THE 20  WEEK BAN.  AS SHE WAS ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THAT LED THE FIGHT FOR   THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION ON THE HOUSE FLOOR.  AS A YOUNG PRO-LIFE WOMAN, I AM   SO GLAD TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE HER  SETTING AN EXAMPLE OF FEARLESS   AND SELFLESS LEADERSHIP IN CONGRESS.  PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING FROM  THE GREAT STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, CONGRESSWOMAN VIRGINIA FOX.  >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SAVANNAH.  I APPRECIATE THAT.  I TOLD SAVANNA BACKSTAGE THAT YOUNG WOMAN WHO RUNS MY OFFICE IS A LIBERTY GRAD, SHE CAME TO   ME AS AN INTERN ABOUT 11 YEARS AGO, AND FIRST DAY -- FIRST FEW   MINUTES I TALKED WITH HER, SHE   GOT ME SOME INFORMATION.  I SAID TO MY CHIEF OF STAFF,   THAT WOMAN IS STAYING HERE AS   LONG AS I'M HERE.  SO YOU KEEP HER AND SHE STAYED   AND I'M SO GRATEFUL TO HER.  WE LOVE THE LIBERTY GRADS.  WE REALLY DO.  I WANT TO SAY THAT IT IS A GREAT  HONOR TO BE WITH YOU THIS MORNING.  AND ESPECIALLY AS I HAVE SEEN   THE LIST OF SPEAKERS AND HEARD   ALREADY A COUPLE OF MY COLLEAGUES SPEAKING TO YOU AND SOME MORE BACK IN THE BACK   GETTING READY TO COME SPEAK TO   YOU I THINK YOU WILL SEE WHAT A   WONDERFUL GROUP OF REPUBLICAN MEMBERS WE HAVE IN THE CONGRESS. YOU'LL SEE THAT WE ARE VERY   STRONGLY COMMITTED TO FAITH AND FREEDOM IN OUR COUNTRY.  AND WE ARE LEADING THE FIGHT IN   THIS AREA.  BUT WE NEED FOLKS LIKE YOU OUT   THERE IN THE HINTERLANDS HELPING BACK US UP WITH THIS.  SO I WANT TO SAY TO YOU, IT IS AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU AND I   WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU AS THE OTHER MEMBERS HAVE ENCOURAGED YOU AND I'M SURE THE MEMBERS COMING AFTER ME WILL TO STAY   INVOLVED, AND GET EVEN MORE INVOLVED.  I AGREE, EVERYBODY CAN DO   SOMETHING. WHEN I GET LETTERS FROM PEOPLE IN MY OFFICE, AND I READ MY OWN MAIL AND ANSWER MY OWN MAIL, SO   I STAY UP WITH WHAT IS GOING ON,  AND PEOPLE SAY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT PRESIDENT   OBAMA?  WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS?  I TURN IT RIGHT BACK AROUND AND   I SAY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO   BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO THIS ALONE IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED   STATES.  WE HAVE TO HAVE EVERYBODY INVOLVED.  I'M SO DELIGHTED THAT MARSHA   TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THE SELECT INVESTIGATIVE PANEL ON INFANT LIVES.  I'M THE ONE WHO ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED THAT BILL.  AND I WANT TO TELL YOU IT IS A   PRIME EXAMPLE OF ONE OF OUR MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE   CONGRESS THAT IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED. AND THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY   OF OVERSIGHT OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. AND YOU NOW HOW DYSFUNCTIONAL   CONGRESS IS ALL THE TIME, THAT'S  ALL THE PRESS NEEDS TO TALK ABOUT IS BECAUSE REPUBLICANS ARE  IN CHARGE, DYSFUNCTIONAL, THAT'S NOT TRUE.  DON'T BUY INTO THAT. I ASKED RECENTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE   WERE SAYING WHY CAN'T YOU GET ALONG DO YOU KNOW 99% OF OUR   BILLS NEED PASSED WITH   BIPARTISAN SUPPORT BECAUSE WE DO WORK TOGETHER AND WE HAVE   BETWEEN 20 AND 80 HEARINGS A   WEEK AND YOU NEVER HEAR ABOUT THAT. WE'RE PASSING LEGISLATION.  BUT ALSO WE HAVE LOTS OF COMMITTEES DOING THEIR WORK IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT OF THE   EXECUTIVE BRANCH. WE'RE DELVING INTO WHAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS DOING AND   HOW IT IS EITHER DOING ITS WORK RIGHT OR IN THE DOING ITS WORK   RIGHT, AS WELL AS AGENCIES THAT GET MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL   GOVERNMENT. LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD.  AND THAT'S PART OF OUR   RESPONSIBILITY. I THINK WE'RE DOING IT VERY   WELL.  I DO WANT TO TELL YOU AGAIN,   VERY BRIEFLY, YOU'RE GOING TO   HEAR FROM A VARIETY OF US AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, I HOPE TO INSPIRE THE YOUNG PEOPLE HERE,   LIKE SAVANNA, YOU MIGHT THINK   THAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS COME FROM RARIFIED BACKGROUNDS.  BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, I GREW   UP IN WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA IN   A HOUSE WITH NO ELECTRICITY AND NO RUNNING WATER. MY MOTHER HAD A 6th GRADE EDUCATION AND I TELL PEOPLE I'M NOT TELLING YOU THAT TO COMPLAIN  OR BRAG. I'M ONLY SAYING THAT WE LIVE IN THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WORLD.  AND I WAS ASKED THIS MORNING ON   A RADIO SHOW IF I WERE GIVING A   COMMENCEMENT SPEECH RIGHT NOW, COMMENCEMENT SEASON, WHAT WOULD   I SAY TO YOUNG PEOPLE.  AND I WOULD SAY THAT TO THEM.  WAKE UP, OPEN YOUR EYES, AND REALIZE YOU LIVE IN THE GREATEST  COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE YOU   HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO   EXERCISE THE GOD GIVEN SKILLS AND TALENTS YOU HAVE TO BE   WHATEVER IT IS YOU WANT TO BE.  NOW I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I WAS SURVIVING.  THAT'S ALL I WAS FOCUSED ON.  I DID NOT KNOW GOD WOULD LEAD ME  TO WHERE HE HAS LED ME. BUT I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT I COULD NOT BE IN THE CONGRESS OF   THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT THE   HAND OF GOD GUIDING ME AND BRINGING ME HERE.  AND SO -- AND AS OTHERS HAVE   ALLUDED TO, I LOVE THE TITLE OF YOUR GROUP, FAITH AND FREEDOM. WE ALL KNOW THAT'S HOW OUR   COUNTRY WAS FORMED WAS ON FAITH   AND THE CONCEPT OF FREEDOM.  AND WE ARE LOSING THOSE FREEDOMS  SLOWLY BUT SURELY IN THIS COUNTRY.  AND THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO   KEEP THEM IS FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU  TO BE INVOLVED, AND TO MAKE SURE  THAT YOU HOLD PEOPLE RUNNING FOR OFFICE TO ACCOUNT TO MAINTAIN   OUR FREEDOM AND TO MAKE SURE   THAT OUR FAITH IS NOT PUSHED ASIDE.  I DON'T KNOW WHO HOW MANY OF YOU EVER GET A CHANCE TO GO DOWN AND  SEE THE CONGRESS IN SESSION, BUT  WE BEGIN EVERY DAY WITH A PRAYER  AND THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE.  AND EVERY REPUBLICAN MEETING   THAT WE HAVE, OUR CONFERENCE   MEETINGS, NOT ALL THE COMMITTEE   MEETINGS, BUT A LOT OF OUR SPECIAL COMMITTEE MEETINGS, WE   BEGIN WITH A PRAYER.  AND THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE. AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT YOU KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE DO LOOK TO GOD FOR GUIDANCE. AND I WILL TELL YOU, SOME OF THE PRAYERS GIVEN IN OUR CONFERENCE   ARE SO INSPIRING, I'VE BEEN COLLECTING THEM.  AND I HOPE SOME DAY TO BE ABLE   TO PUBLISH THOSE.  I WANT TO TELL YOU, YOU HAVE   FOLKS ON OUR SIDE OF THE AISLE   AND SOME PEOPLE ON THE OTHER   SIDE OF THE AISLE WHO WANT TO   SUSTAIN WHAT FOUNDED OUR COUNTRY.  AND THIS MORNING I SAID TO ONE OF MY STAFFERS, BEFORE I CAME,   YOU KNOW, I SAID, I WANT TO TALK  JUST A BIT ABOUT THE FOUNDING OF THE COUNTRY AND THIS THEME OF   FAITH AND FREEDOM.  AND I SAID, BECAUSE I KNOW I'VE   READ THAT THE FOUNDER, THE   SIGNERS OF THE CONSTITUTION, THE SIGNERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WERE MEMBERS OF THE  AMERICAN BIBLE SOCIETY, MOST OF THEM WERE PREACHERS, MOST OF YOU  PROBABLY KNOW THAT HISTORY.  IF YOU DON'T, I ENCOURAGE YOU   TO -- TO GO TO WALL BUILDERS AND LEARN MORE ABOUT IT.  BUT I FOUND SOMETHING REALLY INTERESTING, MY STAFF GAVE ME   THE LIST OF PRESIDENTS OF THE   AMERICAN BIBLE SOCIETY, AND I   SEE THAT UNITED STATES SENATOR THEODORE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN BIBLE SOCIETY IN  1846. AND THEN FREDERICK THEODORE WAS   ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE   AMERICAN BIBLE SOCIETY 1894.  THE REASON I MENTION THE FREELINGHISEN IS BECAUSE THERE SAY FREELINGHISEN IN THE   CONGRESS RIGHT NOW FROM NEW   JERSEY.  THAT THREAD STAYED WITH US THROUGHOUT OUR ENTIRE HISTORY.  AND WE WANT TO KEEP THAT THREAD   THERE. I WILL TELL YOU THAT, AGAIN, YOU HEAR LOTS OF NEGATIVE THINGS   ABOUT US, BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS SOME REALLY POSITIVE THINGS THAT HAPPEN.  WE HAVE A PRAYER BREAKFAST EVERY  THURSDAY MORNING OUT OF WHICH THE NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST DEVELOPED. AND WE PRAY FOR EACH OTHER AND   WE PRAY FOR OUR LEADERS.  I GO TO A BIBLE STUDY ON WEDNESDAY MORNINGS. AND MY GROUP FOCUSES ON  CALL ING CALLING.  IT IS SO GREAT, ONE OF THE BEST   DEVOTIONALS THAT WE HAVE.  I WANT TO TALK ABOUT POLICY.  AS SOME OF YOU KNOWN AND OTHER PEOPLE WILL ALLUDE TO TODAY,   SPEAKER RYAN ASKED US TO LOOK AT  SETTING UP AN AGENDA CALLED   BETTER WAY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  WE WANT TO POINT OUT WE HAVE A PHILOSOPHY AND AGENDA THAT IF WE  ARE RETURNED TO CONGRESS WITH A   REPUBLICAN MAJORITY AND GET A   REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, THEN WE   WILL HAVE A BETTER WAY FOR THE   AMERICAN PEOPLE.  WE BELIEVE WE WILL WIN ON PHILOSOPHY AND IDEAS.  WE DON'T WANT THIS CONTEST THIS   FALL TO BE A CONTEST OF JUST PERSONALITIES. SO WE ARE WORKING ON THAT AND WE  RULED AT THE FIRST ONE ON POVERTY, OPPORTUNITY AND   EDUCATION. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT OUR   FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE   ALWAYS BEEN SO GOOD AT.  AND WE WANT TO GIVE THEM EVEN MORE OF AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE FUTURE.  DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES BETTER THAN THE   PRIVATE OR NONPROFIT SECTOR? NOTHING.  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. AND WE HAVE BEEN SPENDING A   TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON POVERTY PROGRAMS AND HAVEN'T MOVED THE NEEDLE ONE BIT.  AND SO WE WANT TO RE-ENGAGE THE   FAITH COMMUNITY IN WORKING WITH   US TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  GO BACK TO THE WAY IT USED TO BE  IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE THAT WAS   THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS.  YOU KNOW, I AM SOMEBODY WHO   BEGINS EACH DAY AS I SAID READING JESUS' CALLING.  SOMETIMES I READ IT AT MIDNIGHT BEFORE I GO TO BED AND READ IT   AGAIN IN THE MORNING.  BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT MOST  OF US, STARTING WITH THE SPEAKER, AND COMING DOWN AND   I -- TO ALL OF US, ON OUR SIDE   OF THE AISLE, THAT WE KNOW THAT THIS NATION NEEDS A MORAL AND SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION IN ORDER TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE.  GEORGE WASHINGTON SAID IN HIS FIRST INAUGURAL, NO PEOPLE CAN BE BOUND TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND ADORE THE INVISIBLE HAND WHICH CONDUCTS THE AFFAIRS OF MEN MORE THAN THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.  SO WE MUST BE INVOLVED AS PEOPLE  OF FAITH.  AND I OFTEN TALK TO PEOPLE AT   HOME WHO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE   LOSING THEIR FAITH, AND THEY   SAY, OH, WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING, WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING, IT IS ALL   LOST. PLEASE DON'T BUY INTO THAT.  DO NOT BUY INTO THAT.  I BELIEVE AS LONG AS GOD GIVES US BREATH WE HAVE HOPE, AND WE   CAN SAVE THIS COUNTRY. AND WHEN I -- WHAT I'VE TOLD PEOPLE FROM MANY, MANY YEARS   WHEN THEY TOLD ME YEARS AGO WHEN  I FIRST RAN FOR THE STATE SENATE, I WAS AT A CHURCH MEETING PEOPLE, AND THEY SAID,   WE DON'T THINK CHURCH AND   POLITICS SHOULD MIX.  POLITICS IS A DIRTY BUSINESS.  AND I SAID, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, IF PEOPLE OF FAITH   ARE NOT INVOLVED IN POLITICAL LIFE, THEN YOU'RE LEAVING IT TO THE PHILISTINES. AND I'M NOT WILLING TO LEAVE IT TO THE PHILISTINES.  I WANT TO SAY TO YOU, THANK YOU,  THANK YOU FOR BEING INVOLVED   WITH THE FAITH AND FREEDOM COALITION.  THANK YOU FOR CARING ABOUT THIS COUNTRY. THANK YOU FOR BEING PEOPLE OF FAITH.  AND DON'T BE DISCOURAGED.  I'M NOT DISCOURAGED. YOU SHOULDN'T BE DISCOURAGED.  YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT OF   OTHER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO   ARE GOING TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO  THE SAME THING. THIS IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN   THE WORLD.  HELP US KEEP IT THAT WAY.  GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. >  >>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- LADIES -- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,   PLEASE WELCOME FROM THE GREAT   STATE OF GEORGIA, CONGRESSMAN   JODY HISE.  >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  WHAT A TREMENDOUS HONOR TO BE HERE.  I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND MOST OF   ALL THANK YOU FOR BEING A PART   OF THIS AND FAITH AND FREEDOM COALITION, WHAT AN OUTSTANDING   JOB YOU'RE DOING.  FOR SOME OF YOU WHO MAY NOT KNOW, MY BACKGROUND IS ACTUALLY IN MINISTRY.  I WAS A PASTOR FOR 25 OR 30   YEARS, CONSERVATIVE RADIO TALK   SHOW HOST AS WELL. AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A   COUPLE OF BITS OF GOOD NEWS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I THINK ALL OF US HERE FROM WASHINGTON, A LOT OF DISCOURAGEMENT, NOT   NECESSARILY FROM WASHINGTON REPRESENTATIVES, BUT WHAT WE ALL  JUST FEEL.  WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY, WE'RE WATCHING THE   DEMISE OF OUR COUNTRY RIGHT   BEFORE OUR EYES.  AND WE'RE DISTURBED, WE'RE   BROKEN, BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU A  LITTLE BIT OF GOOD NEWS AND WANT TO CIRCLE BACK AROUND AND GIVE YOU OTHER POINTS OF PERSPECTIVE   IN ALL OF THIS.  ONE OF THE COMMITTEES I SERVE ON  IS OGR, OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM.  THAT IS THE COMMITTEE THAT I'VE   COME TO REFER TO AS THE GROUP   THAT DEALS WITH THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT, WHICH   TODAY ARE WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE.  THAT'S WHAT OGR DEALS WITH.  WHENEVER THERE IS INEFFICIENCY,   WASTE, SCANDAL, IT COMES UNDER   THE JURISDICTION OF OUR COMMITTEE.  THIS PAST YEAR WE HAVE ACTUALLY CALLED FOR THE REMOVAL OF OFFICE  FROM OGR, REMOVAL FROM OFFICE FROM VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES SOMEWHERE IN THE BALLPARK OF 20 DIFFERENT HEADS   OF DEPARTMENTS.  WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN REMOVING 18 OUT OF 20.  AND THAT'S NOT THE TYPE OF THING  YOU HEAR ABOUT IN THE NEWS.  I WISH IT -- I WISH THAT TYPE OF  INFORMATION WE GET OUT MORE, BUT  THAT'S GOOD NEWS.  NOW, ONE OF THE TWO WE HAVE NOT   BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN IS A GUY NAMED JOHN COSKINEN, HEAD OF THE  IRS.  REMEMBER THE E-MAIL SCANDALS AND THE TARGETING OF THE IRS ON   CONSERVATIVES AND CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATIONS ABSOLUTELY INEXCUSABLE, HAD HEARINGS, WE ASKED HIM TO STEP DOWN FROM HIS POSITION. HE REFUSED TO DO SO.  WE SENT A LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT ASKING HIM TO REMOVE KOSKINEN, HE REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  SO WE WENT THE NEXT STEP AND   THAT IS WE FILED ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST JOHN KOSKINEN.  AND IT'S TAKEN SEVERAL MOMS, BUT  A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ACTUALLY TOOK UP HEARINGS ON THAT.  WE ARE GOING TO STAY ON HIS CASE  UNTIL HE FINDS SOMETHING ELSE TO  DO OR HAS A CLEAN SELL HE CAN   SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN. I'M ALSO HONORED TO BE PART OF A  GROUP OF EVANGELICALS IN CONGRESS REACHING OUT TO THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY CROSS AMERICA.  WE HAD OUR FIRST MEETING WITH MANY LEADING PASTORS FROM ACROSS  THE COUNTRY. WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE GOT   TO HAVE PEOPLE OF FAITH, WE HAVE  GOT TO HAVE CHRISTIAN LEADERS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ENGAGE WITH US IN PRAYER AND IN JUST   IMPACTING OUR CULTURE.  AND SO WE HAVE A FANTASTIC   MEETING ABOUT A MONTH OR SO AGO,  WE HAVE GOT A CONFERENCE CALL WITH A GROUP OF PASTORS THAT   WILL TAKE PLACE AGAIN NEXT WEEK.  AND WE'RE TRYING TO EXPAND THAT.  WE UNDERSTAND THE TREMENDOUS   NEED. ANOTHER HUGE THING THAT RIGHT   NOW WE'RE ENGAGED IN IS FADA,   FIRST AMENDMENT DEFENSE ACT.  I DON'T HAVE TO TELL ANYONE IN   HERE THAT THE RISE OF PERSECUTION AND HARASSMENT IS MASSIVELY ON THE INCREASE IN THE  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND WE HAVE GOT TO DEFEND OUR RIGHTS TO  KEEP THE DOORS OF THE GOSPEL   OPEN AND TO KEEP THE RIGHTS OF   CONSCIENCE FOR EVERY BELIEVER AND EVERY CHRISTIAN AND EVERY   CITIZEN INTO THIS COUNTRY, TO   LIVE ACCORDING TO THEIR BELIEFS AND TO DO SO WITHOUT FEAR OF INTIMIDATION OR HARASSMENT OR   PUNISHMENT FROM OUR GOVERNMENT.  SO WE ARE WORKING HARD TO PUSH   THE FIRST AMENDMENT DEFENSE ACT   THROUGH.  NOW, A COUPLE OF THINGS, LET ME   CIRCLE AROUND IN OUR CLOSING FEW  MOMENTS THAT WE HAVE, I DON'T   KNOW HOW ELSE TO SAY IT, BUT WE'RE IN THE FIGHT OF OUR LIFE   FOR OUR COUNTRY. ABSOLUTELY THE FIGHT OF OUR   LIFE.  AND AT THE CORE OF THAT BATTLE IS THE SPIRITUAL NEED AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE AND WE CONTINUE TO FORSAKE THE JUDEO-CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES UPON   WHICH THIS NATION WAS ESTABLISHED, THE PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE SEPARATED THIS COUNTRY FROM  EVERY OTHER NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THAT IS THE CORE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING. AND SPIRITUAL PROBLEMS CANNOT BE  OR POLITICAL PROWESS.  AND WE ARE FIRMLY AWARE OF THAT.  FRIENDS, ABSOLUTELY THE GREATEST NEED WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY IS   A SPIRITUAL AWAKENING, AND WE NEED YOU.  I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING A   PART OF THIS.  AS I MENTIONED A FEW MOMENTS AGO, MY BACKGROUND IS IN   MINISTRY, BEEN A PASTOR FOR MANY YEARS, CONSERVATIVE RADIO TALK   SHOW HOST FOR AN 12, AND THE REDEFINING MOMENT, THERE HAVE   BEEN SEVERAL, BUT ONE OF THE   REDEFINING MOMENTS IN MY LIFE CAME WHEN THE ACLU CAME AFTER   THE CHURCH I WAS PASTORING.  THAT LAWSUIT LITERALLY MARCHED RIGHT INSIDE THE DOORS OF OUR CHURCH NAP CHURCH.  THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE A TURNING POINT IN MY LIFE. I STEPPED UP THERE. LATER ON, CENSORING WHAT CAN AND CANNOT BE SAID IN PULPITS ACROSS  AMERICA. WE CONTINUE THAT BATTLE TODAY. THE POINT OF SAYING ALL THAT IS   TO SAY THIS. Y'ALL, THIS IS OUR COUNTRY.  THIS IS ""OUR"" TURF, AND THE   REALITY HIT ME ONE DAY THAT IT IS WE THE PEOPLE. DO YOU REALIZE AS CHRISTIANS WE   HAVE TWO MANDATES TO ENGAGE OUR   CULTURE AND TO MAKE A   DIFFERENCE. WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE PASSAGES LIKE   MATTHEW 5 THAT CALM US TO BE SALT AND LIGHT IN OUR WORLD,   REGARDLESS OF THE COUNTRY WE   LIVE IN.  WE ARE CALLED TO BE SALT AND LIGHT, REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE LIVE.  BUT HERE IN AMERICA, WE HAVE   SOMETHING ELSE.  WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT THAT DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT INVOLVEMENT FROM THE PEOPLE.  AND SO WE HAVE BOTH A BIBLICAL   MANDATE AND THE HONOR OF LIVING   IN A COUNTRY THAT DOESN'T WORK   UNLESS WE STEP UP TO THE PLATE   AND ENGAGE THIS THING HEAD-ON.  AND WHEN THAT REALITY HIT ME, I   REALIZED THAT I CAN'T JUST COMPLAIN. I CAN'T JUST DO THE THINGS THAT   I WAS DOING AT THAT POINT.  THERE IS A DEEP, A VERY DEEP SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY IN DUTY   TO STEP UP AND AFTER MUCH PRAYER MY WIFE AND I FELT LIKE THIS IS   WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO AND GOD LED  THE WAY.  NOW, NONE OF US CAN DO IT ALL. ALL OF US ARE NOT CALLED TO BE   PART OF PUBLIC OFFICE, BUT ALL OF US CAN DO SOMETHING, AND YOU   ARE RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDST OF   IT, AND FROM THE DEPTHS OF MY   HEART I SAY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT.  IN OUR CULTURE.  LET ME CLOSE WITH THIS QUOTE -- ONE OF MY GREAT HEROES IS JAMES GARFIELD.  DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW MUCH ABOUT GARFIELD. HE'S THE ONLY MINISTER EVER TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.  AND UNFORTUNATELY, HE WAS ASSASSINATED.  I DON'T KNOW IF THAT HAS   ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT BUT GARFIELD  GARFIELD, I'VE NEVER READ   ANYTHING FROM HIM I DIDN'T   DEEPLY WALK AWAY FROM SAYING HE   GOT IT.  HE UNDERSTANDS. HE UNDERSTOOD THE ISSUES OF   FAITH AND FREEDOM. HE UNDERSTOOD THE ROLE OF RELIGION AND MORALITY, AS OUR FOUNDERS' DESCRIBED IT, AND GARFIELD MADE THIS QUOTE -- AND I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THIS, BECAUSE TELL ME IF IT DOESN'T APPLY MORE TODAY THAN   IT'S EVER APPLIED IN ANY OF OUR   LIFE TIMES.  HE SAID THIS -- NOW MORE THAN EVER BEFORE THE   PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE   CHARACTER OF THEIR CONGRESS. IF THAT BODY -- IF THAT BODY BE IGNORANT, RECKLESS AND CORRUPT   IT IS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE TOLERATE IGNORANCE, RECKLESSNESS AND CORRUPTION.  HE WENT ON AND SAID -- IF THAT BODY BE INTELLIGENT, BRAVE AND PURE, IT'S BECAUSE THE  PEOPLE DEMAND THESE QUALITIES TO  REPRESENT THEM IN THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE.  THEN HE SAID THIS -- IF THE NEXT CENTENNIAL DOES NOT FIND US A GREAT NATION, IT WILL BE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO   REPRESENT THE ENTERPRISE, THE   CULTURE AND THE MORALITY OF THE NATION DID NOT AID IN CONTROLLING THE POLITICAL FORCES.  FOLKS, THIS IS OUR TURF.  IT'S OUR COUNTRY.  IT'S OUR TIME FOR THE BODY OF   CHRIST TO HAVE HER FINEST HOUR.  THIS IS THE TIME TO STEP UP TO   THE PLATE. THE STAKES ARE ENORMOUSLY HIGH,   AS YOU WELL KNOW. THIS IS A TIME.  I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING   ENGAGED. GOD BLESS YOU.  KEEP THE TORCH ABLAZE.  >  >>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE  HELP ME WELCOME TO THE STAGE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE FAITH AND FREEDOM COALITION, DAVE BAKER.    >> SENATOR DAVID PURDUE IS AN   OUTSIDER AND BUSINESSMAN WITH   OVER 40 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE INCLUDING SERVING AS A CEO OF REEBOK AND DOLLAR GENERAL.  DAVID HAD NEVER RUN FOR POLITICAL OFFICE UNTIL 2014 WHEN  HE AND HIS WIFE BONNIE WERE   INSPIRED TO GET INVOLVED AND   HELP CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF OUR COUNTRY.  IN THE SENATE, HE HAS MADE HIS   MARK ON THE BUDGET, FOREIGN RELATIONS, AGRICULTURE AND JUDICIARY COMMITTEES. DAVID IS SPOTTING FOR GEORGIANS   AND ALL OF US EVERY DAY IN THE U.S. SENATE, AND IS COMMITTED TO  SOLVING OUR NATIONAL DEBT AND GLOBAL SECURITY CRISIS.  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SENATOR   DAVID PURDUE OF GEORGIA.    >> GOOD MORNING. I THINK WE HAVE A FEW GEORGIA   FOLKS OUT HERE.  DON'T WE?   ALL RIGHT.  I AM SO HONORED TO BE HERE. YOU KNOW, WE DO HAVE A SERIOUS MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY, AS YOU   HEARD FROM THE PRIOR SPEAKER,   AND I JUST HATE HAVING TO FOLLOW  THESE PREACHERS.  THEY HAVE ALL THE ANECDOTE,   JODYS A GREAT GUY, ANOTHER   GEORGIA BOY, BUT THANK YOU FOR   BEING HERE.  I THINK WE ARE CALLED TO PRAY. I THINK WE'RE PRAYED TO CALL FOR OUR COUNTRY, FOR OUR LEADERS   AND, YES, EVE BE OUR PRESIDENT. IN HIS ROLE AS PRESIDENT WE   SHOULD PRAY FOR BARACK OBAMA BUT WE NEED TO BE VERY SPECIFIC HOW WE PRAY.  PRAY LIKE PSALMS 109: 8 SAYS. IT SAYS, LET HIS DAYS BE FEW. AND LET ANOTHER HAVE HIS OFFICE. IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, I BELIEVE THAT AMERICA IS AT A MOMENT OF CRISIS.  I SEE THREE DIMENSIONS IN THAT CRISIS.  FIRST, WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS.  NOT MY WORDS. THE WORDS OF JONATHAN TURLEY. A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROFESSOR AT  GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY   RIGHT HERE IN TOWN.  THIS PRESIDENT HAS FIGURED OUT   HOW TO RUN THE COUNTRY WITHOUT   CONGRESS THROUGH EXECUTIVE   ORDERS AND REGULATORY MANDATE. HE'S ACTUALLY CREATED A FOURTH ARMORED GOVERNMENT, THE   REGULATORS. AND THOSE REGULATORS JUST IN THE  LAST SEVEN YEARS HAVE CREATED 20,000, OVER 20,000, NEW   REGULATIONS, AND IT'S SUCKING   THE VERY LIFE OUT OF OUR FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM.  THE SECOND DIMENSION OF OUR   CRISIS, I BELIEVE, IS A GLOBAL   SECURITY CRISIS.  I BELIEVE THE WORLD IS MORE DANGEROUS RIGHT NOW THAN ANY POINT IN MY LIFETIME.  I'M A MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE. I TRAVEL A GOOD BIT AS A PART OF  THAT RESPONSIBILITY, AND I CAN   TELL YOU, WHEN YOU MEET WITH   THESE LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD,   YOU CAN SEE THE FEAR IN THEIR EYES, BECAUSE WE ARE NOT LEADING  ANY LONGER, AND THEY'RE WORRIED   ABOUT THEIR FREEDOM AND THEIR FUTURE. THE WORLD IS VERY DANGEROUS.  WE SEE IT ON MANY LEVELS.  FIRST, THE RISE OF RUSSIA, AND CHINA, AND THEIR EVER-GROWING AGGRESSIVENESS.  WE SEE THE EXPANSION OF ISIS AROUND THE WORLD NOW.  WE SEE THE NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION DANGER AMONG ROGUE NATIONS LIKE   NORTH KOREA AND IRAN. AND, YES, WE SEE HYBRID WARFARE PERPETRATED IT TODAY, INCLUDING CYBER WARFARE AND OTHER MEANS.  AND THE LAST THING, WHAT NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT IS WE   RIGHT NOW HAVE AN ARMS RACE IN   SPACE.  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, RIGHT NOW THE WORLD IS A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE, YET AT THIS POINT IN OUR HISTORY, THIS PRESIDENT JUST   LIKE THE LAST TWO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS HAS DISINVESTED IN   OUR MILITARY.  TO A POINT WE'RE SPURNEDING ABOUT SPENDING THE LOWEST SINCE WORLD   WAR 2. $200 BILLION LESS THAN OUR 30-YEAR AVERAGE. THIS LEGACY OF OUR PRESIDENT   WILL BE HE'S LEAVING US IN THE WEAKEST POSITION MILITARILY AT A TIME WE'RE FACING MORE THREATS   AROUND THE WORLD THAN WE EVER   HAVE.  TODAY WE HAVE THE SMALLEST ARMY SINCE WORLD WAR II, THE SMALLEST  NAVY SINCE WORLD WAR I. THE OLDEST AND SMALLEST AIR   FORCE EVER.  I'VE BEEN AROUND THE WORLD   VISITING THESE MEN AND WOMEN.  I CAN TELL YOU THE BEST, I MEAN   THE VERY BEST OF AMERICA IS IN   UNIFORM FIGHTING FOR YOU AND ME AND DEFENDING OUR NATION RIGHT NOW.  THE THIRD DIMENSION OF THIS CRISIS IS INTERLOCKED WITH THE   GLOBAL SECURITY CRISIS, BECAUSE   OUR DEBT CRISIS IS PREVENTING US  FROM REANTICIPATIZING OUR MILITARY TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN   DEFEND OUR COUNTRY.  WE ALL KNOW THE HEADLINES. $19 TRILLION OF DEBT, BUT IT   GETS WORSE. THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET SERVICE SAYS IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING IN  THE NEXT 30 YEARS THAT DEBT GOES TO $30 TRILLION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TODAY IF   INTEREST RATES WERE JUST AT   THEIR 30-YEAR AVERAGE OF 5%, HOW MANY OF YOU REMEMBER DOUBLE DIGIT INFLATION? YEAH.  I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK THERE   AND YOU DON'T EITHER, BUT IF IT   JUST WENT TO THE 5% WE'D BE   PAYING OVER $1 TRILLION.  IN INTEREST. TODAY THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE ON A  $4 TRILLION BUDGET.  WORSE THAN THAT, IN THE NEXT 30   YEARS ALONE, FUTURE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE  $1 MILLION FOR EVERY FAMILY IN AMERICA.  THIS IS INTRANSIGENCE ON A MAJOR  SCALE.  BOTH PARTIES OF GUILTY, BY THE   WAY.  WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.  BUT, YOU KNOW, WHENEVER AMERICA   HAS BEEN IN A MOMENT OF CRISIS   WE'VE WORKED AND WORKED AND WITH  GOD'S DIRECTION HAVE FOUND A   MOMENT OF OPPORTUNITY.  THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TODAY.  I THINK THE MOMENT OF OPPORTUNITY IS GREATER THAN THE   MOMENT OF CRISIS.  WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO   CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF OUR COUNTRY, AND SET UP THE NEXT 50 YEARS TO 100 YEARS FOR OUR   CHILDREN, AND OUR CHILDREN'S   CHILDREN THAT WOULD MAKE THE   LAST SEVEN YEARS OF ECONOMIC   BOOM, GREATEST IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND, PALE IN COMPARISON. BUT WE HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT  DOING SOMETHING. FIRST, I THINK WHEN MY WIFE AND   I DECIDED TO RUN, I'D NEVER DONE  ANYTHING IN POLITICS. MY MOM AND DAD WERE SCHOOLTEACHERS. MY MOM'S 90, THINKS I'D LOST MY   MIND WHEN WE DECIDED TO RUN FOR THE SENATE. GOT SO BAD HALF WAY THROUGH THE RACE.  DEMOCRATS IN HERE PILING ON US.  I WAS A NOMINEE AND MY MOTHER   WAS VERY INVOLVED. CALLED ME ONE DAY SIX WEEKS OUT FROM THE ELECTION.  DAVID, I LOVE YOU LIKE A SON.  I AM YOUR SON.  YEAH, BUT IF THESE DEMOCRATS KEEP UP I MIGHT NOT EVEN VOTE   FOR YOU. THIS IS ALL NEW TO ME, BUT MY   WIFE ARE AND I DECIDED THEN THAT WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO TRY AND IN SOME SMALL WAY TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY, AND WE SAW THEN THERE WERE THREE  THINGS THAT HAD TO HAPPEN, IN   OUR OPINION.  ONE, TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY WE HAD TO WIN THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN 2016 --   OR IN '14, AND WE DID, WITH YOUR HELP.  THEN WE SAID, WELL, WE NEED TO MAINTAIN THAT MAJORITY IN '16, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE WAY   THIS COUNTRY IS BEING LED NOW WE  HAD TO PUT SOMEONE IN THE WHITE   HOUSE WHO WAS CONSERVATIVE AND   UNDERSTOOD WE NEED TO CHANGE THE  DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY. THOSE ARE THE THREE THINGS WE HAD TO DO.  TODAY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION   YEAR. WE'RE DOWN TO TWO CANDIDATES. I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF   THE COUNTRY YOU DON'T WANT A THIRD TERM OF BARACK OBAMA.  YOU HAVE TO PUT ASIDE OUR DIFFERENCES AND PUT DONALD J.   TRUMP IN OUR WHITE HOUSE.  WITH TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE LEADERSHIP AROUND HIM, I  BELIEVE WE CAN FINALLY BRING TERM LIMITS TO THE UNITED STATES  SENATE AND THE UNITED STATES   HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. I BELIEVE WE CAN ACTUALLY- --   -- I BELIEVE WE CAN ACTUALLY   BEGIN TO CORRECT THE BUDGET PROCESS THAT'S BEEN BROKEN FOR   THE LAST 42 YEARS.  IT'S ONLY WORKED FOUR TIMES, FOLKS.  IMAGINE THAT?  THAT'S THE ROOT OF WHAT THIS   PROBLEM IS ALL ABOUT.  I BELIEVE WE CAN ELIMINATE REDUNDANT AGENCIES SOME $300 BILLION, $400 BILLION, AND YES,   GROW THE ECONOMY.  THE IRONY OF ALL OF THESE SWEEPING PROGRAMS THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE PUT ON US.  YOU THINK, HOW DID WE GET HERE?  THE IRONY IS, THEY HAVE FAILED.  WE HAVE IN THE LAST 100 YEARS THREE SUPER MAJORITIES.  FIRST GAVE US THE NEW DEAL.  SECOND, A GREAT SOCIETY. THE THIRD, OBAMA CARE AND   DODD-FRANK. I'M A BUSINESS GUY BUT THOSE   THREE SUPER MAJORITIES MOST OF   THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS   FINANCIAL KA AS ITTRY WE HAVE NOW, THE IRONY IS, THOSE SWEEPING PROGRESSIVE PROGRAMS HAVE FAILED THE VERY PEOPLE THEY  CLAIMED TO CHAMPION.  THE WORKING MIDDLE CLASS AND THE WORKING POOR. THEY FAIL.  TODAY WE HAVE THE WEAKEST   ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN THE LAST 70 YEARS UNDERWAY. IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS ALONE WE'VE NOT HAD ONE QUARTER OF 3%   GDP GROWTH.  WE -- IF YOU LOOK AT THE WORKFORCE, WE HAVE RIGHT NOW, WE  HAVE THE SMALLEST WORKFORCE   PARTICIPATION RATE SINCE JIMMY   CARTER WAS PRESIDENT, AND WORST   OF ALL, FOLKS, IN THE LAST SEVEN  YEARS UNDER THIS PRESIDENT WE'VE ALLOWED 4 MILLION WOMEN TO FALL   INTO POVERTY. IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE FAILED. WE KNOW THAT.  THE EVIDENCE IS THERE.  NOW WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY.  IF WE GET SERIOUS AND PUT OUR DIFFERENCES ASIDE WE CAN CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE CAN FIX THESE THINGS, SAVE SOCIAL KURT Y SECURITY, ARREST THE RISING   NATURE OF OUR HEALTH CARE COSTS AND PUT THIS COUNTRY IN A DIRECTION FOR OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN TO WHERE WE   SWROENT TO LOOK AT THEM AND   APOLOGIZE. YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND THINGS WE'VE GOT TO DO IS GET BACK TO OUR FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OR OUR FOUNDING MOTHERS AND OUR FOUNDING FATHERS, ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY.  FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. LIMITED GOVERNMENT.  INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY.  I THINK WE'RE CALLED TO PRAY. 2 CHRONICLES SAYS, IF MY PEOPLE,  WHO ARE CALLED BY MY NAME WILL   HUMBLE THEMSELVES AND PRAY AND   SEEK MY FACE AND TURN FROM THEIR  WICKED WAYS, I WILL HEAR THEM IN HEAVEN FORGIVE THEIR SINS AND   HEAL THEIR LAND.  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE NEED THAT PRAYER TODAY.  WE NEED TO HEAL OUR LAND. WE NEED TO TURN BACK AND TURN   AWAY FROM THE DIRECTION WE'VE   BEEN HEADED. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE  DIRECTION OF OUR COUNTRY.  I BELIEVE THAT JOHN ADAMS HAD IT  RIGHT. THAT ONCE A CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT TURNS AWAY FROM   FREEDOM IT CAN NEVER BE RESTORED.  LIBERTY ONCE LOST IS LOST FOREVER.  I DON'T WANT TO BE A MEMBER OF   THE FIRST GENERATION IN AMERICAN  HISTORY THAT HAS TO TELL MY CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN THAT I'M LEAVING THEM IN A WORLD   WORSE OFF AND LESS FREE THAN THE  ONE MY PARENTS LEFT ME.  IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY.  WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO   CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF OUR   COUNTRY AND THANK YOU FOR BEING INVOLVED. IF WE PUT DONALD J. TRUMP IN OUR  WHITE HOUSE WE CAN CHANGE THE   DIRECTION OF OUR WHITE HOUSE,   BECAUSE WE CANNOT ALLOW HILLARY   RODHAM CLINTON ONE MORE NIGHT   OUR WHITE HOUSE!  THANK YOU, GOD BLESS YOU.   >> WHO ARE THESE DEMOCRATS?    >> SENTENCED ON TUESDAY TO SPEND EIGHT MONTHS IN A CONFINEMENT   CENTER.  >> IT ALL BEGAN WITH THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO SHUT ME UP.  >> ALL ABOUT STEALING, MAN.  >> WHAT DID I LEARN?

GLAD TO HAVE A CHANCE TO VISIT WITH YOU A LITTLE WHILE.  TELL YOU MY STORY AND ADJUST TO   MY VOICE. WHEN I FIRST MEET PEOPLE WHAT I   HEAR THE MOST IS, THAT THE NOT WHAT I EXPECTED TO COME OUT.  I GET THAT.  WELCOME TO MY LIFE FROM THERE.  I SERVED IN THE UNITED STATES   SENATE THE LAST TWO YEARS.  DAVID PERDUE, JUST HERE BEFORE, HE AND I CAME INTO THE SENATE AT  THE SAME TIME AND BY THE WAY HE'S A SOLID CHRISTIAN LEADER AND IS DOING A VERY GOOD JOB   HERE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE.  I COME FROM A LITTLE DIFFERENT BACKGROUND, THOUGH.  I'VE SERVED 22 YEARS IN YOUTH   MINISTRY BEFORE I CAME INTO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS.  THAT MIGHT THINK LIKE AN ODD DIRECTION, BUT FRANKLY MY   PREPARATION OF WORKING WITH JUVENILES WAS VERY GOOD   PREPARATION TO COME TO CONGRESS. FOR MY WIFE AND I, THIS IS WHAT SHE CALLS LIFE'S GREATEST INTERRUPTION. WE NEVER PLANNED TO GO TO CONGRESS.  THIS WAS A SENSE OF CALLING FOR US. AND WE REALLY FELT THAT GOD INTERRUPTED OUR LIFE AND SAID   THIS IS WHAT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO  DO, AND WHEN GOD CALLED US TO DO  THAT WE SPENT SEVEN MONTHS   PRAYING AND STRUGGLING THROUGH THAT COMING TO THE POINT I'M GOING TO BE AN OLD MAN TELLING THEM I DIDN'T FOLLOW GOD IF I   DON'T DO THIS. I RESIGNED MY POSITION, STARTED TO RUN FOR GOVERNMENT, OBVIOUSLY  ELECTED AND TRY TO TAKE OFF INTO  THIS TASK TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT  THING THE RIGHT WAY AND ENGAGE   THE IN ADDITION IN THOSE CRITICAL THINGS. PEOPLE INITIALLY TOLD ME YOU'RE LEAVING YOUR CALLING, BECAUSE   YOU'RE GETTING INVOLVED IN GOVERNMENT.  THAT'S NOT WHERE GOD WORKS. I ALWAYS SMILED AT THEM, SAID, TELL YOU WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.  GO TO THE OLD TESTAMENT OF THE   39 BOOKS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT TRY TO FIND A BOOK THAT WASN'T WRIT TON A POLITICAL LEADER BY A  POLITICAL LEADER OR ABOUT A POLITICAL LEADER. TO, ABOUT, OR BY.  NOW, FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE   GOING TO GET BORED IN MY SPEECH,  PROBABLY WILL HAPPEN QUICKLY,   YOU CAN START THINKING ABOUT   THAT. I THINK THERE ARE 37 OF THE 39 BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT THAT   MEET THAT CATEGORY.  IF YOU LOOK AT EVEN THE CALLING   OF SAUL WHEN HE BECAME PAUL,   STRUCK BLIND ON THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS, ANNANIUS COMPLAINED,   YOU REALLY WANT ME TO SO THIS GUY?  THE SPIRIT OF GOD SAID, YES, HE IS MY CHOSEN INSTRUMENT TO THE JEWS, GENTILES AND GENTILE   KINGS. PAUL REACHED OUT TO ALL INCOME GROUPS INCLUDING GOVERNMENT LEADERS.  DOES GOD HAVE A HEART FOR THE NATION THROUGH GOVERNMENT? ABSOLUTELY HE DOES.  HE'S THE CREATOR OF GOVERNMENT LIKE HE'S THE CREATOR OF THE FAMILY LIKE HE'S THE CREATOR OF WORK.  SO WE CANNOT WRITE OFF WHAT HE   HAS NOT WRITTEN OFF.  AND WE SHOULD ENGAGE IN THOSE AREAS, BUT WE HAVE A BAD HABIT   AS AMERICANS TO MAKE OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS INTO CELEBRITIES.  ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE NOT CELEBRITIES.  THEY ARE ASKED TO DO A JOB.  AND BY THE WAY, THIS IS A REAL JOB.  AND IT HAS REAL WORK. IT'S SLOW. IT'S TEDIOUS AND COMMON SENSE   THINGS TAKE FOREVER, AND I'VE   HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN, YOU   KNOW, BIG SHIPS DON'T TURN QUICKLY.  AND I'LL RESPOND, BUT THEY DO TURN.  YOU HAVE TO START BY TURNING THE WHEEL AND EVENTUALLY THEY WILL   TURN.  WE TURNED INTO THE STORM THAT WE'RE IN AS A NATION RIGHT NOW.  BECAUSE PRIOR CONGRESS' AND   LEADERSHIP INCLUDING SOME   CURRENT LEADERSHIP HAVE TURNED   US INTO THAT STORM.  WE CAN TURN OUR WAY BACK OUT.  THE CHALLENGE IS EXACTLY, HOW DO WE DO THAT? AND HOW CAN WE GET THAT DONE? I WILL TELL YOU OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND WHAT'S   HAPPENED IN THE SENATE AND HOUSE HAS BEEN REMARKABLE TO SEE FOP   ANSWER HILLARY CLINTON'S   FAVORITE QUESTION, WHAT   DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?  A FEW THOUGHTS JUST FOR THE SNT   ON WHAT DIFFERENCE IT MAKES.  WE'RE ACTUALLY VOTING AGAIN AND   THAT MAY SEEM LIKE A TRIVIAL THING PUP DON'T MOVE ON ISSUES   UNLESS YOU VOTE AGAIN. TWO, OR THREE YEARS AGO NOW UNDER HARRY REID'S LEADERSHIP 14  AMENDMENT VOTES.  14. WE'RE IN THE HUNDREDS.  WE'RE BACK INTO VOTING AGAIN,   TRYING TO GET ON THE FLOOR TO   MOVE THINGS.  TWO YEARS AGO ACTUALLY PASSED THE FIRST BALANCED BUDGET PLAN PASSED BY CONGRESS SINCE 2001.  LAID OUT A PATH, DAVID PERDUE, HE, I AND SEVERAL OTHERS WORKING ON PLAN TO REFORM THE BUDGET PROCESS.  HOW WE DO THE BUDGET.  EVERY YEESH SINCE 1974 WE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE SAME THING.  THE BUDGET PROCESS ISN'T WORKING.  MAYBE AT SOME POINT FIX THE PROCESS.  LAYING OUT HOW TO WE FIX THIS   PROCESS AND MAKE IT WORK GETTER?  HOW TO GE WE GET THE SENATE BACK  TO WORK AGAIN? GETTING RID OF COMMON CORE   MANDATES. THAT HAPPENED THIS PAST YEAR. NOT JUST A CONVERSATION. WE PASSED THAT INTO LAW.  WE PUT ON THE PRESIDENT'S DESK A  FULL REPEAL OF OBAMA CARE, PUT   ON THE PRESIDENT'S DESK DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD, SHOCK AMONG SHOCKED, VETOES BOTH BUT BOTH MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO   HIS DESK.  MAJOR HIGHWAY BILL, A NICE PIECE  IN THE ""WALL STREET JOURNAL"" DEALING WITH FREEDOM OF RELIGION.  LOTS OF FOLKS THAT WANT TO EQUATE FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND WORSHIP, THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.  IN OUR CITIZENSHIP UP TO THIS YEAR, ASKED NEW CITIZEN WHAT IS   ONE OF THE FREEDOMS WE HAVE AS A  NATION AND LISTED FREEDOM OF WORSHIP.  I CHALLENGED THEM ON IT.  THAT'S NOT WHAT OUR CONSTITUTION SAYS.  FREEDOM OF WORSHIP MEANS IF   YOU'RE IN THAT SPECIFIC PLACE AT  A SPECIFIC TIME YOU CAN WORSHIP HOW YOU WANT TO.  WE HAVE THE FREE EXERCISE OF   RELIGION. THAT MEANS YOU CAN WORSHIP ANYPLACE, ANYTIME AND LIVE YOUR   FAITH OUT NOT ONLY IN YOUR   CHURCH HOUSE BUT ANYWHERE YOU   CHOOSE TO, BECAUSE WE HAVE THE   FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION. THE -- THE IMMIGRATION FOLKS --   -- THE IMMIGRATION FOLKS INITIALLY SAID, NO THEY'RE GOING  TO LEAVE THE TEXT AS-IS, CONTINUED TO PRESS AND A LETTER BACK SAYING YOU'RE RIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THIS TO   WHAT OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT   IS. ""WALL STREET JOURNAL"" HAS A NICE PIECE ABOUT THAT. THESE ARE SMALL VICTORIES BUT   ADD UP SMALL VICTORIES AND WE'RE  TURNING THE SHIP.  TRYING TO RIOTOUS OUT OF THE STORM.  AND IT WILL BE A LONG WAY.  I WILL TELL YOU THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE THIS SENSE THAT OUR HOPE SHOULD BE IN WASHINGTON.  I WOULD TELL YOU OUR HOPE SHOULD  NOT BE IN WASHINGTON. I WOULD SAY WE HAVE A HIGHER   HOPE THAN THAT. I WOULD ALSO TELL YOU THAT FOR   ALL OF THE FOLKS THAT BELIEVE IF  WE JUST ELECT THE RIGHT PEOPLE   THEY WILL CHANGE THE NATION.  LET ME REMIND YOU OF SOMETHING. WASHINGTON DOESN'T CHANGE THE COUNTRY.  THE COUNTRY CHANGES WASHINGTON.  SO THE WAY THIS WILL TURN AROUND  IS A LOT HARDER.  IT IS THE ENGAGEMENT OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU.  THAT WILL ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN THE  HARD WORK, BECAUSE THIS IS   TOUGHER THAN WE WANT TO SAY IT   IS AT TIMES. QUITE FRANKLY, THERE IS THIS   SENSE THAT IF WE COULD ONLY GET WASHINGTON TO FLIP IT WILL FLIP   EVERYTHING ELSE, AND AS WE COME TO THE REALITY OF, IT WILL REALLY FLIP WHEN WE CHANGE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS, OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR   CHURCHES.  THAT'S WHERE THE WORK BEGINS.  BUT THAT'S WHERE IT ACTUALLY WORKS.  IN THE END.  SO HERE'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO   CHALLENGE YOU FOR. JUST A FEW THINGS. I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO  DO SOMETHING BOLD. VOTE. LEAN IN. GET ENGAGED.  IT'S AMAZING TO ME THE NUMBER OF  CHRISTIANS THAT STEP BACK AND   SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I IT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IT'S ONE VOTE.  TIRING, IT'S A LONG LINE.  I'M MAD AT THIS CANDIDATE OR   THIS CANDIDATE.  I'M JUST NOT GOING TO VOTE.  TELL YOU WHAT, THAT IS A SURE   SIGN OF WATCHING GOD JUST BE REMOVED FROM ANY KIND OF   INFLUENCE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.  IF WE AS THE CHURCH FAIL TO STEP UP AND VOTE, WE AND KATEBDICATE ALL OF   THAT LEADERSHIP TO EVERYONE ELSE  WHO'S NOT IN THE CHURCH.  THE CHURCH HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO STEP UP AND MAKE SURE OUR   VOICES ARE ACTUALLY HEARD.  THE CHURCH HAS THE   RESPONSIBILITY TO STEP UP AND   SAY, OUR TASK IS OUR TASK.  I AM AFRAID AND AS A PERSON WHO'S BEEN IN MINISTRY TWO DECADES, I AM CONCERNED THAT AT   TIMES THE CHURCH IS SAYING, YOU KNOW WHAT? GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO TAKE CARE   OF THAT.  GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO TAKE CARE   OF THOSE IN POVERTY, THOSE WITH GREAT NEED.  GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF ALL OF THOSE ESCHEWHERB ISSUES.  WE HAVE 4.1 FEDERAL EMPLOYEES. HIGHEST IN THE HISTORY OF THE GOVERNMENT.  OUR FEDERAL BUDGET IS OVER $4 TRILLION. THE HIGHEST BUDGET THAT IT'S   EVER BEEN IN THE HISTORY OF THE   GOVERNMENT. HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT FOR US? YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE A SIMPLE   SOLUTION? MAYBE A SIMPLE SOLUTION IS TO SAY, MAYBE THE CHURCH NEEDS TO STEP UP AND BE THE CHURCH AGAIN.  TO ACTUALLY DO WHAT WE ARE   CALLED TO DO.  FOUNDATION OF THE NATION,   FOUNDATION OF THE NATION HAS   ALWAYS BEEN OUR FAMILIES. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE.  YOU SEE, GOVERNMENT RISES AND GETS BIGGER WHEN FAMILIES COLLAPSE.  AND AS FAMILIES FALTER, GOVERNMENT RISES AND TRIES TO   HELP CHILDREN THAT ARE EXPOSED,   TRIES TO HELP MOMS EXPOSED, HELP  IN EDUCATION AND CRIMINAL   JUSTICE. ALL BASED ON THE COLLAPSE OF THE  FAMILY.  SO THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO GET BIGGER, BIGGER, BIGGER TO   SOLVE THE ISSUE OF THE FAMILY.  GOVERNMENT'S NOT A GREAT   SOLUTION FOR FAMILIES.  CHURCHES ARE.  IF CHURCH WAS TO LEAN IN AND   SAY, I'M GOING TO MENTOR A YOUNG FAMILY SO WE DON'T SEE THE DIVORCE RATE WE HAVE.  WE HAVE 400,000 CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER FAMILY.  IF EVERY CHURCH ADOPTED ONE   CHILD OR HAVE ONE FOSTER FAMILY   IN THEIR CHURCH ONE FOSTER   FAMILY, WE WOULD SOLVE THE   FOSTER CARE IN OUR NATION. SPECIFIC WAYS OUR CHURCH CAN   STEP UP AND LEAD IN THIS AND WE   ARE AT OUR BEST WHEN WE ACTUALLY  DO THAT. YOU SEE, WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT   GOVERNMENT IS THE FINAL SOLUTION. WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN CRAZY VERSES LIKE PSALM 121, I LIFT MY  EYES UP TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS.  THERE'S A HILL HIGHER THAN   CAPITOL HILL. WHERE DOES MY HELP COME FROM? MY HELP COMES FROM THE LORD,   MAKER OF HEAVEN AND EARTH.  WE GET THE BIGGER PICTURE. IT'S NOT CAPITOL HILL THAT'S THE  PINNACLE SPOT.  WE UNDERSTAND THERE IS SOMETHING  BIGGER, BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND   THAT IT'S NOT ONLY THE RIGHT   THING TO DO THERE'S A RIGHT WAY TO DO IT.  LET ME TELL YOU ONE OF THE   CHALLENGES THE CHURCH HAS, AND WHAT WE HAVE AS CHRISTIANS.  WE GET DRAWN INTO THE SIREN SONG OF THE ANGRY VOICES, AND WE AY SOUP THAT'S THE WAY WE'RE GOING   TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  PETER WROTE TO A CHURCH IN A   PAGAN SOCIETY AND HE SAID TO   THEM I CHALLENGE YOU TO BE   ALIENS AND STRANGERS IN THIS WORLD, TO LIVE SUCH GOOD LIVES AMOUNG GENERAL STEILS THOUGH THEY ACCUSE YOU OF DOING WRONG   THEY MAY SEE YOUR GOOD WORKS AND  GLORIFY THE LORD ON THE DAY HE   VISIT US AND FIVE IDEAS TO STAND OUT IN A CROWD.  NUMBER ONE, HONOR AUTHORITY. YOU WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY, WE DO POLITICS IN A DIFFERENT WAY.  WE STAND UP FOR WHAT'S RIGHT AND  WE HONOR AUTHORITY AT THE SAME   TIME WE'RE DOING IT.  THE WHOLE WORLD WILL LOOK AT US,  SAY, WHY DO YOU DO THAT?  IT GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO   PRESENT TRUTH.  WE ARE NOT CONSUMED WITH BEING THE ANGRIEST.  WE ARE CONSUMED WITH BEING RIGHT.  AND DOING GOD'S WORK, GOD'S WAY.  AND AT TIMES I BELIEVE WE PRAY   FOR REVIVAL, BECAUSE IT SOUNDS SO MUCH EASIER THAN ACTUALLY   DOING THE WORK.  YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO? LET'S LEAN IN.  LET'S DO THE WORK. BECAUSE THERE IS MUCH TO BE DONE  IN OUR NATION, AND THE CHURCH OF  ALL PEOPLE SHOULD LEAD. I HAVE A JOB.  I'VE BEEN GIVEN IT BY THE PEOPLE  OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA, AND I   WILL DO IT WITH ALL MY MIGHT BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT TO GET   DONE, BUT WE TOGETHER HAVE MUCH   TO GET DONE TOGETHER.  LET'S DO IT.  GOD BLESS Y'ALL.   >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE HELP ME WELCOME TO THE STAGE THE  NATIONAL EXECUTIVE DIRECT EVERY   OF FREEDOM AND FAITH COALITION, TIMOTHY HEDD.   >> ENCOURAGED? YOU FEELIN' IT?  YOU UNDERSTAND NOW WHY WE PULL TOGETHER AND WHY WE, THE PEOPLE   THAT WE INVITE TO COME   PARTICIPATE, AT LEAST FOR ME, IT'S INCREDIBLY ENCOURAGING TO   HEAR AND SEE AND ALMOST BE ABLE TO REACH OUT AND TOUCH THE ACTUAL PEOPLE THAT, THAT CARRY THE VALUES, CARRY THE VERY BURDENS THAT WE OURSELVES CARRY   IN OUR OWN HEARTS AND MINDS.  SO THANK YOU SO MUCH, SENATOR LANGFORD, FOR THOSE REMARKS.  MAKING IT HAPPEN AS THE SENATOR   JUST TOLD US IS A DIFFERENT ANIMAL.  IT'S AN ADDITIONAL ANIMAL, A   DIFFERENT SKILL SET.  WE WANT QUICK RESULTS, WE WANT   FAST, URGENT, IMMEDIATE RESULTS, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?  SOMETIMES THE LONG-TERM RESULTS   TAKE THE LONG GAME.  THEY REQUIRE A LONGER PERSPECTIVE THAN JUST ONE   CONGRESSIONAL CYCLE, ONE   ELECTION CYCLE SOMETIMES, EVEN. THE -- OUR NEXT -- NEXT PRESENTATION IS GOING TO COME FROM A GENTLEMAN WHO UNDERSTANDS  THAT INTRINSICALLY.  THE UNITED STATES SENATE IS A COMPLICATED BODY. THE PERSONALITIES INVOLVED ARE SOMETIMES ELABORATE PERSONALITIES.  THE RULES THEMSELVES ARE NUANCED AND INTRICATE RULES AND THE POLICY ITSELF IS WHAT WE TALK ABOUT ALL DAY EVERY DAY.  BUT IT'S MY PLEASURE TO WELCOME   THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER WHO   NOT ONLY UNDERSTANDS THE VALUES AND THE PRINCIPLES THAT MAKE US   WHO WE ARE BUT ALSO UNDERSTANDS THE PROCESS IN ORDER TO MAKE   THIS STUFF ACTUALLY HAPPEN.  WOULD YOU PLEASE JOIN ME IN   WELCOMING THE LEADER OF THE   SENATE MAJORITY, MITCH McCONNELL.   >> WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH,   TIM.  IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.  HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM TWO OF OUR FINEST IN SENATOR PERDUE AND SENATOR JAMES   LANGFORD, AND I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY THIS YEAR ONCE AGAIN.  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ELECT ADD NEW REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN 2014, THEY CALLED FOR THE SENATE TO   GET BACK TO WORK. AS JAMES POINTED OUT, THE PREVIOUS MAJORITY DIDN'T DO MUCH. AT 15 ROLE CALL VOTES ON   AMENDMENTS IN AN ENTIRE YEAR. THEY WANTED AN ""IN"" TO DEMOCRATIC DYSFUNCTION.  THEY KNEW IT WAS TIME TO GO IN A  NEW DIRECTION, AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DELIVERED SINCE TAKING   OFFICE IN JANUARY OF 2015.  WE PASSED THE MOST IMPORTANT K   THROUGH 12 EDUCATION REFORM IN MORE THAN DECADE.  YOU'VE HEARD IT PUTS KIDS AND PARENTS FIRST. IT GETS RID, LET ME REPEAT THAT,  IT GETS RID OF NO CHIND LEFT   BEHIND AND IT'S ONE SIZE FITS ALL MANDATE. IT PREVENTS -- PREVENTS WASHINGTON FROM IMPOSING COMMON   CORE.  YOU'RE AMAZED THAT OBAMA SIGNED IT.  RIGHT?  HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CHOICE.  IT'S A CONSERVATIVE WHIM   DESCRIBED AS THE LARGEST EVOLUTION OF FEDERAL CONTROL TO   THE STATE IN A QUARTER CENTURY.  PASSED THE MOST IMPORTANT   LONG-TERM TRANSPORTATION REFORM   IN NEARLY TWO DECADES.  IT REVEALS OUR NATION'S HIGHWAYS AND CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE.  REDUCES WASTE. IT GIVES LOCAL COMMUNITIES MORE   CONTROL OVER HOW FUNDS ARE ACTUALLY SPENT, AND IT DOESN'T RAISE TAXES BY A PENNY. WE ENACTED PERMANENT TAX RELIEF   FOR FAMILIES IN SMALL BUSINESSES. WE REPLACED SEVERAL WASHINGTON   ANNUAL KICK THE CAN EXERCISES WITH MEANINGFUL RESPORMS.  WE EVEN BROUGHT AN END TO THE JOB-KILLING SELF-IMPOSED OIL EMBARGO FROM THE 1970s.  MANY OF THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN TANGLED IN GRIDLOCK LITERALLY   FOR YEARS AND THEN A NEW   MAJORITY CAME ALONG. NOW, EACH OF THOSE IS ACTUALLY   LAW.  NO EVERYTHING WE PASSED RECEIVED A PRESIDENTIAL SIGNATURE, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE.  WE VOTED TO BUILD THE KEYSTONE   PIPELINE WHICH WOULD HAVE   CREATED 20,000 JOBS. HE XREET OHVETOED IT PT VOTED TO END THE  PAIN OF OBAMA CARE. PUT IT ON HIS DESK. HE VOTE OHHED IT. WE VOTED TO DEFUND PLANNED   PARENTHOOD.  BUT, OF COURSE, HE VETOED IT.  WE PUT MEASURES LIKE THESE ON   THE PRESIDENT'S DESK AFTER YEARS  OF HARRY REID PROTECTING HIM   FROM TOUGH CHOICES.  HE NEVER GOT THOSE KIND OF BILLS  ON HIS DESK.  IT SHOWS WHAT'S POSSIBLE IF WE E ELECT A NEW PRESIDENT NEXT YEAR.  IT'S ANOTHER DEMONSTRATION OF   WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY IN THE   SENATE THAT NOT ONLY BACK TO   WORK BUT BACK ON THE SIDE OF THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE.  IT ALSO SHOWS WHAT'S POSSIBLE WITH PERSEVERANCE.  I TAKE THE COMPREHENSIVE   ANTI-HUMAN TRAFFICKING LAW   PASSED LAST YEAR.  THIS WILL BE HARD FOR YOU TO BELIEVE, BUT COUNTLESS INNOCENT VICTIMS ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD INTO  MODERN DAY SLAVERY EVERY YEAR IN  OUR COUNTRY.  TOO MANY HAVE NOWHERE SAFE TO SLEEP.  TOO MANY HAVE NOWHERE SAFE TO TURN.  TOO MANY ARE ABUSED AND MADE TO FEEL INVISIBLE. AND MANY ARE JUST CHILDREN. WE THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO   FINALLY BRING JUSTICE TO THESE VICTIMS.  WE THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO FINALLY BRING VOICES TO THE   VOICELESS AND HOPE TO THE   SUFFERING AND THE SHADOWS.  SO WE PASSED THE JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT.  YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE   EASY, BUT IT WASN'T.  IT WASN'T.  DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY FILIBUSTERED   THIS ANTI-SLAVERY LEGISLATION FOREOVER A MONTH.  LET ME TELL YOU WHY. THE FAR LEFT WANTED TO FIGHT OVER THE HUD AMENDMENT.  OVER THE HUD AMENDMENT. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS. THE LONG-STANDING PRINCIPLE THAT  SAYS FEDERAL TAX DOLLARS SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTIVE ABORTIONS.  A VICTORY IN FEDERAL LAW FOR DECADES.  IT ACTUALLY ENJOYS BIPARTISAN   SUPPORT FOR DECADES, BUT SOME ON  THE FAR LEFT WANTED TO CHANGE AND THAT AND THOUGHT   FILIBUSTERING AN ANTI-SLAVERY   BILL WAS THE APPROPRIATE VENUE TO GET THEIR WAY.  WE WERE DETERMINED TO FIGHT THIS EFFORT IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE   HUD AMENDMENT AND EVENTUALLY OVERCAME THIS SHAMEFUL   FILIBUSTER AND THE HUD AMENDMENT  WAS INTACT WHEN THE PRESIDENT   FINALLY SIGNED THE BILL.  WE EVENTUALLY PASSED CRITICAL,   COMPASSIONATE AND COMPREHENSIVE   LEGISLATION TO HELP VICTIMS OF MODERN SLAVERY AND, OF COURSE,   THE PRESIDENT HAD TO CHOICE AT   THAT POINT BUT TO SIGN IT.  THIS REPUBLICAN-LED SENATE IS   DEDICATED TO FIGHTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING, COMBATING SEXUAL   ASSAULT, AND HELPING PROTECT THOSE WHO SUFFERED FROM THESE HEINOUS CRIMES.  THAT'S WHY WE PASSED --   -- THAT'S WHY WE ALSO PASS ADD   BILL THAT HELPS VICTIMS OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY GET RESTITUTION FROM  THOSE WHO FROST FROM THEIR PAIN   AND TOOK STEPS TO CRACK DOWN ON SO-CALLED PASS THE TRASH PRACTICE OF SCHOOLS. WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS CHIPPING CHILD PREDATORS TO   OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS.  THAT'S WHY JUST LAST MONTH WE WERE NOT -- WE NOT ONLY REAUTHORIZED THE ADAM WALLCHACK   BUT PROVIDED ADDITIONAL RIGHTS   AND PROTECTIONS FOR VICTIMS OF   SEXUAL ASSAULT.  SO THE SENATE IS GETTING A LOT DONE. AND THAT PROGRESS CONTINUES THIS DAY.  THIS ACTUAL DAY.  IN FACT, WE JUST LEFT THE FLOOR   WITHIN A FEW, WITHIN THAT HOUR,   THE SENATE TOOK AN IMPORTANT   STEP TOWARDS PASSING THE MOST   SWEEPING REFORMS TO THE DEFENSE   DEPARTMENT ORGANIZATION IN A GENERATION. THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT THAT WILL SOON  PASS FINALLY.  WE HAD A BIG STEP ABOUT AN HOUR   AGO, IS LEGISLATION THAT WILL   MODERNIZE OUR MILITARY AND   PROVIDE OUR TROOPS WITH MORE OF   THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO CONFRONT   THE THREAT THAT WE FACE.  AND AS YOU ALREADY KNOW, THE   CHALLENGES ARE ABUNDANT.  EVERYTHING FROM ISIL TO IRAN, TO  RUSSIA TO CHINA, AND THEY ARE   COMPLEX. AS HENRY KISSINGER PUT IT WE FACE THE MOST DIVERSE AND   COMPLEX ARRAY OF CRISES SINCE WORLD WAR II.  IF ONLY PRESIDENT OBAMA WERE AS   SERIOUS ABOUT CONFRONTING THESE THREATS AS THEY ARE ABOUT   CONFRONTING US. HE STILL HASN'T PUT FORWARD A   CREDIBLE PLAN TO DEFEAT ISIL. HIS DEAL WITH IRAN CONTINUES TO   REVEAL THE SIGNIFICANT FLAWS EVERY PASSING DAY. AND IF YOU ALLOW ME TO   PARAPHRASE JIMMY CARTER, SOMETHING I RARELY DO, IT'S HARD TO THINK OF MANY PLACES IN THE   WORLD WHERE OUR RELATIONSHIP IS BETTER OFF SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA  TOOK OFFICE.  THAT'S JIMMY CARTER ON BARACK OBAMA. PRESIDENT OBAMA'S GOING TO LEAVE  A LOT OF PROBLEMS TO HIS SUCCESSOR.  WHAT WE CAN DO TODAY IS HELP PREPARE THE NEXT COMMANDER IN   CHIEF TO FACE THESE CHALLENGES. THIS PRO-REFORM, PRO-INNOVATION, PRO-MODERNIZATION DEFENSE BILL   WILL HELP US DO THAT, AND THE SENATE WILL PASS IT VERY SOON.  THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO SIGN UP TO DEFEND OUR NATION DON'T ASK FOR A LOT.  BUT OUR NATION CERTAINLY ASKS A   LOT OF THEM. WHEN DEPLOYED THEY DESERVE THE   EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING NECESSARY  TO ACTUALLY DO THEIR JOBS.  AND LET ME ALSO MENTION WHEN THEY COME BACK HOME THEY DESERVE ALL OF OUR SUPPORT.  DON'T THEY?  THIS IS WHY WE'RE WORKING TO   PASS THE MOST SWEEPING OVERHAUL OF THE MILITARY HEALTH SYSTEM IN  A GENERATION.  THIS IS WHY WE HAVE ALREADY   PASSED LEGISLATION TO SUPPORT   WOUNDED WARRIORS, VETERANS WHO   STRUGGLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND EARLIER THIS WEEK  TO SUPPORT FEMALE VETERANS IN   PARTICULAR WHO NEED OUR HELP.  THIS IS ALSO WHY WE VOTED TO   ENHANCE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OVER AT THE V.A.  WHAT WE'VE SEEN AT THE V.A. IN RECENT YEARS IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE.  A NATIONAL DISGRACE. AND IT'S HARDLY THE ONLY SCANDAL  WE'VE SEEN OVER THE COURSE OF   THIS ADMINISTRATION. JUST THIS WEEK THE IRS WAS   FINALLY FORCED TO HAND OVER A LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS IT HAD   TARGETED FOR THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS.  THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF CONSERVATIVE GROUPS ON THE LIST. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S   CONSERVATIVE SPEECH SUPPRESSION SCANDAL SHOCKED A LOT OF AMERICANS WHEN IT FIRST CAME TO LIGHT.  IT WAS BRAZEN.  IT'S WHY WE PASSED REFORMS THAT WILL HELP PREVENT ANOTHER LOIS LERNER.  HERE'S WHAT'S CLEAR FROM LOOKING  AT THE LAST 18 MONTHS -- THE MAJORITY I LEAD HAS GOT A VERY DIFFERENT SET OF PRIORITIES FROM THE ONE WE REPLACED, AND   LET ME JUST HESITATE A MOMENT   AND TELL YOU THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING IN THE MAJORITY AND BEING IN THE MINORITY.  WHEN I BECAME THE MAJORITY   LEADER INSTEAD OF THE MINORITY   LEADER I SAID TO PEOPLE, I'M NOW  THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR.  I USED TO BE THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR IF YOU'RE A FOOTBALL FAN YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR CALLS THE PLAYS HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF  PUTTING POINTS ON THE BOARD.  THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER SETS THE SCHEDULE. THE ESSENTIAL I'VE SET ISSCHEDULE I'VE SET IS DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT  HARRY REID WAS DOING FOR THE   SENATE IN THE PAST.  SO WHAT WE'RE FREFTINTERESTED IN IS A  BETTER ECONOMY AND MORE   OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MIDDLE   CLASS. WE'RE INTERESTED IN A STRONGER   NATIONAL DEFENSE AT A TIME OF COUNTLESS GLOBAL THREATS.  AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO DEFENDING  THE FIRST AMENDMENT.  CONGRESS IS YOUR FIRST LINE OF   DEFENSE WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING THIS FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT.  THE SUPREME COURT IS THE LAST   LINE OF DEFENSE. THE ""NEW YORK TIMES"" RECENTLY RAN A HEADLINE DECLARING A SUPREME COURT WITH MERRITT   GARLAND WOULD BE THE MOST   LIBERAL IN DECADES. IF JUDGE GARLAND IS CONFIRMED THE ""NEW YORK TIMES"" ALSO   SPECULATED HE COULD TIP THE   IDEOLOGICAL BALANCE TO CREATE THE MOST LIBERAL SUPREME COURT   IN 50 YEARS.  THAT'S WHY PRESIDENT OBAMA IS TRYING TO AIRDROP ANOTHER   SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ON HIS WAY  OUT THE DOOR, AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS ELECTION.  HE THINKS HE CAN GET AWAY WITH   IT, TOO.  IF HIS NOMINEE IS PORTRAYED AS   SOME KIND OF MODERATE. LET ME TELL YOU, PRESIDENT OBAMA  CALLED SOMEBODY A MODERATE DOES   NOT MAKE HIM A MODERATE.  HE'S CLEARLY NOT A MODERATE.  AMERICA'S LARGEST ORGANIZATION   OF GUN OWNERS EXAMINE THE   RECORD. WHAT IT FOUND -- A JUDGE WHO DOES NOT RESPECT OUR  FUNDAMENTAL, INDIVIDUAL RIGHT TO  KEEP AND BEAR ARMS FOR SELF-DEFENSE. AMERICA'S LARGEST ORGANIZATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES EXAMINED HIS  RECORD, TOO.  WHAT IT FOUND. A JUDGE WHO NEARLY ALWAYS SIDES WITH REGULATORS, LABOR UNIONS   AND TRIAL LAWYERS AT THE EXPENSE  OF SMALL BUSINESSES. SO LET ME SAY THIS ONCE MORE AND  LET ME SAY IT CLEARLY -- BARACK OBAMA WILL NOT GET A   SUPREME COURT JUSTICE IN THE 11th HOUR OF HIS PRESIDENCY ON THE WAY OUT THE DOOR.  WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR.  THE PRESIDENT WE'RE IN THE   PROCESS OF SELECTING WILL MAKE THIS CHOICE, AND WILL EITHER TURN THE COURT IN THE RIGHT OR   WRONG DIRECTION DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF THIS NOVEMBER'S ELECTION.  THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY THE SENATE SHOULD KNOCK THIS YEAR.  YOU'VE HEARD ME LAY THEM OUT BEFORE.  EVEN VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN BACK   IN 1992 IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEAR WHEN HE WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY  SYSTEM SAID IF A VACANCY   OCCURRED THEY WOULDN'T FILL IT.  BEEN A VERY USEFUL QUOTE.  SO, LOOK, WE CLEARLY DISAGREE WITH THE DEMOCRATS ON THIS ISSUE.  BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T   CONTINUE TO FIND OTHER AREAS OF AGREEMENT, WHICH I'VE BEEN   TALKING ABOUT.  SO THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING   WITH THE NEW REPUBLICAN   MAJORITY. WE KNOW WE HAVE BIG DIFFERENCES, AND ON THOSE WE'VE PUT IT ON THE PRESIDENT'S DESK LIKE OBAMA CARE.  HE'S VEVETOED, DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD, HE VETOED IT.  BUT AMERICANS EXPECT US TO WORK ON THINGS WE CAN AGREE ON AND WE'VE WORKED TO FIND COMMON GROUND.  GOTTEN SIGNIFICANT THINGS DONE FOR THE COUNTRY, EVEN THOUGH WE   HAVE A PRESIDENT WITH WHOM WE DIFFER ON A LARGE ARRAY OF ISSUES.  WHERE WE'VE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES   WE'VE SHOWN WHAT'S POSSIBLE WITH  A PRESIDENT FROM THE SAME PARTY   BY POINTING OUT HE VETOED THESE BILLS, A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT   WOULD HAVE SIGNED THEM.  SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO MAKE PROGRESS TODAY.  THE SENATE IS BACK TO WORK.  THE SENATE IS BACK ON THE SIDE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD TO LEAD  THIS NEW MAJORITY AND I COULDN'T BE PROUDER OF ALL OF YOU.  THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY AND   FOR HAVING ME HERE TO GIVE MY REMARKS.  THANK YOU.   >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE   WELCOME TO THE STAGE FAITH AND FREEDOM COALITION NATIONAL FIELD DIRECTOR JOHN HARISON.  >> GOOD MORNING.  IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE WITH YOU ALL THIS MORNING. AS A CITIZEN OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA, I'M PROUD AND I HAVE A   DISTINCT PRIVILEGE AND HONOR   THIS MORNING TO INTRODUCE TO YOU  MY SENATOR, SENATOR JEFF   SESSIONS.  SENATOR SESSIONS AS WE KNOW IN ALABAMA, HE'S A STEADFAST CONSERVATIVE.  HE IS A VONG ADVOCATE FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND HIS UNWAVERING   SUPPORT OF AMERICA'S MEN AND   WOMEN IN UNIFORM.  HE GREW UP IN RURAL ALABAMA,   WORKED HIS WAY THROUGH HUNTINGTON COLLEGE IN   MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA AND WENT TO   THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA LAW SCHOOL.  PRESIDENT REAGAN APPOINTED HIM AS A UNITED STATES ATTORNEY IN   THE DISTRICT IN ALABAMA AND WE ARE SO PROUD THAT HE IS OUR SENATOR.  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE   JOIN ME IN WELCOMING SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS.   >> THANK YOU.  THANK YOU, JOHN, AND FOR THE   GOOD WORK YOU DO, AND ALL OF YOU DO, TO ADVANCE FAITH AND FREEDOM.  IT'S A CORNERSTONE OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.  OUR SUCCESS AS A NATION, AND WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN AN UNDERSTAND A REALLY EXCEPTIONAL DEVELOPMENT   OF THIS COUNTRY AND THESE ISSUES, WHY THEY'RE SO IMPORTANT. I'M GLAD TO FOLLOW MITCH   McCONNELL AND HE MENTIONED THE   SUPREME COURT VACANCY.  AN IMPORTANT ISSUE.  I MAY TALK ABOUT IT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO, BUT WHEN JUSTICE SCALIA, ONE OF THE GREAT JUSTICES EVER   TO SIT ON THE SUPREME COURT --   -- A MAN OF EXCEPTIONAL LEGAL   BRILLIANCE AND A MAN OF DEEP RELIGIOUS FAITH, AND UNDERSTOOD   HOW IT ALL CAME TOGETHER,   UNDERSTOOD AND LOVED THE AMERICA THAT WE'VE BEEN BEQUEATHED, WHEN  HE DIED I THOUGHT, I SAID, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I SHOULD CALL MITCH,  AND ASK HIM TO SAY RIGHT AWAY, DON'T WAIT, JUST SAY RIGHT AWAY,  WE'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE ANYBODY   THIS YEAR.  IT'S TOO LATE. WE'RE GOING TO LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DECIDE IN THE NEXT   ELECTION WHO SHOULD SIT ON THIS 4-4 STREAM COURT.  AND BEFORE I COULD GET AROUND TO  DOING IT HE DID IT INSTINCTIVELY AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH   YOU THAT ON THE QUESTION OF THE COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND ON GOOD LAW  ENFORCEMENT FOR PROTECTING US   FROM THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT, MITCH  McCONNELL IS ABSOLUTELY ROCK   SOLID.  IT'S A PLEASURE FOR ME TO SERVE WITH HIM, TIME AND AGAIN HE   STOOD UP TO EVEN MEMBERS OF OUR OWN CONNELL TO PROMOTE THE KIND OF JUDICIARY THAT YOU AND I   BELIEVE IN. WELL, YOU KNOW, I TOLD OUR COLLEAGUES A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO -- MAYBE I'M A LITTLE WARPED  IN THE BRAIN, BUT I TOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AREN'T HAPPY AND  I'M NOT HAPPY.  I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M ON THEIR SIDE.  YOU KNOW?  PEOPLE DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE  ECONOMY. THEY DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT A LOT OF ISSUES FACING US.  THEY DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE HOSTILITY TO RELIGION THAT THEY   FEEL OUT THERE, AND THEY'RE NOT   HAPPY ABOUT IT, AND THE POLLS   SHOW THAT THE WRONG TRACK IS   EXCEEDINGLY HIGH, AND IT'S   REMAINED THAT WAY IN POLL QUESTION AFTER POLL QUESTION. PEOPLE SAYING THIS COUNTRY IS ON  THE WRONG TRACK. AND I THINK IT IS.  I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE   FUNDAMENTALLY CORRECT, AND I BELIEVE THAT IT'S RIGHT AND   MORAL AND JUST AND BIBLICAL THAT WE HAVE A LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION FOR THE NATION STATE  THAT WE SERVE, AND I KNOW, AND WE'VE HAD ECONOMISTS COME AND TESTIFY BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE,   THAT IS HARVARD PROFESSOR, THE   WORLD'S LEADING EXPERT ON IT, THAT YOU BRING IN MORE LABOR   THAN WE CAN ABSORB, POOR PEOPLE HAVE THEIR WAGES GO DOWN.  POOR PEOPLE HAVE THEIR JOB   PROSPECTS GO DOWN. THINGS AREN'T GOING GOOD OUT THERE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,   AND ONE OF THE REASONS IS THAT   THE EXTRAORDINARY UNPRECEDENTED   RATE OF IMMIGRATION INTO OUR COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY IN LOWER   SKILLS, AND IT'S HAMMERING GOOD AND DECENT PEOPLE WHO NEED TO BE  ABLE TO RAISE A FAMILY AND TAKE   CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN, AND THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO SO   EFFECTIVELY, AND I BELIEVE WE CAN DO BETTER ON THAT.  I KNOW THAT WE CAN.  YOU KNOW, I RECALL NEHEMIAH   RETURNING AND ASKED FOR PERMISSION TO COME HOME AND THE   KING LET HIM GO, AND HE WENT HOME.  JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A HUMOROUS JOKE.  I DON'T INTEND -- TO DO WHAT? TO BUILD A WALL.  HE WENT TO BUILD A WALL IN JERUSALEM.   AND IT WASN'T TO KEEP THE PEOPLE  IN. YOU KNOW?  GIVE ME A BREAK.  SO I JUST THINK THAT WE NEED TO   UNDERSTAND THAT WE IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES   REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  WE CAN'T DO EVERYTHING FOR   EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD. WE ARE A NATION STATE, AND NATION STATES ACT LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO.  WHEN PAUL SAID, BE LOYAL TO THE   STATE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE PAGAN WRONG.  HE WASN'T TALKING ABOUT, YOU   KNOW -- JEWISH THEOCRACY.  I JUST WOULD SAY TO YOU, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT. AND, ALSO, WHEN NEHEMIAH CAME ON  HE ASKED FOR LETTERS TO ALLOW HIM TO GO THROUGH OTHER COUNTRIES, AND THE KING GAVE IT TO HILL.  JOSHUA, REMEMBER?  WHEN WE CAME INTO THE HOLY LAND HE ASKED PERMISSION TO GO THROUGH, I GUESS, MOABITES OR   SOMEWHERE AND THEY WOULDN'T LET HIM.  WE'LL PAY YOU MONEY. NO.  WE'LL DO ALL THIS. GO OUR WAY AROUND?  NO.  SO HE WENT AROUND.  SO THE IDEA THAT NATIONS DON'T   SET LAWS, ESTABLISH WHO CAN AND CAN'T ENTER IS NOT BIBLICAL IN   MY OPINION. NATIONS DO THAT, AND THEY'VE   DONE IT SINCE TIME IN MEMORIAL, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. WE JUST NEED TO HAVE A FAIR SYSTEM THAT GIVES PEOPLE AN   EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY AND   THOSE WHO MEET THE STANDARDS CAN  BE ACCEPTED IN NUMBERS THAT DON'T EXCESSIVELY EXACERBATE THE WAGES AND INCOMES OF POOR AMERICANS. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT OF ALL RACES AND ETHNIC GROUPS.  PARTICULARLY MINORITY GROUPS   THAT SUFFER THE MOST FROM THAT.  ONE MORE THING. YOU KNOW, JESUS TALKED ABOUT THE  POOR A LOT.  AND WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THAT.  AND GIVE REAL THOUGHT TO IT. IN MY VIEW, I'VE CHANGED. I'VE SUPPORTED VIRTUALLY EVERY TRADE AGREEMENT THAT HAS COME FORWARD, BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT TRADE AGREEMENTS AREN'T SERVING   THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EFFECTIVELY.  I KNOW THE IDEALS AND BELIEF IN   FREE MARKETS AND THAT, BUT OUR   COMPETITORS, BUSINESS ALLIES, BUT ECONOMIC KPT COMPETITORS,   THEY DON'T OPERATE ON A SAME WAY  WE DO, AND SO IT'S NOT A PURELY LEVEL PLAYING FIELD.  WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED THE   KOREAN TRADE DEAL, WITH OUR GOOD FRIENDS IN SOUTH KOREA, HE   PROMISED WE WOULD INCREASE EXPORTS TO SOUTH KOREA BY $11 BILLION, $12 BILLION A YEAR.  LAST YEAR SINCE 2011 WHEN IT WAS  SIGNED, LAST YEAR, WE HAD ABOUT   A $20 MILLION INCREASE.  WE'VE HAD NO INCREASE IN OUR EXPORTS TO KOREA, BUT THEY HAD A $12 BILLION, $15 BILLION INCREASE TO US AND THE TRADE   DEFICIT WITH KOREA, BECAUSE IT   IS HARD THROUGH ALL KINDS OF MECHANISMS TO EXPORT TO CHINA,   KOREA AND MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS, BUT WE OPEN OUR   BUSINESSES AND WE RESULT IN A FLOOD OF IMPORTS OFTEN MANIPULATED THROUGH CURRENCY TO   MAKE THEM LESS EXPENSIVE THAN WHAT WE MAKE IN THE UNITED STATES.  OFTEN SUBSIDIZED, PART OF A   PRODUCT TO DIRECTLY ATTACK OUR   AMERICAN INDUSTRY OFTEN, SO I   JUST SAY TO YOU IT IS TIME FOR   US TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS HAS   CONSEQUENCES, IF WE -- THESE   ERRORS WE'VE MADE. IT'S NOT WORKING THE WAY IT'S   BEEN PROMISED, AND WE FOUND THE FLAWS IN THE TRADE DEALS, AND IN  THEIR COMPUTER MODELS, THEY LAY OUT THESE POSITIVE PROJECTIONS,   AND IT'S JUST NOT A RIGHT THING.  SO I THINK WE NEED TO LISTEN TO   THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT THIS.  THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH HAVING A LAWFUL SYSTEM OF   IMMIGRATION THAT SERVES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  NOTHING WRONG WITH SAYING, TRADE  AGREEMENTS SHOULDN'T JUST BENEFIT THE CORPORATE ELITE, BUT  ALSO OUGHT TO GIVE A FAIR CHANCE  FOR MANUFACTURING PLANTS, THE   AMERICAN WORKER TO HAVE A GOOD   JOB IN THIS COUNTRY.  NOW, THE SUPREME COURT IS 4-4.  JUST UNBELIEVABLE WE'VE HAD THIS  LONG BATTLE FOR ALL OF THESE YEARS.  SO MANY OF YOU HAVE FOLLOWED IT   CLOSELY AND YOU UNDERSTAND IT   VERY CLEARLY AND NOW WITH THE LOSS OF OFTEN THE FIFTH VOTE, JUSTICE SCALIA, WE ARE FACING A CRITICAL TIME.  RALPH REID TOLD ME THE OTHER   DAY, HE SAID, YOU KNOW, IT'S   LIKE THIS. WE ACTUALLY HAVE TWO BRANCHES OF  GOVERNMENT AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. DON'T WE? HOWEVER, SO THE COURTS ARE AT   RISK HERE, TOO.  I WAS A RANKING REPUBLICAN ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, AND TO   HANDLE, LEAD THE REPUBLICAN VIEWS ON THE CONFIRMATION OF TWO  HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED WOMEN UP FOR  THE SUPREME COURT. AND WE TRIED OUR BEST TO DO THE   JOB WITH INTEGRITY, WITH FAIRNESS, BUT WITH RIGOR, AND I   FELT LIKE SO MANY OF YOU.  THE COURT HASN'T BEEN PERFORMING  IN A WAY WE WOULD LIKE IT TO. SO WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE? AND WE GOT A LOT OF COMPLAINTS AND ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED, BUT I WANTED TO SHARE ONE WITH YOU THAT I THINK DEFINES WHO WE ARE.  AND DEFINES THE CHALLENGES WE   FACE, AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU IN THIS ROOM -- NEED TO   UNDERSTAND AND REALLY KIND OF   COMMIT OURSELVES TO BEING   SUCCESSFUL ON.  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, WE FOUND, AND SHE HAD GIVEN A NUMBER OF   SPEECHES OVER A DECADE IN WHICH   SHE DISCUSSED THE COURT AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF RULING. SHE QUOTED A PHILOSOPHER, A LEGAL WRITER IN THIS WAY, AND SHE FAVORABLY QUOTED HIM, AND THE -- SHE WOULD ALWAYS SAY, THERE IS NO NEUTRALITY. ""NO OBJECTIVE STANCE BUT A   SERIES OF PERSPECTIVES.""  THAT STILL MAKES THE HAIR STAND   UP ON THE BACK OF OUR NECK.  A JUDGE, TO SAY THERE IS NO   OBJECTIVITY. JUST A SERIES OF PERSPECTIVES, AND THAT THE ASPIRATION TO IMPARTIALITY IS JUST THAT.  AN ASPIRATION. YOU SEE, THIS IS A POST-MODERN, RELATIVISTIC, SECULAR MIND-SET, AND I BELIEVE IT'S DIRECTLY   CONTRARY TO THE FOUNDING OF OUR REPUBLIC.  IF YOU LOOK --   -- WHY DO WE HAVE FREE SPEECH? BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN DEBATE AND EXPRESSION OF IDEAS.  TRUTH COULD BE ASCERTAINED.  WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A TRUTH, FIRST OF ALL, THERE IS ONE.  THERE'S A GOD, CREATOR IN   HEAVEN, WHO ORDERED THIS   UNIVERSE WITH MORAL LAWS JUST AS  WELL AS GRAVITY LAWS.  AND SO WE -- OUR SYSTEM WAS SET   UP TO ALLOW PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF  ISSUES, AND THE FREEDOM TO   EXPRESS YOUR VIEWS.  IT WASN'T TO PRINT CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, BUT IT WAS TO ALLOW FREE DEBATE ON THE IMPORTANT   ISSUES FACING OUR COUNTRY, AND THEN YOU HAVE CONGRESS, AND THE   SENATE HAD UNLIMITED DEBATE, AND  YOU COULD TALK AS LONG AS YOU WANTED TO.  SO CONGRESS COULD DEBATE ALL OF THE ISSUES, BRING IN ALL OF THE FACTS THAT PEOPLE CHOSE TO BRING  IN AND THEN MAKE A TRUTHFUL, HONEST DECISION ON WHAT WAS THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES.  AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR TRIALS AND LAWSUITS?  YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXPRESS YOURSELF THROUGH THE OPENING   STATEMENTS AND THE LAWYERS' STATEMENTS. WITNESSES ARE COMPELLED, EVEN IF  THEY WANT TO, TO COME, TESTIFY UNDER OATH TO THE TRUTH.  AND JURIES ARE SET THERE TO HEAR THE THE EVIDENCE AND OBJECTATIVEIVELY DECIDE WHAT'S TRUE, RIGHT?  NOT WHAT MY PERSPECTIVE TO IS.  YOU KNOW, THIS IS A DANGEROUS PHILOSOPHY IT'S CONTRARY TO WHO   WE ARE AND A PROBLEM WITH THE COURTS.  ONCE THEY TAKE THAT PHILOSOPHY,   THEY'RE NO LONGER BOUND.  A PROFESSOR -- BOUND BY THE WORDS OF THE CONSTITUTION -- WROTE DO YOU REMEMBER HOW THE CONSTITUTION ENDS IT BEGINS WITH  WE THE PEOPLE IT END WE WITH PUT  FORWARD THIS CONSTITUTION. NOT THE ONE THE JUDGE WISHED HAD PASSED.  IF YOU ERODE YOUR COMMITMENT TO   WHAT THE CONSTITUTION SAYS THERE  IS NO PRINCIPLE SUBJECT THAT   CAN'T BE UNDERMINED IN THE FUTURE.  I REALLY THINK THIS WHOLE COURT   SYSTEM IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND   THE REAL VALUE AND BATTLE WE'RE ENGAGED IN HERE IS ONE TO REAFFIRM THAT THERE IS OBJECTIVE  TRUTH. IT'S NOT ALL RELATIVE.  AND THAT MEANS SOME THINGS ARE RIGHT AND SOME THINGS ARE WRONG.  AND WE'RE GETTING TOO FAR AWAY   FROM THAT IN MY OPINION.  IT'S NOT HEALTHY FOR ANY COUNTRY AND IT'S REALLY NOT HEALTHY FOR A DEMOCRACY LIKE OURS THAT'S BUILT ON THE RUELE OF ALL. THANK YOU ALL FOR WHAT YOU DO.  I APPRECIATE YOUR ALLOWING ME TO BE A PART OF THIS.  HOPEFULLY WE CAN TRY TO PUT THIS  COUNTRY BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK.  AND I THINK WE'LL GET A LOT   BETTER TOWARDS THAT END IF WE   LISTEN TO WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO TELL US IN WASHINGTON.  THANK YOU ALL AND GOD BLESS YOU.   >> PLEASE HELD ME WELCOME TO THE  STAGE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, KENDRA  BARTLET.  >> THANK YOU.  IT'S MY PRIVILEGE TODAY TO BE   ABLE TO INTRODUCE THE NEXT   SPEAKER. WHEN I WAS ASKED TO INTRODUCE REPRESENT GOMERT I CALLED OUR STATE DIRECTOR AND SAID, ANN, TELL ME ABOUT REPRESENTATIVE GO   MERT. SHE SAID HE'S A SWEETHEART.  BEING FROM TAXPAYER I KNOW THAT   MEANS WE REALLY LIKE HIM. REPRESENTATIVE GOMERT HAS   REPRESENTED THE FIRST DISTRICT   OF TEXAS SINCE THE YEAR 2005.  AND WE -- ONE THING YOU CAN ALWAYS SAY BY REPRESENTATIVE GOMERT IS HE WILL ALWAYS DO THE   RIGHT THING.  SO PLEASE WELCOME REPRESENTATIVE LEWIS GOMERT FROM THE FIRST   DISTRICT OF TEXAS.   >> THANK YOU. WOW, IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE WITH   YOU. I LOVE BEING AT FAITH AND   FREEDOM EVENT, YOU KNOW, RALPH   KEEPS HAVING ME.  I JUST TOLD HIM, I HOPE YOU GET   TO HAVE ONE NEXT YEAR AFTER I   FINISH SPEAKING.  WE GOT A LOT TO TALK ABOUT. DON'T YOU LOVE JEFF SESSIONS? WE'VE BEEN IN THE TRENCHES FIGHTING TOGETHER AND I LOVE   BEING IN THE TRENCHES FIGHTING   WITH HIM.  HE'S A GREAT, SMART MAN.  EVEN THOUGH HE DOES TALK WITH A SOUTHERN ACCENT.  AND AS JEFF FOXWORTHY SAID WHEN PEOPLE HEAR A SOUTHERN ACCENT   THEY IMMEDIATELY DEDUCT 50 IQ   POINTS FROM HOW SMART THEY THINK  YOU ARE. I GET THAT.  FROM SOME OF THE E-MAIL AND   NASTY MESSAGES I GET I THINK   THERE'S SOMETHING TO THAT.  HE MENTIONED JUSTICE SCALIA.  AREN'T WE GRATEFUL THAT GOD ALLOWED ANTONIN SCALIA TO BE ON   THE SUPREME COURT.  WHAT A BLESSING HE HAS BEEN. AND I CAN TELL YOU, I COUNTED HIM AS A FRIEND.  I HOPE HE FELT THAT WAY. BUT WHERE WE ARE IN THE COUNTRY   RIGHT NOW, WE DIDN'T DESERVE HIM.  HE WAS A MAN OF PRINCIPLE. BUT, OF COURSE, I LOVE BOTH HIS PRINSCIPLE PRINCIPLE, PLAIN SPOKENNESS AND   SENSE OF HUMOR. THERE WAS NO BETTER MEMORIES I'VE HAD, SOME UNPLEASANT ONES   IN WASHINGTON, THAN TO SIT DOWN   AT A MEAL WITH JUSTICE SCALIA   AND SWAP STORIES AND JOKES. HE LOVED GOOD JOKES, GOOD STORIES.  I TOLD ONE -- IT'S TOUGH WHEN   PEOPLE LIKE JOKES TO FIND ONE THEY HADN'T HEARD BEFORE.  ANYWAY, HE SAID HOW ABOUT THIS ONE, THIS PROBABLY HAPPENED BACK  DOWN IN TEXAS WHEN THEY USED HANGING.  HE SAID A DEFENDANT JUST THE   WORST OF THE WORST, HE MURDERED,  HE HAD DONE THE WORST, MOST DESPICABLE THINGS, BEEN SENTENCED TO HANG.  ON THAT SATURDAY MORNING THEY   BROUGHT HIM OUT, TWO OR THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE GATHERED TO SEE   IT.  THE SHERIFF BRINGS HIM UP ON THE GALLOWS AND SAYS WE HAVE A   TRADITION IN OUR TOWN BEFORE WE   HANG SOMEBODY, WE GIVE THEM A   CHANCE TO ADDRESS THE CROWD.  WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO THAT?  HE SAID, NO NOT REALLY. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND   YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO MEET THE   SUPREME COURT, THE SUPREME JUDGE YOUR MAKER. MOST PEOPLE THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO APOLOGIZE.  YOU HAVE VICTIM'S FAMILIES OUT   HERE. PEOPLE YOU'VE MURDERED AND HARMED.  DON'T YOU THINK YOU OUGHT TO   APOLOGIZE BEFORE YOU'RE HANGED. NOT REALLY.  >> WILL THE GENTLEMAN YIELD?  >> HE LOOKED AT THE SHERIFF AND   SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT   MEANS.  >> THE GUY THAT YELLED THAT THAT'S OUR LOCAL CONGRESSMAN. THAT'S CONGRESS TALK FOR YOU TO   GIVE HIM YOUR TIME TO SPEAK TO   THE CROWD.  HE SAID CAN I DO THAT.  THE SHERIFF SAID I GUESS YOU COULD.  HE SAID YEAH, I GUESS SO IF YOU HANG ME FIRST.  THAT WAS JUSTICE SCALIA.  WHAT A WONDERFUL MAN WHO CARED DEEPLY ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION.  I'M GOING TO GET TO SOMETHING   RIGHT NOW -- THIS APPARENTLY IS   WHAT I'M FAMOUS FOR AND IT   DRIVES THE LEFT NUTS.  BUT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT   SOMETHING THAT ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT.  AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A VERY   IMPORTANT ISSUE IS AFOOT AND   GOOD PEOPLE, SMART PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.  THEN THE WRONG PEOPLE GET THEIR WAYS AND THEY DO GREAT HARM TO   THIS NATION AND TO THE   INDIVIDUALS IN THIS NATION.  YOU'VE HEARD OF SOMETHING CALLED  TRANSGENDER. WE GOT TO TALK ABOUT IT.  OKAY? THIS IS NOT ME SPEAKING, YOU MAY  HAVE SEEN I BROUGHT A MANILA FOLDER.  I NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE.  I ALWAYS HAVE A LITTLE CARD THAT  HAS MY LITTLE OUTLINE AND I LOOK  DOWN AND REMINDS ME TO GET BACK   ON TRACK.  THIS TIME I'VE GOT ARTICLES HERE.  LIKE I SAY I'VE NOT DONE THIS BEFORE. BUT I WANTED YOU TO HEAR THIS   FROM WHAT ONE TRANSGENDER MAN   SAID IS THE LEADING EXPERT -- HE  SAID IN THE WORLD WHEN HE WAS TALKING TO ME.  I THINK HE'S THE BEST IN THE   WORLD. BUT HE WAS THE HEAD OF   PSYCHIATRY AT JOHNS HOPKINS MEDICAL FACILITY.  AND I VAGUELY REMEMBERED READING  SOMEWHERE THAT BACK IN THE 60s JOHNS HOPKINS WAS THE FIRST   HOSPITAL TO START DOING SEX CHANGE SURGERIES.  I READ THAT. MAYBE YOU HAVE.  BUT I DID NOT READ ANYWHERE   UNTIL WALT HIRE DIRECTED ME TO   DR. McHUGH'S ARTICLE IN WALL   STREET JOURNAL. THEY STOPPED DOING THIS YEARS AGO, THE SEX CHANGE.  LET ME TELL YOU WHAT DR. PAUL   McHUGH, HE'S NOW RETIRED AS THE   HEAD OF PSYCHIATRY, BUT HE STILL  ASSOCIATED WITH JOHNS HOPKINS.  THESE ARE HIS PROFESSIONAL   VIEWS. AND I WAS HOSTING POINT OF VIEW   JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS   FOR KIRBY ANDERSON AND I HAD DR.  McHUGH ON.  HIS ARTICLE, YOU CAN FIND THIS   ON WATT STREET JOURNAL,   MAY 13TH. HE SAID POLICYMAKERS AND THE   MEDIA ARE DOING NO FAVORS TO THE  PUBLIC OR TRANSGENDERED BY   TREATING THEIR CONFUSIONS AS A RIGHT AND NEED OF DEFENDING   RATHER THAN A MENTAL DISORDER THAT DESERVED UNDERSTANDING TREATMENT AND PREVENTION.  THIS --   YEAH.  THIS INTENSELY FELT SENSE OF BEING TRANSGENDERED INSTITUTES A MENTAL DISORDER INTO RESPECTS. THE FIRST IS THAT THE IDEA OF   SEX MISALIGNMENT IS SIMPLY MISTAKEN.  IT DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH   PHYSICAL REALITY. THE SECOND IS IT CAN LEAD TO   GRIM PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. HE SAYS THE TRANSGENDER SUFFER A DISORDER OF ASSUMPTION LIKE OTHER DISORDERS.  IT'S THAT THE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERS FROM WHAT SEEMS GIVEN IN NATURE.  ONE'S MALENESS OR FEMALENESS. OTHER KINDS OF DISORDER ASSUMPTIONS ARE HELD BY THOSE   WHO SUFFER FROM ANOREXIA OR BELUMIA.  WHERE IT'S THE BELIEF THAT THE DANGEROUSLY THIN OR OVERWEIGHT. HE GOES ON DISCUSSING THAT.  FOR THE TRANSGENDER, ONE FEELING OF GENDER IS A CONSCIOUS SUBJECTIVE SENSE THAT BEING IN ONE'S MIND CANNOT BE QUESTIONED   BY ANYONE ELSE. THE INDIVIDUAL OFTEN SEEKS NOT JUST SOCIETY'S TOLERANCE OF THIS  PERSONAL TRUTH, BUT AN AFFIRMATION OF IT.  HERE RESTS THE SUPPORT FOR TRANSGENDER EQUALITY.  THE DEMANDS FOR GOVERNMENT   PAYMENT FOR MEDICAL OR SURGICAL TREATMENTS AND ACCESS TO ALL SEX  BASED PUBLIC ROLES AND PRIVILEGES.  HE SAYS WITH THIS ARTICLE ADVOCATES FOR THE TRANSGENDERED HAVE PERSUADED SEVERAL STATES,   INCLUDING CALIFORNIA, NEW   JERSEY, MASSACHUSETTS TO PASS LAWS BARRING PSYCHIATRISTS, EVEN  WITH PARENTAL PERMISSION FROM   STRIVING TO RESTORE THE NATURAL   GENDER FEELINGS TO A TRANSGENDER  MINOR.  THE GOVERNMENT CAN INTRUDE INTO   PARENTS' RIGHTS TO SEEK HELP IN   GUIDING THEIR CHILDREN INDICATES  HOW POWERFUL THESE ADVOCATES   HAVE BECOME. NOW, HE IS SAYING THAT PSYCHIATRISTS MUST CHALLENGE   THIS AND HE MAKES THE GREAT   POINT I BROUGHT UP ON THE RADIO SHOW, WHAT AN INCREDIBLE IRONY   THAT STATES HAVE PASSED LAWS THAT SAY YOU CAN'T TAKE A CHILD TO A PSYCHIATRIST, PSYCHOLOGIST, COUNSELOR FOR WHAT IS ONLY IN   THEIR HEAD TO GET THEM HELP FOR   ONLY WHAT'S IN THEIR HEAD.  NO PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION.  AND AS HE SAYS HERE, THE ORDERS OF CONSCIOUSNESS REPRESENTS PSYCHIATRY'S DOMAIN.  DECLARING THEM OFF LIMITS WOULD ELIMINATE THE FIELD OF PSYCHIATRY. YOU GET THAT?  DOESN'T THAT MAKE SENSE?  HE SAYS YOU WON'T HEAR IT FROM THOSE CHAMPIONING TRANSGENDER EQUALITY BUT CONTROLLED AND   FOLLOW UP STUDIES REVEAL FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WITH THIS MOVEMENT. WHEN CHILDREN WHO REPORTED TRANSGENDER FEELINGS WERE   TRACKED WITHOUT MEDICAL OR   SURGICAL TREATMENT AT BOTH   VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY AND   LONDON'S PORTMAN CLINIC, 70% TO 08  80% OF THOSE LOST THOSE FEELINGS.  20% DID HAVE PERSISTENT FEELING. WHAT DIFFREFERENCE 80S THOSE INDIVIDUALS REMAINS TO BE DISCERNED.  THINK OF THE DAMAGE WE'RE DOING   TO KIDS. NOT JUST THE POOR GIRLS OR WOMEN THAT HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSED, HAVING A MAN WALK INTO THEM IN   THEIR MOST IMPORTANT PRIVACY.  THAT'S ABOUT ENOUGH.  BUT WHAT ABOUT THE DAMAGE TO THE LITTLE CHILD THAT IS CONFUSED   AND WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HELP THAT CONFUSED CHILD. HE POINTS OUT THAT 2011 STUDY AT THE INSTITUTE IN SWEDEN PRODUCED  THE MOST ELIMINATING RESULTS YET  REGARDING THE TRANSGENDER.  EVIDENCE THAT COULD GIVE ADVOCATES PAUSE, UNFORTUNATELY, IT HASN'T.  BUT HE SAYS THE STUDY UP TO 30 YEARS FOLLOWED 324 PEOPLE WHO   HAD SEX REASSIGNMENT SURGERY, THE STUDY REVEALED BEGINNING ABOUT TEN YEARS AFTER THE SURGERY, THE TRANSGENDER BEGAN   TO EXPERIENCE INCREASING MENTAL DIFFICULTIES, MOST SHOCKINGLY   THEIR SUICIDE MORTALITY ROSE 20   FOLD ABOVE THE COMPARABLE NON-TRANSGENDER POPULATION. THIS DISTURBING RESULT HAS YET NO EXPLANATION BUT PROBABLY   REFLECTS THE GROWING SENSE OF ISOLATION REPORTED BY THE AGING TRANSGENDERED AFTER SURGERY.  THE HIGH SUICIDE RATE CERTAINLY CHALLENGES THE SURGERY PRESCRIPTION.  I DIDN'T READ THIS BUT IT TURNS   OUT JOHNS HOPKINS, THE FIRST HOSPITAL IN AMERICA TO DO SEX CHANGE SURGERY QUIT DOING IT YEARS AGO.  BECAUSE THEY FOUND WE'RE NOT HELPING AND WE'RE PROBABLY HURTING SO WE SHOULD NOT -- AS   THEY'VE SAID BE CUTTING UP NORMAL ORGANS. THIS IS SERIOUS AND I KNOW IT'S UNPLEASANT TO TALK ABOUT.  THAT'S WHY SO OFTEN WE LOSE.  PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF BEING   CALLED CRAZY OR PHOBIC OF SOME   KIND. Y'ALL, I HAVE ONE PHOBIA.  AND THAT'S A GOD PHOBIA.  I HAVE A FEAR OF GOD AND WE'RE   TOLD THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF   WISDOM. I GOT A LONG WAY TO GO, BUT THAT'S THE BEGINNING,   HE FINISHES HIS ARTICLE.  HE SAYS AT THE HEART OF THE   PROBLEM IS CONFUSION OVER THE   NATURE OF THE TRANSGENDER SEX   CHANGE IS BIOLOGICALLY IS IMPOSSIBLE.  THIS IS THE GUY THAT KNOWS MORE   ABOUT TRANSGENDER. HE'S SAYING SEX CHANGE IS BIOLOGICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. PEOPLE WHO UNDERGO REASSIGNMENT SURGERY DO NOT CHANGE FROM MEN TO WOMEN OR VICE VERSA.  THEY BECOME FEMINIZED MEN OR MASCULINIZED WOMEN CLAIMING THIS IS CIVIL RIGHTS MAT ARAND   ENCOURAGING SURGICAL INTERVENTION IS PROMOTING A MENTAL DISORDER.  I SAID WELL THE NEW DSM-V THE   MANUAL THAT OVER THE YEARS IT CHANGES AND EVOLVES AND IT HAS WHAT IS THE ACCEPTED DIAGNOSIS THAT A PHYSICIAN CAN PRESCRIBE OR LIST.  AND THEY'VE CHANGED THIS MENTAL DISORDER, TRANSGENDER TO THE   TERM TRANSGENDER DYSPHORIA.  AND DR. McHUGH SAID ON THE RADIO WITH ME HE SAID THAT DYSPHORIA   MAY BE MORE DESCRIPTIVE. IT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE A GENERAL FEELING OF DISSATISFACTION WITH   SOMETHING, IN THIS CASE BEING WITH YOUR FEMALE OR MASCULINE GENDER.  IT'S A GENERALIZED SENSE OF DISSATISFACTION.  AND FOR THAT YOU WANT TO CUT OFF  ORGANS AND DESTROY PEOPLE'S LIVES?  AND NOW THIS ADMINISTRATION SAYS  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE VA DO   SEX CHANGE OPERATIONS.  REALLY? DO WE NOT HAVE ENOUGH VETERANS COMMITTING SUICIDE WITHOUT YOU INCREASING THAT 20 TIMES?  ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.  AND WE HAVE TO STAND UP FOR OUR VETERANS.  WE'RE THE HUH DLTSADULTS. WE HAVE TO STAND UP FOR OUR CHILDREN. LET ME GIVE YOU THIS LAST FINAL STORY.  WOW, EVEN WHEN HE WAS A JUDGE HE MADE INTERNATIONAL HEADLINES. I HAD A GUY COME BEFORE ME FOR   STEALING A CAR. I WAS A FELONY JUDGE. THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAD MADE THAT A MANDATORY PROBATION. I LOOK AT THIS GUY'S -- HE'S GOT  THIS LONG RAP SHEET, ALL OF THIS CONVICTIONS.  I WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN HIM PROBASISPROBE PROBATION BUT THAT WAS MANDATED. I GET TO SET THE TERMS OF CONDITION. I COULDN'T BRING THIS UP BUT HIS  LAWYER BROUGHT IT UP FIRST THAT MY CLIENT HAS AIDS SO WE WANT TO  MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU SEND HIM   TO SUBSSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT   THAT HE GETS THIS MEDICATION   THAT KEEPS HIM ALIVE.  I SAID I UNDERSTAND THE STATE   WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT.  ONE OF MY JOBS IS TO MAKE SURE   WITH THE CONDITIONS OF PROBATION  THAT I PROTECT THE PUBLIC SAFETY. AND IT HAS OCCURRED TO ME THAT.   WHEN YOU GO FOR SURGERY A DOCTOR  HAS TO BY LAW GIVE YOU ALL THE RISKS OF WHICH THEY'RE AWARE OF THE SURGERY.  AND THEN ONCE YOU'VE BEEN   INFORMED OF ALL THE RISKS YOU HAVE TO SIGN A STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT THAT YOU   UNDERSTAND THOSE RISKS AND YOU   WISH TO GO AHEAD WITH THE SURGERY.  OTHERWISE, THE DOCTOR IS LIABLE TO YOU.  I SAID I GOT TO THINKING ABOUT THIS AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU GOT THE HIV VIRUS AND   FOR OUR PURPOSES, IT DOESN'T MATTER.  BUT I BET WHEN YOU BECAME HIV POSITIVE YOU WISHED THE PERSON   THAT GAVE IT TO YOU HAD TOLD YOU ABOUT THE RISKS INHERENT TO   HAVING SEXUAL RELATIONS. AND SO HERE'S ONE OF YOUR   CONDITIONS OF PROBATION. YOU WILL NOT HAVE SEXUAL   RELATIONS WITH ANYONE UNLESS YOU FIRST ADVISE THEM IN WRITING   THAT YOU HAVE AIDS, THAT THEY   COULD GET IT AND THEY COULD DIE.  DOESN'T THAT SOUND FAIR? HE NODDED, YEAH, THAT SEEMED FAIR.  AND EVERYBODY THOUGHT THAT SEEMED FAIR. AND THEN WE HAD ALL OF THESE GAY RIGHTS GROUPS CAME AFTER ME,   GRIEVANCES FILED, ACLU FILED AN APPEAL, ALL THIS STUFF. IT MADE INTERNATIONAL NEWS.  WHICH IS HOW I FOUND OUT ABOUT GOMERT RELATIVE IN EUROPE.  ANYWAY, THEY READ ABOUT ME IN A   EUROPEAN NEWSPAPER.  ANYWAY, SO I HAD JUDGES ACROSS TEXAS SAY, WOW, THAT WAS REALLY   SMART.  I LOVE WHAT YOU DID.  I SAID OH, YOU WANT THE FORMS? ARE YOU CRAZY I DON'T WANT THE   GRIEF YOU'VE BEEN GETTING.  ANYWAY, THAT WAS I BELIEVE IN 1994.  NOW MOST STATES HAVE MADE IT A CRIME IF YOU KNOWINGLY -- IF YOU  HAVE AIDS AND YOU KNOWINGLY   EXPOSE OTHER PEOPLE TO THAT.  SOMEBODY HAD TO STAND UP AT THE   BEGINNING AND BE CALLED CRAZY   AND A HOMEPHOBE. WHEN ALL I WAS DOING WAS CARING   ABOUT PEOPLE.  WE'VE GOT TO DO THE SAME THING.  THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.  THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT HOPE.  WE KNOW THE CREATOR AND WE KNOW THE SOURCE OF OUR STRENGTH.  MY TIME IS UP. BUT YOUR TIME IS NOT.  LET'S STAND TOGETHER AND MAKE   OUR VOICES HEARD.  THANK YOU, GOD BLESS YOU.    OKAY.  YOU MAY TAKE YOUR SEATS.  I WANT TO THANK IN ADDITION TO   ALL OF THE PLATINUM AND GOLD   SPONSORS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER, OUR GREATLY VALUED   PARTNER ON ROAD TO MAJORITY, CONCERNED WOMEN FOR AMERICA, AND  I WANT TO GIVE -- I WANT TO GIVE  A SPECIAL SHOUTOUT, I DON'T KNOW  WHERE SHE IS, TO PENNY NANCE,   THEIR CEO AND PRESIDENT.  PENNY, ARE YOU HERE? I SEE YOU.  AND I FRANKLY AM AFRAID IT MAY BE SOLD OUT, BUT THERE MAY BE A   FEW TICKETS LEFT. I REALLY DON'T KNOW, BUT IF   YOU'RE GOING TO BE HERE TOMORROW, I REALLY URGE YOU TO   STAY FOR TOMORROW NIGHT'S GALA   BANQUET WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE   GIVING OUR LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD TO THE FOUNDER OF CONCERNED WOMEN FOR AMERICA, MRS. BEVERLY LEHEY.  WE NAMED THAT AWARD THE WINSTON   CHURCHILL AWARD, BUT TWO OF THE   FIRST THREE WINNERS HAVE BEEN WOMEN, SO WE MAY RENAME IT THE MARGARET THATCHER LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD. WELL, WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ADO, IT'S MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE A MAN WHO HAS BECOME A GOOD   FRIEND, DONALD TRUMP WAS BORN IN  1946 IN QUEENS, NEW YORK.  HE'S THE SON OF A BUILDER AND   REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER WHO   GRADUATED FROM THE WHARTON SCHOOL OF BUSINESS IN 1968. FOLLOWING HIS GRADUATION, HE   ENTERED THE FAMILY BUSINESS AND WITHIN A DECADE, HE HAD LAUNCHED  THE FIRST OF MANY HISTORIC PROJECTS THAT HAVE LITERALLY TRANSFORMED MUCH OF MID-TOWN MANHATTAN. HE SUBSEQUENTLY EXPANDED HIS PROJECTS TO NEW JERSEY AND LATER FLORIDA, AND OVER THESE LAST 20   YEARS, HE HAS BUILT NOT ONLY ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PRIVATELY  HELD COMPANIES IN THE WORLD, BUT  ALSO ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC BRANDS OF OUR TIME.  TODAY, HIS PROPERTIES ARE   LITERALLY FOUND ON VIRTUALLY EVERY CONTINENT IN THE WORLD.  INCLUDING THE TURNBERRY GOLF RESORT IN SCOTLAND AND MANY OTHERS.  IT'S NOW, BY THE WAY, THE TRUMP TURNBERRY GOLF RESORT. IN 1987, HE WROTE THE ART OF THE  DEAL. ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS BOOKS IN THE HISTORY OF  PUBLISHING. SELLING OVER A MILLION HARDCOVER  COPIES, AND THE BOOK REMAINED ON  THE ""NEW YORK TIMES"" BEST SELLER  LIST FOR A RECORD 51 WEEKS. IN 2004, HE BEGAN HIS MORE THAN DECADE LONG TENURE AS BOTH THE STAR AND EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF NBC'S HIGHLY RATED SUNDAY EVENING SNOW ""THE APPRENTICE.""  IT REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PRIMETIME PROGRAMS IN  HISTORY.  AND IT HAS BECOME SO SUCCESSFUL   THAT HE HAS SOUGHT TO TRADEMARK THE PHRASE ""YOU'RE FIRED.""  A PHRASE THAT WE HOPE IS USED A LOT IN WASHINGTON BEGINNING IN JANUARY OF 2017. A LITTLE LESS THAN A YEAR AGO, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS LOVELY WIFE MELANIA, HE RODE THE ESCALATOR   DOWN INTO THE LOBBY OF THE TRUMP TOWER AND ANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDACY FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.  AND IN THE RECENTLY COMPLETED PRIMARIES, HE RECEIVED MORE VOTES THAN ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN THE HISTORY OF THE   REPUBLICAN PARTY.  NOW, MANY MAY NOT KNOW THIS, BUT DONALD TRUMP IS NO STRANGER TO FAITH AND FREEDOM OR TO THIS   ORGANIZATION.  THIS IS ACTUALLY HIS THIRD   APPEARANCE AT THIS CONFERENCE.  AND NOT WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, I MIGHT ADD. AND WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE HIM BACK. PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING ONE   OF THE WORLD'S GREAT BUSINESS LEADERS, A BEST-SELLING AUTHOR,   AND ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST REMARKABLE ENTREPRENEURS AND NOW  POLITICAL FIGURES, THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT, DONALD J. TRUMP.  >> THANK YOU. WOW. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. WOW, WHAT A GROUP. SO MANY LIGHTS. SO MANY LIGHTS.  THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.  WHAT AN HONOR.  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BIG, BIG VICTORY IN NOVEMBER. YOU'RE GOING TO BE VERY HAPPY,   BELIEVE ME.  THANK YOU.  RALPH IS RIGHT.  THIS IS MY THIRD TIME, AND I   THINK THE FIRST TIME IT WAS ONLY  OKAY.  THE SECOND TIME, I WAS GREAT.  AND THIS TIME, WE HAVE TO TOP   IT. OKAY?  THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE.  BEFORE WE BEGIN, REALLY, I WANT TO THANK RALPH REED.  HE'S BEEN JUST AN AMAZING GUY, AND AMAZING SUPPORT.  TERRIFIC MAN, AND IT'S A GREAT   HONOR TO BE INVITED, AND INVITED BACK SO MANY TIMES. AND I'LL BE HERE AS OFTEN AS I CAN, BELIEVE ME, BECAUSE I'M WITH YOU 100%. I ALSO WANT TO THANK SO MANY --   I HAVE HAD SO MUCH SUPPORT.  AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE DONE VERY   WELL WITH THE EVANGELICALS AND   WITH RELIGION GENERALLY SPEAKING, IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S   HAPPENED WITH ALL OF THE RACES, WHETHER IT'S IN SOUTH CAROLINA,   I WENT THERE AND IT WAS SUPPOSED  TO BE STRONG EVANGELICAL, AND I   WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO WIN AND I WON IN A LANDSLIDE, AND SO MANY OTHER PLACES WHERE YOU HAD THE EVANGELICALS AND YOU HAD THE   HEAVY CHRISTIAN GROUPS AND IT WAS JUST -- IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING  JOURNEY TO HAVE -- I THINK WE WON 37 DIFFERENT STATES. AND THE SUPPORT THAT I HAVE HAD   FROM YOU FOLKS HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE.  AND I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH.  I HAPPEN TO BE -- GO AHEAD.  I HAPPEN TO BE PRESBYTERIAN, AND  THERE'S ABOUT THREE OF YOU OUT   THERE, I THINK. BUT IT'S BEEN REALLY SOMETHING. AND SOME OF MY FRIENDS THAT ARE   IN THE ROOM, I APPRECIATE YOU   BEING HERE.  I WANT TO REALLY THANK JERRY FALWELL JR., RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, HE'S BEEN SUCH A TREMENDOUS SUPPORTER.  AS YOU KNOW, LIBERTY UNIVERSITY, THE JOB HE'S DONE IS INCREDIBLE. PASTOR PAULA WHITE HAS BEEN   RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, I HAVE  KNOWN HER FOR SO LONG AND SHE'S A TREMENDOUS PERSON, TREMENDOUS   WOMAN. PASTOR MARK BURNS.  I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE WATCHED HIM ON TELEVISION, BETWEEN HIM AND PASTOR DARELL SCOTT, THESE   TWO GUYS ARE PHENOMENAL. THEY HAVE BEEN SO INCREDIBLE.  ROBERT JEFFERS, WHO WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE.  HE'S BEEN AMAZING, AND IN THE AUDIENCE, I THINK WE HAVE   RICHARD LEE. WE HAVE JIM GARLO, AND FATHER FRANK PAVONE. SOMEPLACE THEY'RE IN THE AUDIENCE.  I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE.  I HAVE TO SAY, THOUGH, THE WORLD IS SUCH A DIFFERENT PLACE.  EVEN FROM WHEN I STARTED WITH THIS.  WE STARTED 12 MONTHS AGO, AND COMING UP, I JUST SEE WHERE IN FRANCE, THEY HAVE A MASSIVE   SOCCER TOURNAMENT, SOMETHING   THAT'S SO IMPORTANT AND SO BIG. AND THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT MAYBE  POSTPONING IT OR CANCELLING IT BECAUSE OF THREATS AND ALL THE   PROBLEMS GOING ON WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH TERRORISM. AND IT'S A VERY, VERY SAD THING,  AND A VERY SAD PLACE. AND WHO WOULD HAVE EVER THOUGHT   OUR WORLD WOULD BE IN A POSITION LIKE THIS, WHERE THAT WOULD HAPPEN, BUT YOU SEE EVENT AFTER EVENT, RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM  IS JUST, YOU KNOW, TAKING OVER. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.  WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN.  AND IF WE'RE SMART, AND IF WE'RE TOUGH, WE WON'T LET IT HAPPEN.  JUST REMEMBER THAT. OKAY.  IT'S AN HONOR TO SPEAK HERE   TODAY AND DISCUSS OUR SHARED VALUES.  I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL OF THE  WONDERFUL CHRISTIAN LEADERS AND   CHRISTIAN VOTERS WHO HAVE SUPPORTED ME.  WE HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS SUPPORT.  HERE WE ARE, AND HERE ARE THE GOALS, AND I THOUGHT I WOULD PUT  SOME OF THESE TOGETHER, AND I   DID IT JUST THE OTHER NIGHT BECAUSE OF THIS MEETING.  AND I WANTED IT TO COME FROM ME,  FROM MY HEART.  WE WANT TO UPHOLD THE SANCTITY AND DIGNITY OF LIFE.  MARRIAGE AND FAMILY AS THE   BUILDING BLOCK OF HAPPINESS AND SUCCESS. AND BY THE WAY, I KNOW MANY,   MANY VERY SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE, THE  HAPPIEST PEOPLE ARE THE PEOPLE   WHO HAVE THAT GREAT RELIGIOUS   FEEL AND THAT INCREDIBLE MARRIAGE.  CHILDREN. IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE MONEY, FOLKS, BELIEVE ME.  I KNOW PLENTY WITH LOTS OF MONEY AND THEY'RE NOT HAPPY PEOPLE.  RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, THE RIGHT OF   PEOPLE OF FAITH TO FREELY PRACTICE THEIR FAITH, SO   IMPORTANT. FREEDOM OF ANY KIND MEANS NO ONE  SHOULD BE JUDGED BY THEIR RACE   OR THEIR COLOR AND THE COLOR OF   THEIR SKIN SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED   THAT WAY.  AND RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE A VERY DIVIDED NATION.  WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUR NATION   TOGETHER.  IF I WIN, WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUR NATION TOGETHER.  THE IMPORTANCE OF FAITH TO   UNITED STATES SOCIETY, IT'S   REALLY THE PEOPLE WHO GO TO CHURCH, WHO WORK AND WORK IN RELIGIOUS CHARITIES, SO IMPORTANT.  AND SHARE THEIR VALUES.  THESE ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR SOCIETY.  WE MUST CONTINUE TO FORGE OUR   PARTNERSHIP WITH ISRAEL AND WORK  TO INSURE ISRAEL'S SECURITY.  KEEPING PEOPLE OF FAITH SAFE FROM THREATS LIKE RADICAL ISLAM, WHETHER PROTECTING THEM HERE OR   STANDING BY ISRAEL, ALL OF US NEED TO CONFRONT TOGETHER THE   THREAT OF RADICAL ISLAM.  WE HAVE TO DO IT.  NOW, HILLARY CLINTON OR AS I   CALL HER, CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON  CLINTON, CROOKED AS THEY COME,   REFUSES TO EVEN SAY THE WORDS RADICAL ISLAM.  REFUSES TO SAY THE WORDS.  THIS ALONE MAKES HER UNFIT TO BE PRESIDENT. IN FACT, --   IN FACT, SHE WANTS A 500% INCREASE IN SYRIAN REFUGEES TO   COME INTO OUR COUNTRY.  NO GOOD.  NO GOOD.  NO GOOD.  CAN'T DO IT.  WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM.  WHERE THEY ARE.   >> ALL RIGHT.  THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT.  A LITTLE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. FREEDOM OF SPEECH.  THANK YOU.  VERY RUDE, BUT WHAT ARE YOU   GOING TO DO?  THANK YOU.  APPRECIATE IT. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY IS SO SAD.  WE'RE SO DIVIDED.  IT'S SUCH A SHAME.  BY THE WAY, THESE ARE PROFESSIONAL AGITATORS. THEY COME IN, THEY'RE SENT LEER BY HERE BY THE OTHER PARTY, BELIEVE ME.  WHERE WE LEFT OFF.  500% INCREASE IN SYRIAN REFUGEES.  WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION, WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM.  HILLARY WILL BRING HUNDREDS OF   THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES, MANY OF WHOM HAVE POSSIBLE BELIEFS ABOUT  PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT FAITHS AND   VALUES, AND SOME OF WHOM ABSOLUTELY AND OPENLY SUPPORT TERRORISM IN OUR COUNTRY.  WE DON'T NEED THAT. WE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS.  WE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW.  HERE IS SOME OF WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH TOGETHER.  APPOINT JUDGES, SO IMPORTANT.  SO IMPORTANT. WHO WILL UPHOLD OUR LAWS,   PROTECT OUR CONSTITUTION, AND   PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF ALL AMERICANS. AND AS YOU KNOW, I PUT A LIST TOGETHER OF HIGHLY, HIGHLY RESPECTED JUDGES, AND YOU WILL SEE, AND I THINK YOU HAVE SEEN IT, AND I'M PRETTY SURE YOU DID,  BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE REALLY   COME TOGETHER OVER THAT LIST.  THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT  REASONS WHY WE HAVE TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY. IF WE DON'T, IT'S GOING TO BE A   WHOLE DIFFERENT COUNTRY.  AND BY THE WAY, THESE JUDGES ARE ALL PRO-LIFE.  WE WILL RESTORE RESPECT FOR PEOPLE OF FAITH WHO DUTIFULLY RAISE THEIR CHILDREN TO FOLLOW   OUR LAWS AND RULES, AND WE HAVE   TO REALLY TAKE CARE OF -- WE   HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR NEIGHBORS. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, OUR NEIGHBORS  ARE NOT BEING TAKEN CARE OF.  WE HAVE TO RESTORE THE RULE OF   LAW ON OUR BORDER, IN OUR GOVERNMENT, NO MATTER WHERE IT   IS.  IT HAS TO BE RESTORED. AND BY THE WAY, WE HAVE TO PAY   GREAT RESPECT TO OUR POLICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY.  BELIEVE ME.  THEY'RE NOT BEING TREATED PROPERLY.  SO ALL OF THIS INCLUDES TOUGH NEW ETHICS RULES TO RESTORE DIGNITY TO THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE. WHICH IT HASN'T HAD IN A WHILE, FOLKS.  AMONG BEING THE WORST DEAL MAKERS I HAVE EVER SEEN, IF YOU   LOOK AT THE IRAN DEAL, TRULY ONE  OF THE WORST DEALS I HAVE EVER SEEN NEGOTIATED. WE WILL PROTECT THE RIGHT OF CHURCHES TO SPEAK THEIR MINDS ON POLITICAL MATTERS, FREE FROM INTIMIDATION. NEW IMMIGRATION CONTROLS TO KEEP US SAFE FROM RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. HERE IS WHAT HILLARY CLINTON   WOULD DO TO OUR COUNTRY.  SHE'LL APPOINT RADICAL JUDGES   WHO WILL LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH, OVERRIDING CONGRESS, AND   I TELL YOU, THE WILL OF THE   PEOPLE WILL MEAN NOTHING, NOTHING. HER JUDGES WILL ABOLISH THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND DESTROY THE RULE OF LAW.  SHE WANTS TO ABOLISH THE SECOND   AMENDMENT. AND I WILL TELL YOU, THE   NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION, THE NRA, TWO WEEKS AGO ENDORSED   DONALD TRUMP.  SO I THINK YOU'RE HAPPY ABOUT THAT.  AND I THINK IT'S THE EARLIEST   ENDORSEMENT THEY HAVE EVER GIVEN  TO A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, SO   I WAS VERY HONORED. THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE. GREAT PEOPLE.  SHE WILL KEEP OBAMACARE IN   PLACE, WHICH PUTS MEDICAL DECISIONS IN THE HANDS OF   GOVERNMENT. NOT GOOD.  OBAMACARE, WE WILL REPEAL AND REPLACE.  SHE'LL RESTRICT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM WITH GOVERNMENT MANDATES.  SHE'LL PUSH FOR FEDERAL FUNDING OF ABORTION ON DEMAND UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH, WHICH IS WHERE SHE IS, AS YOU KNOW. SHE WILL UNDERMINE THE WAGES OF WORKING PEOPLE WITH UNCONTROLLED IMMIGRATION, CREATING POVERTY   AND INCOME INSECURITY.  HILLARY CLINTON'S WALL STREET AGENDA WILL CRUSH WORKING FAMILIES.  SHE'LL PUT BUREAUCRATS, NOT   PARENTS, IN CHARGE OF OUR LIVES, AND OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION. CAN'T HAVE IT.  SHE'LL BE TRAPPING KIDS IN   FAILING SCHOOLS.  SHE'LL PLUNGE OUR INNER CITIES INTO EVEN DEEPER POVERTY IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.  HILLARY'S AGENDA OF TAXATION, AND SHE WANTS TO RAISE YOUR   TAXES BIG LEAGUE, FOLKS, BIG LEAGUE.  GET USED TO IT.  HEAR IT.  SHE WANTS TO RAISE YOUR TAXES TREMENDOUSLY.  REGULATION, BUREAUCRACY, GOVERNMENT CONTROL, AND OPEN   BORDERS HAVE ECONOMICALLY DESTROYED OUR INNER CITIES.  HER POLICIES WILL BE A CRUSHING   BLOW TO ALL POOR PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. HER EDUCATION POLICIES, HER ECONOMIC POLICIES, HER IMMIGRATION POLICIES, AND HER TRADE POLICIES WILL PLUNGE OUR POOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND   HISPANIC COMMUNITIES INTO   TURMOIL AND EVEN WORSE, DESPAIR. BELIEVE ME, IF YOU LOOK AT   WHAT'S GOING ON.  THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS RUN THE   SCHOOL BOARDS AND THE POLICE   DEPARTMENTS AND THE CITY   COUNCILS AND THE MAYOR'S OFFICES  IN MOST OF OUR INNER CITIES,   ALMOST ALL OF OUR INNER CITIES. THEY HAVE RUN CONGRESSIONAL OFFICES.  THEY HAVE HORRIBLY FAILED IN   ALMOST EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY.  IN FACT, YOU COULD ACTUALLY SAY IN EVERY COMMUNITY. I'M GOING TO TURN THINGS AROUND.  HILLARY CLINTON HAS JEOPARDIZED,  TOTALLY JEOPARDIZED NATIONAL   SECURITY BY PUTTING HER E-MAILS   ON A PRIVATE SERVER, ALL TO HIDE  HER CORRUPT DEALINGS.  THIS IS THE REASON SHE DID IT, FOLKS.  IT'S TO HIDE HER CORRUPT   DEALINGS. SHE'S NOW UNDER CRIMINAL   INVESTIGATION. THAT WAS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY  BY   THE WHITE HOUSE. I MEAN, IT'S CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. FIRST TIME EVER, BY THE WAY, A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES   ENDORSED SOMEBODY UNDER CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. INTERESTING.  SHE EVEN APPOINTED TO THE   NATIONAL SECURITY BOARD SOMEONE WITH NO NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERIENCE, INSTEAD, HE WAS A DONOR.  A RECENT DONOR TO HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN. AND ALSO GAVE AS MUCH AS  $250,000 TO A FOUNDATION.  THEY ALL LOOKED AND SAID WHERE   DOES THIS GUY COME FROM?  HE MADE A CONTRIBUTION OF  $250,000. ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE'S ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT AND VITAL BOARD. THIS POSITION DEALT WITH   TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND HAD  TOP-SECRET CLEARANCE.  AND HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT.  BILL AND HILLARY MADE $153 MILLION GIVING SPEECHES TO   SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS SINCE   2001.  THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.  THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. THESE DONORS OWN HILLARY   CLINTON.  THEY OWN HER.  AND BERNIE SANDERS WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT.  I HAVE TO TELL YOU.  IF YOU WORK -- IT'S TRUE.  AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS I WILL BE  WORKING FOR YOU. I JUST SPENT $55 MILLION RUNNING  OF MY MONEY. I DON'T KNOW.  NOT EASY, BUT I JUST SPENT $55   MILLION OF MY MONEY RUNNING IN THE PRIMARIES. OTHER PEOPLE SPENT MANY TIMES THAT AMOUNT, AND THEY DIDN'T DO SO WELL.  OKAY.  BUT I WORK FOR YOU.  I'M WORKING FOR YOU. I'M DOING THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO  PUT BACK, I WANT TO GIVE BACK, I WANT TO GIVE BACK TO OUR COUNTRY. TOGETHER, FRIENDS, WE WILL CHART  A NEW OPTIMISTIC COURSE FOR AMERICA. WE WILL PUT AMERICA FIRST.  WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR DEALS, OUR MILITARY DEALS, OUR TRADE DEALS,  WE DON'T PUT AMERICA FIRST.  I DON'T THINK ANYBODY   NEGOTIATING THESE DEALS EVEN   KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND I DON'T THINK   THEY CARE ABOUT AMERICA BEING FIRST.  I CARE, AND YOU CARE, AND THAT'S  THE WAY IT'S GOING TO BE.  AND THAT'S A BIG, BIG PART OF   WHY I'M CHALLENGING HILLARY   CLINTON TODAY, TO REPLACE HER   SUPPORT FOR INCREASED REFUGEE ADMISSIONS, WE HAVE TO DO IT, FOR A NEW JOBS PROGRAM FOR OUR   INNER CITIES.  WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE   PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE.  WE HAVE TO TEMPORARILY STOP THIS  WHOLE THING WITH WHAT'S GOING ON WITH REFUGEES.  WHERE WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM.  BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE A REST, WE   HAVE TO TAKE A TIME-OUT. WE HAVE TO USE THE MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF OUR POOREST AMERICANS   AND WORK WITH THEM SO THEY CAN COME OUT OF THIS HORRIBLE   SITUATION THAT THEY'RE IN.  WE WILL RESTORE FAITH TO ITS   PROPER MANTLE IN OUR SOCIETY.  THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. AND WE HAVE TO DO THAT SOON.  WE WILL RESPECT AND DEFEND CHRISTIAN AMERICANS.  CHRISTIAN AMERICANS. WE WILL GIVE PARENTS CONTROL OVER THEIR SCHOOLS.  SO IMPORTANT.  WE'LL UPHOLD THE VALUES OUR FOUNDERS GAVE US, WHICH WE'RE   NOT DOING NOW.  WE WILL WORK TOGETHER TO REBUILD AND RESTORE AND LIFT UP   EVERYONE, NOT A CERTAIN GROUP,   EVERYONE. THE WHOLE GROUP.  WE'RE GOING TO LIFT UP.  WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN  FOR ALL AMERICANS.  AND WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER.  I WANT TO THANK YOU.  THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT HONOR.  AMAZING FRIENDSHIPS I HAVE IN   THIS ROOM.  THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE IT.  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  THANK YOU.  THANK  YOU.  THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.",Faith and Freedom Coalition Conference

SO MANY PEOPLE, I MEAN, JUST HARD TO BELIEVE BUT JUST SO MANY PEOPLE DEAD, SO MANY PEOPLE GRAVELY INJURED, SO MUCH CARNAGE, SUCH A DISGRACE. THE HORROR IS BEYOND DESCRIPTION. THE FAMILIES OF THESE WONDERFUL PEOPLE ARE TOTALLY DEVASTATED AND THEY WILL BE FOREVER. LIKEWISE OUR WHOLE NATION AND, INDEED, THE WHOLE WORLD IS DEVASTATED. WE EXPRESS OUR DEEPEST SYMPATHIES TO THE VICTIMS, THE WOUNDED AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE MOURN AS ONE PEOPLE FOR OUR NATION'S LOSS AND PLEDGE OUR SUPPORT TO ANY AND ALL WHO NEED IT. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK NOW THAT WE ALL OBSERVE A MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR THE VICTIMS OF THIS ATTACK.   >> THANK YOU. OUR NATION STANDS TOGETHER IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE MEMBERS OF ORLANDO'S LGBT COMMUNITY. THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH SOMETHING THAT NOBODY COULD EVER EXPERIENCE. THIS IS A VERY DARK MOMENT IN AMERICA'S HISTORY. A RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST TARGETED THE NIGHTCLUB NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE WE WANTED TO KILL AMERICANS BUT IN ORDER TO EXECUTE GAY AND LESBIAN CITIZENS BECAUSE OF THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION, IT'S A STRIKE OF THE HEART AND SOUL OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. ABILITY OF FREE PEOPLE TO LIVE THEIR LIVES, LOVE WHO THEY WANT AND EXPRESS THEIR IDENTITY. IT'S AN ATTACK ON THE RIGHT OF EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN TO LIVE IN PEACE AND SAFETY IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY. WE NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ATTACK IN AMERICA AS ONE UNITED PEOPLE WITH FORCE, PURPOSE AND DETERMINATION. BUT THE CURRENT POLITICALLY CORRECT RESPONSE CRIPPLES OUR ABILITY TO TALK AND TO THINK AND ACT CLEARLY. WE ARE NOT ACTING CLEARLY, WE ARE NOT TALKING CLEARLY, WE'VE GOT PROBLEMS. IF WE DON'T GET TOUGH AND IF WE DON'T GET SMART AND FAST, WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE OUR COUNTRY ANYMORE. THERE WILL BE NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LEFT. THE KILLER WHOSE NAME I WILL NOT USE OR EVER SAY WAS BORN IN AFGHAN -- OF AFGHAN PARENTS WHO IMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES. REGIME WHICH MURDERS THOSE WHO DON'T SHARE ITS CAD RAL VIEWS AND THEY MURDERED PLENTY. THE FATHER EVEN SAID HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN. THE BOTTOM LINE THAT THE KILLER WAS IN AMERICA IN THE FIRST PLACE IS BECAUSE WE ALLOWED HIS FAMILY TO COME HERE. THAT IS A FACT AND THAT'S A FACT THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT. WE HAVE A DYSFUNCTIONAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM WHICH DOES NOT PERMIT US TO KNOW WHO WE LET IN THE COUNTRY AND DOES NOT PERMIT TO PROTECT OUR CITIZENS PROPERLY. WE HAVE AN INCOMPETENT ADMINISTRATION AND IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT, THAT WILL NOT CHANGE, I WILL TELL YOU, THAT WILL NOT CHANGE OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. WE HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION THAT WILL NOT CHANGE, BUT IF I GET IN THERE, IT'S GOING TO CHANGE AND IT'S GOING TO CHANGE QUICKLY. WE ARE GOING FROM TOTALLY INCOMPETENT TO JUST THE OPPOSITE, BELIEVE ME.   >> THANK YOU. WITH 50 PEOPLE DEAD AND PERHAPS MORE ULTIMATELY AND DOZENS MORE WOUNDED, WE CANNOT AFFORD TO TALK AROUND ISSUES ANYMORE. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES HEAD ON. I CALLED FOR A BAN AFTER SAN BERNARDINO AND WAS MET WITH GREAT ANGER, BUT NOW MANY YEARS AND I HAVE TO SAY MANY YEARS BUT MANY ARE SAYING THAT I WAS RIGHT TO DO SO AND ALTHOUGH THE PAUSE IS TEMPORARY, WE MUST FIND OUT WHAT IS GOING ON. WE HAVE TO DO IT. IT WILL BE LIFTED THIS BAN WHEN AND AS A NATION WE'RE IN A POSITION TO PROPERLY AND PERFECTLY SCREEN THESE PEOPLE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. THEY'RE POURING IN AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING. THE IMMIGRATION LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES GIVE THE PRESIDENT POWERS TO SUSPEND ENTRY INTO THE COUNTRY OF ANY CLASS OF PERSONS. NOW, ANY CLASS IT REALLY IS DETERMINED AND TO BE DETERMINED BY THE PRESIDENT. FOR THE INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES AND IT'S AS HE OR SHE DEEMS APPROPRIATE, HOPEFULLY IT'S HE IN THIS CASE.   >> THANK YOU. I WILL USE THIS POWER TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHEN I'M ELECTED, I WILL SUSPEND IMMIGRATION FROM AREAS OF THE WORLD WHERE THERE IS A PROVEN HISTORY OF TERRORISM AGAINST THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE OR OUR ALLIES UNTIL WE FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW TO END THESE THREATS. AFTER A FULL --  >> THANK YOU.  >> WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO ALLOW THOUSANDS UPON, UPON THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO POUR INTO THE COUNTRY, MANY OF WHOM HAVE THE SAME THOUGHT PROCESS AS THIS SAVAGE KILLER. MANY OF THE PRINCIPLES OF RADICAL ISLAM ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH WESTERN VALUES AND INSTITUTIONS.   >> I REFUSE TO ALLOW AMERICA TO BECOME A PLACE WHERE GAY PEOPLE, CHRISTIAN PEOPLE, JEWISH PEOPLE ARE TARGETS OF PERSECUTION AND INTIMIDATION BY RADICAL ISLAMIC PREACHERS OF HATE AND VIOLENCE.   >> THIS IS NOT JUST A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE, IT'S A QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUE. IF WE WANT TO PROTECT THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL AMERICANS, WOMEN AND CHILDREN, GAY AND STRAIGHT, JEWS AND CHRISTIANS AND ALL PEOPLE, THEN WE NEED TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT RADICAL ISLAM AND WE NEED TO DO IT NOW.   >> WE NEED TO TELL THE TRUTH ALSO ABOUT HOW RADICAL ISLAM IS COMING TO OUR SHORES. AND IT'S COMING. WITH THESE PEOPLE, FOLKS, IT'S COMING.   >> WE ARE BOARDING ISLAMIC TERRORISM INTO THE WEST THROUGH A FAILED IMMIGRATION SYSTEM AND THROUGH AN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HELD BACK BY OUR PRESIDENT. EVEN OUR OWN FBI DIRECTOR HAS ADMITTED THAT WE CANNOT EFFECTIVELY CHECK THE BACKGROUNDS OF PEOPLE WE ARE LETTING INTO AMERICA. ALL OF THE SEPTEMBER 11TH HIJACKERS WERE ISSUED VISAS, LARGE NUMBERS OF SOMALI REFUGEES IN MINNESOTA HAVE TRIED TO JOIN ISIS. THE BOSTON BOMBERS CAME HERE THROUGH POLITICAL ASYLUM. THE MALE SHOOTER IN SAN BERNARDINO, AGAIN WHOSE NAME I WILL NOT MENTION, WAS THE CHILD OF IMMIGRANT FROM PAKISTAN AND HE BROUGHT HIS WIFE, THE OTHER TERRORIST FROM SAUDI ARABIA THROUGH ANOTHER ONE OF OUR EASILY EXPLOITED VISA PROGRAMS.   >> IMMIGRATION FROM AFGHANISTAN INTO THE UNITED STATES IS INCREASED NEARLY FIVEFOLD IN JUST ONE YEAR. ACCORDING TO PEW RESEARCH, 99% OF THE PEOPLE IN AFGHANISTAN SUPPORT OPPRESSIVE SHARIA LAW. WE ADMIT MANY MORE AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS, WE ADMIT MANY MORE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, THEY SHARE THESE OPPRESSIVE VIEWS AND VALUES. WE WANT TO REMAIN A FREE AND OPEN SOCIETY, THEN AND IF WE DO WE HAVE TO CONTROL OUR BORDERS, WE HAVE TO CONTROL AND WE HAVE TO CONTROL THEM NOW, NOT LATER, RIGHT NOW.  >> THANK YOU.  >> YET HILLARY CLINTON FOR MONTHS AND DESPITE SO MANY ATTACKS REPEATEDLY REFUSED TO EVEN SAY THE WORDS RADICAL ISLAM UNTIL I CHALLENGED HER YESTERDAY AND GUESS WHAT, SHE WILL PROBABLY SAY THEM, SHE SORT OF HAS SAID THEM BUT LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS, SHE REALLY HAS NO CHOICE BUT SHE DOESN'T WANT, HOWEVER, SHE'S REALLY BEEN FORCED AND SHE HAS BEEN FORCED TO SAY THESE WORDS, SHE SUPPORTS AND THE REASON IS SHE SUPPORTS SO MUCH OF WHAT IS WRONG AND WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS COUNTRY AND WHAT'S GOING WRONG WITH OUR COUNTRY AND OUR BORDERS. SHE HAS NO CLUE IN MY OPINION WHAT RADICAL ISLAM IS AND SHE WON'T SPEAK ABOUT HONESTLY ABOUT IF SHE DOES, IN FACT, KNOW, SHE'S IN TOTAL DENIAL AND CONTINUING RELUCTANCE TO EVER NAME THE ENEMY BROADCAST WEAKNESS ACROSS THE ENTIRE WORLD, TRUE WEAKNESS.  >> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THAT BUT JUST A FEW WEEKS BEFORE SAN BERNARDINO, THE SLAUGHTER, THAT'S ALL IT WAS A SLAUGHTER, HILLARY CLINTON EXPLAINED HER REFUSAL TO SAY THE WORDS RADICAL ISLAM. HERE IS WHAT SHE SAID EXACT QUOTE, MUSLIMS ARE PEACEFUL AND TOLERANT PEOPLE AND HAVE NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH TERRORISM. THAT IS HILLARY CLINTON. SO SHE SAYS THE SOLUTION IS TO BAN GUNS. THEY TRIED THAT IN FRANCE, WHICH IS AMONG THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND 130 PEOPLE WERE BRUTALLY MURDERED BY ISLAMIC TERRORIST IN COLD BLOOD. HER PLAN IS TO DISARM LAW ABIDING AMERICANS, ABOLISHING THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND LEAVING ONLY THE BAD GUYS AND TERRORISTS WITH GUNS. NO GOOD. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, FOLKS. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.   >> NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU. SHE WANTS TO TAKE AWAY AMERICAN'S GUNS AND THEN ADMIT THE VERY PEOPLE THAT WANT TO SLAUGHTER US, LET THEM COME INTO THE COUNTRY, WE DON'T HAVE GUNS, LET THEM COME IN, LET THEM HAVE ALL THE FUN THEY WANT. I WILL BE MEETING WITH THE NRA WHICH HAS GIVEN ME THE EARLY ENDORSEMENT IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE TO DISCUSS HOW TO ENSURE AMERICANS HAVE THE MEANS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES IN THIS AGE OF TERROR. I WILL BE ALWAYS DEFENDING THE SECOND AMENDMENT.   >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE BOTTOM LINE IS HILLARY SUPPORTS POLICIES THAT BRING THE THREAT OF RADICAL ISLAM IN AMERICA AND ALLOW IT TO GROW OVERSEAS AND IT IS GROWING. IN FACT, HILLARY CLINTON'S IMMIGRATION PLAN WILL BRING VASTLY MORE RADICAL ISLAMIC IMMIGRATION INTO THIS COUNTRY, THREATENING NOT ONLY OUR SOCIETY BUT OUR ENTIRE WAY OF LIFE. WHEN IT COMES TO RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM, IGNORANCE IS NOT BLISS, IT'S DEADLY, TOTALLY DEADLY. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WITH THE SUPPORT OF HILLARY CLINTON AND OTHERS HAS ALSO DAMAGED OUR SECURITY BY RETRAINING OUR INTELLIGENCE, GATHERING -- WE HAVE JUST NO INTELLIGENCE GATHERING INFORMATION, WE NEED THIS INFORMATION SO BADLY AND HE STOPPED IT, WE DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT. WE DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM BECAUSE OBAMA IS NOT LETTING THEM DO THEIR JOB. THEY ARE NOT BEING ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOB AND THEY CAN DO IT WELL BETTER THAN ANYBODY, WE NEED A NEW LEADER, WE NEED A NEW LEADER FAST.   >> THANK YOU. THEY HAVE PUT POLITICAL CORRECTNESS ABOVE COMMON SENSE, ABOVE YOUR SAFETY AND ABOVE ALL ELSE. I REFUSE TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT.   >> WE NEED AN INTELLIGENCE GATHERING SYSTEM SECOND TO NONE, SECOND TO NONE, THAT INCLUDES COOPERATION BETWEEN STATE, LOCAL AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND WITH ALLIES, I WILL HAVE ATTORNEY GENERAL, A DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND SECRETARY OF DEFENSE WHO WILL KNOW HOW TO FIGHT THE WAR ON RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM.   >> AND THEY WILL HAVE THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO GET THE JOB DONE RIGHT, NOT LIKE IT IS RIGHT NOW. NOT RIGHT.   >> WE HAVE TO SCREEN APPLICANTS TO KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE AFFILIATED WITH OR SUPPORTING RADICAL GROUPS AND BELIEVES, VERY SIMPLE. WE HAVE TO CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE IMMIGRATION INTO THIS COUNTRY AND WE HAVE TO PREVENT LARGE POCKETS OF RADICALIZATION FROM FORMING INSIDE AMERICA.   >> NOT COMPLICATED. EVERY -- AND JUST THINK OF THIS, TAKE A LOOK, EVERY SINGLE EVENT EVEN A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL CAN BE DEVASTATING AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN ORLANDO AND WHAT HAPPENED IN OTHER CASES, JUST A SINGLE EVENT AND JUST ONE PERSON, CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THEY'LL DO IN LARGE GROUPS WHICH WE ARE ALLOWING TO COME HERE. TRULY OUR PRESIDENT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING. HE'S FAILED US AND HE'S FAILED US BADLY AND UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP THIS SITUATION WILL NOT GET ANY BETTER, IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE AND I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR A LONG TIME. EACH YEAR THE UNITED STATES PERMANENTLY ADMITS 100,000 IMMIGRANT FROM THE MIDDLE EAST AND MANY MORE FROM MUSLIM COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE MIDDLE EAST. OUR GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ADMITTING EVER-GROWING NUMBERS YEAR AFTER YEAR WITHOUT ANY EFFECTIVE PLAN FOR OUR OWN SECURITY. IN FACT, CLINTON STATE DEPARTMENT WAS IN CHARGE OF ADMISSIONS AND THE ADMISSION PROCESS FOR PEOPLE APPLYING TO ENTER FROM OVERSEAS. HAVING LEARNED NOTHING FROM THESE ATTACKS, SHE NOW PLANS TO MASSIVELY INCREASE ADMISSIONS WITHOUT A SCREENING PLAN INCLUDING A 500% INCREASE IN SYRIAN REFUGEES COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. TELL ME, TELL ME HOW STUPID IS THAT. THIS COULD BE A BETTER, BIGGER, MORE HORRIBLE VERSION THAN THE LEGENDARY TROJAN HORSE EVER WAS. ALL TOGETHER UNDER THE CLINTON PLAN, YOU'D BE ADMITTING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES FROM THE MIDDLE EAST WITH NO SYSTEM TO VET THEM OR TO PREVENT THE RADICALIZATION OF THE CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN. NOT ONLY THEIR CHILDREN, BY THE WAY, THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE OVER OUR CHILDREN AND CONVINCE THEM HOW WONDERFUL ISIS IS AND HOW WONDERFUL ISLAM IS AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. THE BURDEN IS ON HILLARY CLINTON TO TELL US WHY SHE BELIEVES IMMIGRATION FROM THESE DANGEROUS COUNTRIES SHOULD BE INCREASED WITHOUT ANY EFFECTIVE SYSTEM TO REALLY JUST SCREEN, WE ARE NOT SCREENING PEOPLE. SO WHY DON'T WE HAVE AN EFFECTIVE SCREENING SYSTEM. WE DON'T, WE ARE BEING LAUGHED AUTOALL OVER THE WORLD. THE BURDEN IS ON HILLARY CLINTON TO TELL US WHY WE SHOULD ADMIT ANYONE INTO OUR COUNTRY WHO SUPPORTS VIOLENCE OF ANY KIND AGAINST GAY AND LESBIAN AMERICANS, THE BURDEN IS ON HILLARY CLINTON TO TELL US HOW SHE WILL PAY FOR IT, HER PLAN WILL COST HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LONG TERM, WOULDN'T THIS BE MONEY BETTER SPENT REBUILDING AMERICA FOR OUR CURRENT POPULATION INCLUDING THE MANY POOR PEOPLE ALREADY LIVING HERE. WE HAVE CITIES, I HAVE INNER CITIES, WE HAVE POVERTY ALL OVER AND THIS IS HOW WE ARE SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE HAVE TO STOP THE TREMENDOUS FLOW OF SYRIAN REFUGEES INTO THE UNITED STATES. WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE, THEY HAVE NO DOCUMENTATION AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING AND WE WON'T UNLESS WE HAVE PROPER SUPERVISION AND PROPER LEADERSHIP IN WHICH CASE THEY'RE OUT OF HERE. WHAT I WANT --   >> WHAT I WANT IS COMMON SENSE. I WANT A MAINSTREAM IMMIGRATION POLICY THAT PROMOTES AMERICAN VALUES. THAT'S A CHOICE I PUT BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. A MAINSTREAM IMMIGRATION POLICY DESIGNED TO BENEFIT AMERICA OR HILLARY CLINTON'S RADICAL IMMIGRATION POLICY DESIGNED TO BENEFIT POLITICAL SPECIAL INTEREST. THAT'S ALL IT IS. WE HAVE TO GET SMART AND TOUGH AND VIGILANT AND WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW BECAUSE LATER IS TOO LATE, GOING TO BE TOO LATE FOR OUR COUNTRY. THE MEDIA TALKS ABOUT HOME-GROWN TERRORISM AND THE NETWORKS THAT NURTURE IT ARE IMPORTS FROM OVERSEAS, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR YOU DON'T LIKE THAT. YES, THERE ARE MANY RADICALIZED PEOPLE ALREADY INSIDE THE COUNTRY AS A RESULT OF POOR POLICIES OF THE PAST, BUT THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT WE WILL BE MUCH, MUCH AND IT WILL BE EASIER TO DEAL WITH OUR CURRENT PROBLEM IF WE DON'T KEEP ON BRINGING PEOPLE WHO ADD TO THE PROBLEM AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING, WE ARE LETTING ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COME IN AND ALL THEY'RE DOING IS ADDING TO THIS INCREDIBLE PROBLEM WE HAVE. FOR INSTANCE, THE CONTROVERSIAL MOSQUE ATTENDED BY BOSTON BOMBERS HEAD OF FOUNDER, IMMIGRANT OVERSEAS CHARGED IN PLOT, THIS SHOOTER AND AMAZINGLY IN ORLANDO WAS THE CHILD OF AN IMMIGRANT FATHER WHO SUPPORTED ONE OF THE MOST REPRESSIVE REGIMES ON EARTH. WHY WOULD WE ADMIT PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT VIOLENT HATRED? HILLARY CLINTON CAN NEVER CLAIM TO BE A FRIEND OF THE GAY COMMUNITY AS LONG AS SHE CONTINUES TO SUPPORT IMMIGRATION POLICIES THAT BRING ISLAMIC EXTREMIST TO OUR COUNTRY AND WHO SUPPRESS WOMEN, GAYS AND ANYONE ELSE WHO DOESN'T SHARE THEIR VIEWS OR VALUES.   >> SHE CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. SHE CAN'T CLAIM TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THESE COMMUNITIES WHILE TRYING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING IN WHO WANT TO OPPRESS THESE SAME COMMUNITIES. HOW DOES THIS KIND OF IMMIGRATION MAKE OUR LIVES BETTER? HOW DOES THIS KIND OF IMMIGRATION MAKE OUR COUNTRY BETTER? WHY DOES HILLARY CLINTON WANT TO BRING PEOPLE IN IN VAST NUMBERS WHO REJECT OUR VALUES? WHY? EXPLAIN. ASK YOURSELF WHO IS REALLY THE FRIEND OF WOMEN AND THE LB -- AND LGBT COMMUNITY, DONALD TRUMP WITH ACTIONS OR HILLARY CLINTON WITH HER WORDS. I WILL TELL YOU WHO THE BETTER FRIEND IS AND SOME DAY I BELIEVE THAT WILL BE PROVEN OUT BIGLY.   >> AND BY THE WAY THE LGBT COMMUNITY IS JUST WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM IS JUST SO SAD AND TO BE THINKING ABOUT WHERE THEIR POLICIES ARE CURRENTLY WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION IS A DISGRACE TO HAVE COMMUNITY, I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW. CLINTON WANTS TO ALLOW RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST TO POUR INTO OUR COUNTRY. THEY ENSLAVE WOMEN AND THEY MURDER GAYS. I DON'T WANT THEM IN OUR COUNTRY.   >> IMMIGRATION IS A PRIVILEGE AND WE SHOULD NOT LET ANYONE INTO THIS COUNTRY WHO DOESN'T SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES, ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. AMERICA IS ALREADY ADMITTED FOUR TIMES MORE IMMIGRANT THAN ANY COUNTRY ON EARTH, ANYBODY IN THE WORLD, FOUR TIMES MORE, AT LEAST BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO IS COMING IN AND WE CONTINUE TO ADMIT MILLIONS MORE WITH NO REAL CHECKS OR SCRUTINY. NOT SURPRISINGLY WAGES FOR OUR WORKERS HAVEN'T BUDGED IN ALMOST 20 YEARS. YOU WONDER WHY WE GET THE CROWDS, YOU WONDER WHY WE GET THE TREMENDOUS SUPPORT, YOU WONDER WHY I'VE GOTTEN MORE VOTES THAN ANY REPUBLICAN IN THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, TAKE A LOOK AT THAT, TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR SECURITY BUT TAKE A LOOK AT THE WAGES. FOR 18 YEARS THEY'VE BEEN STAGNANT, THEY'VE EVEN GONE DOWN. WHETHER IT'S A MATTER OF FINANCIAL SECURITY, WE CAN'T AFFORD IT. WE OWE $19 TRILLION IN DEBT AND NO LONGER HAVE ANY OPTIONS. OUR COMMUNITIES FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS ARE READY FOR SOME RELIEF. THIS IS NOT AN ACT OF OFFENSE AGAINST ANYONE, IT'S REALLY AN ACT OF DEFENSE. I WANT US ALL -- ALL OF US TO WORK TOGETHER, WE HAVE TO FORM A PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR MUSLIM COMMUNITIES, WE HAVE MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN THIS COUNTRY THAT ARE GREAT AND WE HAVE TO FORM THAT PARTNERSHIP. NOW, THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY SO IMPORTANTLY, THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH US, THEY HAVE TO COOPERATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TURN IN THE PEOPLE WHO THEY KNOW ARE BAD AND THEY KNOW IT, AND THEY HAVE TO DO IT AND THEY HAVE TO DO IT FORTHWITH. I WANT TO FIX OUR SCHOOLS AND BRIDGES AND OUR JOB'S MARKET WE ARE GOING TO HAVE IT ROCKET AGAIN. I WANT EVERY AMERICAN TO SUCCEED INCLUDING MUSLIMS, BUT THE MUSLIMS HAVE TO WORK WITH US. THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH US. THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. THEY KNOW THAT HE WAS BAD, THEY KNEW THE PEOPLE IN SAN BERNARDINO WERE BAD, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY DIDN'T TURN THEM IN AND WE HAD DEATH AND DESTRUCTION. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO EMPTY OUT THE TREASURY TO BRING PEOPLE INTO THE COUNTRY THAT INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS WHO PREACH HATE AGAINST OUR CITIZENS. I WANT TO PROTECT OUR CITIZENS, ALL OF OUR CITIZENS, THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON PULSE NIGHTCLUB DEMANDS A FULL AND COMPLETE INVESTIGATION INTO EVERY SINGLE ASPECT. IN SAN BERNARDINO AS AN EXAMPLE, PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON, THEY KNEW EXACTLY, THEY USED THE EXCUSE OF RACIAL PROFILING FOR NOT REPORTING IT. THEY SAID, WE THOUGHT SO BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO USE RACIAL PROFILING WHICH IS PROBABLY AN EXCUSE GIVEN TO THEM BY THEIR LAWYER SO THEY DON'T GET IN TROUBLE. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THEY DISCUSS WITH PARENTS, FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES. WE NEED TO KNOW IF HE WAS AFFILIATED WITH ANY RADICAL MOSQUES OR RADICAL ACTIVISTS AND WHAT, IF ANY, IS THERE IMMIGRATION STATUS. WE HAVE TO KNOW AND WE HAVE TO KNOW FAST. WE NEED TO KNOW IF HE TRAVELED ANYWHERE AND WHO HE TRAVELED WITH. WE NEED TO KNOW AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE EVERY SINGLE LAST PERSON INVOLVED IN THIS PLAN, INCLUDING ANYONE WHO KNEW SOMETHING BUT DIDN'T TELL US IS BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. SO WHEN PEOPLE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND THEY DON'T TELL US AND WE HAVE AN ATTACK AND PEOPLE DIE, THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE CONSEQUENCES. BIG CONSEQUENCES.

LAST NIGHT HE THANKED   SUPPORTERS AND VOWED TO BRING   THE COUNTRY TOGETHER.   MR. TRUMP DELIVERED HIS REMARKS TO A ROOM FULL OF SUPPORTERS AT   THE TRUMP NATIONAL GOLF CLUB WESTCHESTER.  IT'S ABOUT 20 MINUTES.  BECAUSE WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS OF THE WORLD  MR. TRUMP:   THANK YOU.  THANK YOU. WOW.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  HELLO. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY  THANKING THE PEOPLE OF MONTANA,   SOUTH DAKOTA, NEW MEXICO, NEW JERSEY, AND CALIFORNIA. WE HAD SOME BIG, BIG DAYS AND   WE HAD SOME BIG NUMBERS COMING   IN. VERY BIG NUMBERS.   I AM TRULY HONORED BY YOUR  SUPPORT.  TOGETHER, WE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT  NOBODY THOUGHT WAS ABSOLUTELY   POSSIBLE.   AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS.  WE'RE ONLY GETTING STARTED AND   IT'S GOING TO BE BEAUTIFUL.   REMEMBER THAT.  TONIGHT, WE CLOSE ONE CHAPTER IN HISTORY AND BEGIN ANOTHER.  OUR CAMPAIGN RECEIVED MORE  PRIMARY VOTES THAN ANY G.O.P. CAMPAIGN IN HISTORY, NO MATTER   WHO IT IS, NO MATTER WHO THEY   ARE, WE RECEIVED MORE VOTES.  THIS IS --   THIS IS A GREAT FEELING.  A GREAT FEELING.  THIS IS NOT A TESTAMENT TO ME BUT A TESTAMENT TO ALL OF THE   PEOPLE WHO BELIEVED REAL   CHANGE, NOT OBAMA CHANGE, BUT   REAL CHANGE IS POSSIBLE.   YOU'VE GIVEN ME THE   HONOR TO LEAD THE REPUBLICAN   PARTY TO VICTORY THIS FALL.   WE ARE GOING TO DO IT. WE ARE GOING TO DO IT, FOLKS.  WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.   I UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY   OF CARRYING THE MANTLE AND I WILL NEVER EVER LET YOU DOWN.   TOO MUCH WORK, TOO MANY PEOPLE,   BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS, NEVER   GOING TO LET YOU DOWN.  I WILL MAKE YOU PROUD OF YOUR   PARTY AND OUR MOVEMENT.   AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS, A   MOVEMENT.   NOW, RECENT POLLS HAVE SHOWN   THAT I'M BEATING HILLARY   CLINTON AND WITH ALL OF HER   MANY PROBLEMS AND THE   TREMENDOUS MISTAKES THAT SHE'S MADE, AND SHE HAS MADE TREMENDOUS MISTAKES, WE EXPECT   OUR LEAD TO CONTINUE TO GROW   AND GROW SUBSTANTIALLY.    TO EVERYONE WHO VOTED FOR ME THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN, I WANT TO THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY, VERY   MUCH.    TO THOSE WHO VOTED FOR SOMEONE ELSE IN EITHER   PARTY, I WILL WORK HARD TO EARN YOUR SUPPORT, AND I WILL WORK   VERY HARD TO EARN THAT SUPPORT. TO ALL OF THOSE BERNIE SANDERS'   VOTERS WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT   IN THE COLD OF A RIG SYSTEM OF   SUPERDELEGATES, WE WELCOME YOU   WITH OPEN ARMS.    AND, BY THE WAY, THE   TERRIBLE TRADE DEAL THAT BERNIE   WAS SO VEHEMENTLY AGAINST AND   HE IS RIGHT ON THAT, WILL BE  TAKEN CARE OF FAR BETTER THAN   ANYONE EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE  AND THAT IS WHAT I DO.  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FANTASTIC   TRADE DEALS.  WE'RE GOING TO START MAKING   MONEY AND BRINGING IN JOBS.   NOW, I KNOW SOME PEOPLE SAY I   AM TOO MUCH OF A FIGHTER.   MY PREFERENCE IS ALWAYS PEACE,  HOWEVER, AND I'VE SHOWN THAT.   I'VE SHOWN THAT FOR A LONG   TIME. I BUILT AN EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS ON RELATIONSHIPS AND   DEALS THAT BENEFIT ALL PARTIES INVOLVED, ALWAYS.   MY GOAL IS ALWAYS, AGAIN, TO  BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. BUT IF I'M FORCED TO FIGHT FOR SOMETHING I REALLY CARE ABOUT, I WILL NEVER EVER BACK DOWN AND   OUR COUNTRY WILL NEVER EVER BACK DOWN.   THANK YOU. I HAVE FOUGHT FOR MY FAMILY. I'VE FOUGHT FOR MY BUSINESS. I FOUGHT FOR MY EMPLOYEES, AND   NOW I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR YOU,   THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  LIKE NOBODY HAS EVER FOUGHT BEFORE.    AND I'M NOT A   POLITICIAN FIGHTING, I'M ME.  YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME REAL   GOOD THINGS HAPPEN.   JUST REMEMBER THIS.   I'M GOING TO BE YOUR CHAMPION. I'M GOING TO BE AMERICA'S CHAMPION.   BECAUSE YOU SEE, THIS ELECTION ISN'T ABOUT REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT.   IT'S ABOUT WHO RUNS THIS COUNTRY -- THE SPECIAL INTERESTS OR THE PEOPLE, AND I   MEAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? EVERY PLEX YEAR POLITICIANS PROMISE -- EVERY YEAR POLITICSES PROMISE CHANGE.  OBAMA PROMISED CHANGE AND IT   DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO YEAR AND EVERY YEAR THEY FAIL TO   DELIVER. WHY WOULD POLITICIANS WANT TO   CHANGE A SYSTEM THAT'S TOTALLY   RIGGED THAT KEEPS THEM IN   POWER?  THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING,   FOLKS. WHY WOULD POLITICIANS WANT TO   CHANGE A SYSTEM THAT'S MADE   THEM AND THEIR FRIENDS VERY, VERY WEALTHY?   I BEAT A RIGGED SYSTEM BY WINNING WITH OVERWHELMING   SUPPORT. THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD HAVE   DONE IT.  LANDSLIDES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY   WITH EVERY DEMOGRAPHIC ON TRACK   TO WIN, 37 PRIMARY CAUCUS   VICTORIES IN A FIELD THAT BEGAN WITH 17 VERY TALENTED PEOPLE.   AFTER YEARS OF DISAPPOINTMENT, THERE'S ONE THING WE ALL HAVE LEARNED, WE CAN'T FIX THE   RIGGED SYSTEM BY RELYING ON   VERY -- AND I MEAN THIS VERY SO, SO STRONGLY -- ON THE VERY   PEOPLE WHO RIGGED IT, AND THEY   RIGGED IT AND DO NOT EVER THINK   ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY. WE CAN'T SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS BY   COUNTING ON THE POLITICIANS WHO   CREATED OUR PROBLEMS. THE CLINTONS HAVE TURNED THE POLITICS OF PERSONAL ENRICHMENT INTO AN ART FORM FOR THEMSELVES.    THEY HAVE MADE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SELLING ACCESS. SELLING FAVORS. SELLING GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, AND I MEAN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SECRETARY CLINTON EVEN DID ALL OF THE WORK ON A TOTALLY ILLEGAL PRIVATE SERVER. SOMETHING ABOUT HOW SHE'S   GETTING AWAY WITH THIS, FOLKS,   NOBODY UNDERSTANDS. DESIGNED TO KEEP HER CORRUPT   DEALINGS OUT OF THE PUBLIC RECORD, PUTTING THE SECURITY OF   THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AT RISK AND A PRESIDENT IN A CORRUPT SYSTEM IS TOTALLY PROTECTING HER. NOT RIGHT.  I AM GOING TO GIVE A MAJOR   SPEECH ON PROBABLY MONDAY OF   NEXT WEEK, AND WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING ALL OF THE THINGS   THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE WITH THE CLINTONS.   I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IT   VERY INFORMATIVE AND VERY, VERY   INTERESTING.   I WONDER IF THE  PRESS WILL WANT TO ATTEND.  WHO KNOWS.  HILLARY CLINTON TURNED THE  STATE DEPARTMENT INTO HER PRIVATE HEDGE FUND.   THE RUSSIANS, THE SAUDIS, THE   CHINESE, ALL GAVE MONEY TO BILL   AND HILLARY AND GOT FAVORABLE   TREATMENT IN RETURN.  IT'S A SAD DAY IN AMERICA WHEN FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS WITH DEEP   POCKETS HAVE MORE INFLUENCE IN  OUR OWN COUNTRY THAN OUR GREAT CITIZENS.   I DIDN'T NEED TO DO THIS. IT'S NOT EASY, BELIEVE ME.  I DIDN'T NEED TO DO IT BUT I   FELT LIKE I HAD TO GIVE BACK TO   OUR WONDERFUL COUNTRY WHICH HAS BEEN SO GOOD TO ME AND TO MY FAMILY.    I HAVE TRAVELED TO   MANY OF OUR STATES AND SEEN THE SUFFERING IN PEOPLE'S EYES.   I HAVE VISITED COMMUNITIES IN   NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, PENNSYLVANIA, CONNECTICUT, AND -- INDIANA AND OHIO WHOSE MANUFACTURING JOBS, HAVE VIRTUALLY DISAPPEARED.  AN EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR COUNTRY   AND IT'S HORRIBLE. I EMBRACED THE VICTIMS OF   ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.  MOMS AND DADS WHO HAVE HAD TO BURY THEIR OWN CHILDREN BECAUSE OF PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE   BEEN IN THE COUNTRY.  REMEMBER IT, FOLKS, REMEMBER IT.    I VISITED THE CRUMBLING CITIES AND THE STRUGGLING SCHOOLS. I HAVE SEEN OUR DILAPIDATED AIRPORTS, HIGHWAYS, BRIDGES,   AND I'VE COMPARED THEM TO OTHER   COUNTRIES WHERE WE SEE FACILITIES SO FAR SUPERIOR TO OURS IT'S REALLY NOT TO BE BELIEVED. HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT'S HAPPENED TO OUR COUNTRY.   AMERICA IS GETTING TAKEN APART PIECE BY PIECE, AUCTIONED OFF AND JUST RAPIDLY AUCTIONED OFF TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.  WE'RE BROKE. WE'RE BROKE.  WE ARE $19 TRILLION GOING   QUICKLY TO $21 TRILLION.  OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS A   DISASTER.   OUR SCHOOLS ARE FAILING. CRIME IS RISING.  PEOPLE ARE SCARED.  THE LAST THING WE NEED IS   HILLARY CLINTON IN THE WHITE   HOUSE OR AN EXTENSION OF THE OBAMA DISASTER.     WHAT A CROWD.  WHAT A CROWD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY.  WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY.  BUT WE CAN TURN THIS ALL   AROUND. WE'RE GOING TO DO IT BY PUTTING   AMERICA FIRST.   THAT COMMITMENT IS   THE FOUNDATION FOR CHANGE THAT'S BEEN MISSING AND IT'S   BEEN MISSING FOR A LONG TIME. IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT AMERICA FIRST MEANS.   IT MEANS ON FOREIGN POLICY WE WILL NEVER ENTER INTO ANY CONFLICT UNLESS IT MAKES US   SAFER AS A NATION.  IT HAS TO MAKE US SAFER AS A NATION.   THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF   HILLARY'S FOREIGN POLICY WHICH   INVEIGHEDED LIBYA, DESTABILIZED   IRAQ, UNLEASHED ISIS AND THREW   SYRIA INTO CHAOS AND CREATED   THE MASS MIGRATION WHICH IS WREAKING HAVOC ALL OVER THE   WORLD AND WHILE PUTTING IRAN ON   THE PATH TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND MAKING THEM A DOMINANT POWER IN   THE MIDDLE EAST. AND THEY ARE DOMINANT AND WE HAVE MADE THEM THAT WAY, FOLKS.   WE HAVE MADE THEM THAT WAY.   BETTER HOPE I'M PRESIDENT. ON TRADE AMERICA FIRST MEANS   THE AMERICAN WORKER WILL HAVE   HIS OR HER JOB PROTECTED FROM UNFAIR FOREIGN COMPETITION. WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE IS   ABSOLUTELY A DISGRACE.  NO T.P.P., YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. AND YOU MEAN NO P.P. WE ARE GOING -- AND REMEMBER THIS.   WE ARE ONLY GOING TO HAVE GREAT   TRADE DEALS, OK.  WE ARE ONLY GOING TO HAVE THAT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO APPROVE -- AS SOMEBODY JUST SAID -- THE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP,   WHICH IS A DISASTER, A DISASTER   FOR OUR COUNTRY.  ALMOST AS BAD AS NAFTA.   SIGNED BY BILL CLINTON, WHICH   HAS JUST STRIPPED OUR COUNTRIES OF OUR FACTRIES AND   MANUFACTURING AND MOVED THEM TO OTHER PLACES, IN PARTICULAR,   MEXICO. IF IT'S NOT A GREAT DEAL FOR OUR COUNTRY, WE WILL NOT SIGN   IT.   IT'S GOT TO BE GREAT FOR OUR   COUNTRY, FOR OUR COMMUNITY, FOR EVERYBODY IN HERE BECAUSE, BELIEVE ME, WE ARE ALL   SUFFERING AND WE'RE SUFFERING BIG LEAGUE AND IT'S GETTING WORSE.  ON ENERGY POLICY, AMERICA FIRST MEANS OPENING UP AMERICA'S   GREAT POTENTIAL TO BRING WEALTH AND PROSPERITY TO OUR OWN   WORKERS, INCLUDING OUR WONDERFUL AND HARDWORKING MINERS WHO HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY   TOTALLY MISTREATED BY THIS ADMINISTRATION. ON ECONOMIC POLICY, AMERICA FIRST MEANS HAVING TAX AND REGULATORY POLICIES THAT KEEP   JOBS AND WEALTH IN THE UNITED STATES. SUBSTANTIALLY LOWERING TAXES FOR MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS AND BUSINESSES. LIKEWISE, REGULATION, WHICH IS STRANGLING OUR ECONOMY, WHICH WOULD BE BROUGHT DOWN FROM ITS  PAREN INSANE LEVELS, WE WILL   MAKE IT VERY, VERY GOOD FOR OUR COMPANIES, FOR OUR SMALL BUSINESSES, AND FOR   PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SURVIVE AND  DO WELL IN OUR COUNTRY.    ON IMMIGRATION POLICY, AMERICA FIRST MEANS PROTECTING THE JOBS, WAGES, AND   SECURITY OF AMERICAN WORKERS.  WHETHER FIRST OR 10TH GENERATION. NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE WE ARE   GOING TO PROTECT YOUR JOBS.   BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU, OUR   JOBS ARE BEING STRIPPED FROM   OUR COUNTRY LIKE WE'RE BABIES.  THE BEAUTY OF AMERICA FIRST IS   THAT IT BRINGS US ALL TOGETHER.   EVERY AMERICAN WORKER OF EVERY   BACKGROUND IS ENTITLED TO THE   SAME BENEFITS, PROTECTIONS AND   RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES. IT'S GOT TO BE THAT WAY.  NOW, THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE SAY   THINGS CAN'T CHANGE.  I'M HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU THAT   WE HAVE TO CHANGE.  WE HAVE NO CHOICE.  WE HAVE TO CHANGE. WE'RE GOING TO PUT -- THANK   YOU.   WE'RE GOING TO PUT   AMERICA BACK TO WORK.   WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR OWN PRODUCTS.   WE'RE GOING TO PUT AMERICA BACK   TO WORK.   WE'RE GOING TO REBUILD OUR INNER CITIES WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY A SHAME AND SO   SAD. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT   HAVE BEEN MISTREATED FOR SO LONG.    WE'RE GOING TO MAKE   YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SAFE, SECURE AND PROSPEROUS.  PROSPEROUS AGAIN.   TOGETHER, WE WILL PUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FIRST AGAIN.  FIRST AGAIN.  WE WILL MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES WEALTHY.  WE WILL MAKE OUR CITIES SAFE AGAIN.  WE'LL MAKE OUR COUNTRY STRONG AGAIN.  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE WILL   MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. REMEMBER.   THANK YOU.  THANK YOU.   THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU.    ",Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Primary Night Speech

THEY ARE PLAYING GAMES. IT'S GOING THE WRONG WAY.  THEY HAD A LABOR PARTICIPATION  RATE, IT FELL TO 62.6%, WHICH IS  ONE OF THE WORST IN MANY, MANY,  MANY YEARS.  SO WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.  WE ARE GOING TO TURN IT AROUND  AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,  BRING BACK OUR JOBS, BRING BACK  OUR JOBS AND BRING IT BACK FAST.  SO YOU REMEMBER THE 1237 AND  THEY SAID, I DON'T THINK TRUMP WILL REACH IT.  MAYBE AT THE CONVENTION.  I SAID WE ARE GOING TO REACH IT  EASY.  WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE  REACHED IT LONG BEFORE HILLARY  CLINTON?  SHE CAN'T CLOSE THE DEAL.  SHE CAN'T CLOSE IT.  SHE'S WORKING HARD AND CAN'T  CLOSE IT WITH BERNIE.  GOOD OLD BERNIE.  WE LOVE OUR BERNIE.  I TELL YOU WHAT, WHAT A MESS  SHE'S IN.  AND THE PEOPLE WITH BERNIE DON'T  WANT TO VOTE FOR HER AND THEY  WANT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP.  YOU SAW THAT POLL.  BECAUSE WHETHER YOU LIKE BERNIE  OR NOT, HE'S RIGHT ABOUT ONE  THING, TRADE IS A DISASTER FOR  OUR COUNTRY.  THAT'S THE ONE THING HE IS RIGHT ABOUT.  THE TRADE DEALS THAT OUR COUNTRY MAKES OURARE AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER.  HELLO. LOOK AT ALL THOSE PEOPLE OVER THERE. THIS IS CRAZY.  WOW!  I WISH THESE CAMERA GUYS WOULD  SPIN IT AROUND. THEY ARE SO DISHONEST, 100 SOMETHING DEGREES OUT HERE TO  HAVE THIS NUMBER OF PEOPLE. ARE WE HAPPY TO BE HERE?   ON JUNE 7, YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE, BECAUSE YOU KNOW, WE ARE SETTING RECORDS. WE HAVE ALREADY BROKEN THE RECORD, IN ALL FAIRNESS. I LIKE THAT CAP. HE HAS THE SAME CAP I HAVE ON. HUNTERS, THE N.R.A., THEY GAVE ME THE ENDORSEMENT. YOU SAW THAT.  GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE.  WAYNE AND CHRIS, THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE.  THEY GAVE ME THE EARLIEST  ENDORSEMENT I THINK THEY HAVE  EVER GIVEN TO ANYBODY. NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION.  WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  WE WILL PROTECT YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  I LOVE YOU, TOO.  NICE GUY OVER THERE.  BIG STRONG GUY.  I LOVE YOU.  SO, LOOK, WE HAVE HAD AN  INCREDIBLE PERIOD OF TIME JUNE  16 WE STARTED AND IT'S BEEN AN  AMAZING RIDE.  ALL OVER THE WORLD THEY ARE  TALKING ABOUT IT, IT'S A  MOVEMENT.  THEY SAID THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN  ANYTHING LIKE IT.  THE BIGGEST CROWDS OF ANYBODY BY FAR.  THE OTHER NIGHT, BERNIE HAD  3,000 AND I HAD 17,000.   AND THEY TALKED ABOUT  ME, DONALD TRUMP MADE A SPEECH,  NEVER MENTIONED THE NUMBER OF  PEOPLE AND BERNIE HAS HAD A  MASSIVE CROWD OF 3,000 PEOPLE.  I TELL YOU WHAT, THE PRESS IS SO  BIASED AGAINST US, BUT I BELIEVE  WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.  I REALLY BELIEVE IT.  YOU KNOW, THEY USED TO CALL IT  THE SILENT MAJORITY, NOW I THINK  WE ARE GOING TO CALL IT THE NOISY MAJORITY. WE ARE NOT SILENT. IN SAN JOSE, WE HAD AN AMAZING  CROWD. IT WAS PACKED AND IT WAS  INCREDIBLE AND AT THE BASKETBALL  ON, WHICH IS THAT AREA, THE SAN  FRANCISCO GAME, AND WE HAD SOME CROWD.  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. AND IT WAS A LOVE FEST INSIDE,  NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER. WE WENT ON AND SPOKE AND HAD A  GOOD TIME FOR AN HOUR AND I SAID  I WANT TO GET YOU GUYS SO YOU  COULD SEE THE WARRIORS, WHO WON.  BUT I WANTED TO GET THEM OUT AND I SAID WE DON'T WANT TO GET OUT. WE HAD AN AMAZING TIME. THAT WAS IT AND WE WRAPPED UP AND EVERYBODY WAS CHEERING LIKE CRAZY FOREVER AND THEY WALKED OUT AND THEY GET ACCOSTED BY A BUNCH OF THUGS BURNING THE  AMERICAN FLAG, BURNING THE AMERICAN FLAG. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE? THEY'RE THUGS. BUILD THAT WALL.  YOU'RE RIGHT.   WE ARE GOING TO BUILD THE WALL, FOLKS. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. YOU SAW -- I HAVE A LOT OF ENDORSEMENTS AND PAUL RYAN JUST ENDORSED ME AND MITCH MCCONNELL, BUT WE HAVE TREMENDOUS SUPPORT.  WHEN YOU THINK THAT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR PARTY, MORE VOTES  THAN ANYBODY THAT HAS EVER DONE  THIS BEFORE.  THINK OF IT. MORE THAN DWIGHT EISENHOWER. I MEAN HE WON THE SECOND WAR, MORE THAN RONALD REAGAN WHO WE ALL LOVE, MORE THAN ANYBODY AND WE HAVE A LOT OF ENDORSEMENTS AND WE ARE VERY POPULAR WITHIN  THE PARTY AND POLLS ARE COMING  OUT SHOWING WE ARE DOING WELL  AND WINNING. THE FOX POLL CAME OUT A FEW DAYS  AGO AND WE ARE WINNING BY THREE  POINTS.  WE ARE BEATING HILLARY.  DID YOU SEE THAT PHONY SPEECH  SHE MADE YESTERDAY.  AND PEOPLE THINK, OH, DID SHE  SPEAK WELL.  SHE HAS A TELEPROMPTER HERE AND THERE.  DO YOU NOTICE, DONALD TRUMP IS A  BAD MAN.  DONALD TRUMP HAS A BAD TONE.  WE NEED A TOUGH TONE IN THIS COUNTRY.  WE DON'T NEED THIS KIND OF STUFF ANYMORE.  SHE SAID, I DON'T LIKE THE TONE  OF DONALD TRUMP, THAT WAS A  WHILE AGO.  SHE SAID I DON'T LIKE HIS TONE.  AND I'M SAYING TO MYSELF, THEY  ARE CHOPPING OFF PEOPLE'S HEADS  AND KILLING US AT THE BORDER.  OUR COUNTRY'S A MESS.  WE HAVE THE WORST JOBS REPORT IN  6 1/2 YEARS.  OUR LABOR PARTICIPATION RATE,  YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT DECADES OF  A DISASTER.  PEOPLE ARE MAKING LESS MONEY NOW  THAN THEY MADE 18 YEARS AGO AND  WORKING HARDER.  AND I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE A NICE TONE.  HELLO, EVERYBODY.  HOW'S EVERYTHING.  WE ARE GOING TO BRING BACK OUR JOBS.  WE ARE GOING TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK.  WE ARE GOING TO RUN IT PROPERLY, FOLKS.  AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE PROUD OF  YOUR COUNTRY AGAIN.  AND YOU KNOW THEY DO RESEARCH. U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A., I LIKE THAT.  I LIKE THAT.  SO CALIFORNIA, GOOD PLACE.  I'M GOING TO PLAY HEAVY IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK WE CAN WIN IT.  I MEAN WE GET CROWDS LIKE THIS  ALL OVER THE PLACE AND DIDN'T EVEN GIVE YOU A HANGAR. THEY DON'T GIVE HANGARS ANYMORE. BUT IT'S AMAZING THE KIND OF RECEPTION THAT WE HAVE. AND EVERY MAGAZINE AND EVERY NEWSPAPER WHETHER THEY LIKE US OR NOT AND I SAY FOLKS, I'M A MESSENGER. AM I DOING A GOOD JOB?   IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT'S HAPPENED. AND PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT'S THE  MOST INCREDIBLE POLITICAL PHENOMENON.  ONE OF THE PUNDITS TOLD ME THE  OTHER DAY AND SAID YOU KNOW, IT  DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU WIN  OR LOSE, THE JOB YOU'VE DONE IS  SO INCREDIBLE.  YOU CAME FROM NOWHERE AND NEVER  DID THIS BEFORE AND FIGHTING 17  GOVERNORS AND SENATORS AND  PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS, I HAVE  BEEN FIGHTING THEM ALL MY LIFE  AND I LIKE FIGHTING, BUT YOU  HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THESE PEOPLE  AND WEEK AFTER WEEK YOU ARE DOWN  TO 16, YOU ARE DOWN TO 14, YOU  ARE DOWN TO 9,, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  AND THEY SAID IT HASN'T BEEN  ANYTHING LIKE IT.  IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER WE WIN  OR LOSE.  IT WILL BE IN THE HISTORY BOOKS FOREVER.  THEY SAID IT NEVER HAPPENED.  BILL O'REILLY SAID, THE SINGLE  GREATEST POLITICAL PHENOMENON HE  HAS SEEN IN HIS LIFE.  AND I'M SAYING WHAT THE HELL ARE  WE TALKING ABOUT?  WE HAVE TO WIN.  WE HAVE TO WIN.  WE DIDN'T COME THIS FAR TO LOSE.  WE ARE GOING TO PLAY CALIFORNIA  BECAUSE I THINK HILLARY IS  PATHETIC AND SHOULD BE IN JAIL  FOR WHAT SHE DID WITH HER EMAILS.  SHE SHOULD BE IN JAIL.  SHE SHOULD BE IN JAIL FOR WHAT  SHE DID WITH THOSE EMAILS.  SHE WANTS TO PLAY A LITTLE TOUGH.  YOU KNOW, SHE POLLS IT, EVERY  WORD SHE SAID WAS POLLED.  I DON'T HAVE TELEPROMPTERS. IT'S CALLED UP HERE AND MEMORY AND CALLED OTHER THINGS.  AND I SPEAK FROM HERE AND FROM  THE HEART, OK, BECAUSE THAT'S  WHAT WE NEED.  AND EVERY SINGLE THING SHE SAID  YESTERDAY WAS POLLED AND HER  PEOPLE WROTE IT OUT AND DON'T  SEE THE TELEPROMPTERS. THEY SAID OH, THEY DIDN'T KNOW  THAT. SHE'S READING THE SCRIPT AND SHE WOULD READ A LINE AND PHONY AUDIENCE. SHE WOULD HAVE THE PHONY  AUDIENCE AND THE GUY IN THE BACK  GOING NOW AND THEY CLAP. AND THESE PUNDITS -- IF I EVER DID THAT, I WOULD BE RUN OUT OF TOWN. BUT FOR HILLARY IS OK. WHAT SHE SAID WAS SO MANY LIES. LIKE HE WANTS JAPAN TO GET NUCLEAR WEAPONS. I DON'T WANT THEM TO GET NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  I WANT THEM TO PAY US THE KIND  OF MONEY WE HAVE TO HAVE SO WE  DON'T LOSE MONEY PROTECTING  JAPAN AND GERMANY AND SAUDI ARABIA.  WE HAVE TO DO THIS.  AND SOUTH KOREA.  I MEAN WE ARE PROTECTING SOUTH  KOREA FROM THE MANIAC IN THE  NORTH AND WE'RE PROTECTING THEM.  HE ACTUALLY SAID -- YOU KNOW  THEY SAID WOULD YOU MIND HAVING  NEGOTIATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA.  NO PROBLEM.  WHO THE HELL CARES.  I'M NOT GOING THERE.  BUT YOU HAVE A NEGOTIATION.  THEY SAID WE WILL NEVER TALK.  HOW STUPID ARE THESE PEOPLE?  THEY HAVE BEEN SELLING OUR  COUNTRY DOWN THE TUBE.  THEY HAVE BEEN SPENDING MONEY,  WHO KNOWS IF THE TALKS WORK,  MAYBE THEY WILL, MAYBE THEY WON'T.  AND PUTIN SAID DONALD TRUMP IS A  GENIUS AND NEXT GREAT LEADER OF  THE UNITED STATES.  THEY WANTED ME TO DISAVOW WHAT  HE SAID.  HOW DARE YOU CALL ME A GENIUS.  HOW DARE YOU CALL ME A GENIUS, VLADIMIR.  WOULDN'T IT BE NICE WE WOULD GET  ALONG WITH RUSSIA.  I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT WEAKNESS.  I KNOW ABOUT NEGOTIATING.  HILLARY CLINTON IS A WEAK PERSON.  SHE IS TOTALLY SCRIPTED.  SHE IS A THIEF AND SHE SHOULD BE  IN JAIL FOR WHAT SHE DID TO OUR  NATIONAL SECURITY.  I MEAN THE ONLY PROBLEM IS I  WOULD LIKE TO RUN AGAINST HER,  IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH.  SHE SHOULD BE.  WHAT SHE HAS DONE IS TERRIBLE.  SO, LOOK, WE HAVE -- I CAN'T  BELIEVE IT.  LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE  TRYING TO GET IN.  LOOK AT THOSE PEOPLE.  LOOK AT THAT.  LOOK AT ALL THOSE PEOPLE.  THEY COULDN'T HAVE PULLED THESE  FENCES A LITTLE BIT FURTHER OUT?  YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO COME IN.  YOU HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE HERE. THAT'S THE WAY LIFE WORKS.  LIFE IS VICIOUS. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES, YOU LOOK AT THE WORD TONE, BUT I'LL USE A DIFFERENT WORD, BERNIE SANDERS SAID THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS  BAD JUDGMENT. SHE HAS BAD JUDGMENT. WE ARE IN A CYBERWORLD. THIS IS NOW A CYBERWORLD. RUSSIA IS KNOCKING US OFF. CHINA IS KNOCKING US OFF. THEY ARE STEALING SO MUCH. WHAT CHINA'S DOING WITH OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, STILLING BILLIONS. WE AREN'T DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT, DURING HER REGIME. YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON. HERE IS HILLARY ALL LOUSED UP WITH A SIMPLE EMAIL SYSTEM AND ASKED WHY DID SHE DO IT? I UNDERSTAND WHY SHE DID IT,  BECAUSE SHE'S A THIEF. I GET WHY SHE DID IT. BUT TALK ABOUT JUDGMENT, HOW DO YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WITH THAT KIND OF BAD JUDGMENT. SHE COULD HAVE USED THE GOVERNMENT STUFF. SHE COULD HAVE TAKEN THE GOVERNMENT SERVER, ASSUME EVERYONE IS LISTENING.  I ALWAYS DO EVERY TIME I PICK UP  A PHONE. YOU SUE THEIR ASS OFF IF THEY  ARE AND DROP A LITTLE LAWSUIT ON  THEM AND MAKE THEM PAY.  BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?  FOR HER TO DO WHAT SHE DID PUTS  OUR COUNTRY AT RISK.  SHE'S SECRETARY OF STATE.  SHE'S GOT PEOPLE LIKE HUMA,  ANTHONY WEINER, WIFE OF ANTHONY  WEINER, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE  ANTHONY WEINER TO BE HAVING ALL THESE SECRETS.  GUESS WHAT, SHE TELLS ANTHONY WEINER.  I KNOW ANTHONY WEINER.  I DON'T WANT HIM KNOWING ANYTHING.  AND I NEVER EVER WANT HIM TO  TWEET ME.  DOES ANYBODY WANT HIM TO TWEET?  SHE'S MARRIED TO ANTHONY WEINER  AND GOES HOME -- THAT'S THE WAY  LIFE WORKS.  SHE GOES HOME.  WHO THE HELL WANTS THAT.  THIS IS NOT RIGHT.  IT'S NOT RIGHT.  GENERAL PETRAEUS HAS SUFFERED  GREATLY AND MANY PEOPLE SUFFERED  GREATLY FOR DOING FAR LESS THAN  WHAT HILLARY CLINTON DID.  AND YOU KNOW WHAT?  TO ME, AS THE WOMAN JUST SAID,  BUT SHE GOT AWAY WITH IT.  IT LOOKS LIKE SHE GOT AWAY WITH  IT -- UNLESS I WIN.   AND EVERYTHING WILL  BE FAIR, BUT WE ARE GOING TO  HAVE AN ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE  ATTORNEY GENERAL IS GOING TO  TAKE A LOOK AND SEE, BECAUSE YOU  KNOW THERE'S A FIVE YEAR OR  SIX-YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. SO SHE REALLY IS RUNNING FOR  SOME VERY IMPORTANT REASONS FOR HERSELF. LOOK, WHEN SOMEBODY DOES  SOMETHING SO WRONG AS THAT, THEY  HAVE TO PAY THE CONSEQUENCES. SHE PUT OUR NATION IN DIFFICULTY. DID YOU SEE HER I.T. SPECIALIST, HE'S TAKING THE FIFTH. THE WORD IS HE'S RATTING HER OUT LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT,  BUT THEY WANT TO TRY AND FAVOR, -- SAVE HER.  THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE  GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK.  THEY AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE TRYING TO SAVE HER BUT SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THE RIGHT THING. BUT THE PRESS NEVER LETS UP AND IT NEVER FOLLOWS THAT STORY. IT NEVER FOLLOWS THE REAL STORY. SO DO YOU REMEMBER IN IOWA, I MADE A SPEECH. AND I SAID LET'S RAISE SOME MONEY FOR OUR VETS.  AND I FIGURED WE WOULD RAISE  HALF A MILLION, TWO MILLION. WE END UP RAISING ALMOST $6 MILLION. AND I GOT BAD PUBLICITY. CAN YOU IMAGINE? THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN TO ME.  I HAVE MORE CALLS AND MORE E-MAILS AND MORE TWEETS TWO -- @REALDONALDTRUMP. IF I TO EAT SOMETHING CNN AND , FOX SAYS DONALD TRUMP, I'M  SITTING THERE TWEETING, DONALD TRUMP HAS ISSUED A MAJOR STATEMENT.  YOU KNOW WE HAVE LIKE ALMOST 9  MILLION ON TWITTER.  AND SIMILAR NUMBER ON FACEBOOK.  ON INSTAGRAM, A MILLION AND A  HALF AND SOON GOING TO BE 20  MILLION PEOPLE.  THAT'S LIKE OWNING THE ""NEW YORK  TIMES"" WITHOUT THE LAWSUITS.  AND THEN THEY SAY, YOU SHOULDN'T -- MY OPPONENTS, THEY HAVE THREE  PEOPLE, THEY SAID YOU SHOULDN'T  USE YOUR TWITTER.  I SAY WHY? THAT'S LIKE IN GOLF DON'T USE , YOUR DRIVER.  WE USE ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO DO  TO WIN.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN.  WE GOT TO WIN. BUT IT'S TRUE.  WE RAISED ALMOST $6 MILLION AND  THE DISHONEST PRESS, AND THEY  ARE SO DISHONEST, NOT ALL OF  THEM BUT MANY OF THEM, THEY ARE  SO DISHONEST, IF I WOULD HAVE  DONE NOTHING, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE.  I SAID LET'S RAISE SOME MONEY  FOR THE VETS.  I'M GLAD I DID IT.  I GOT MORE THANK U.S. FROM THE -- THANK YOUS FROM THE VETS.  WE GAVE TO MANY, MANY GROUPS.  THEY WAKE UP AND GET $100,000 IN  THE MAIL, $250,000. ONE OF THEM GOT $1.1 MILLION AND  THEY ARE GREAT.  THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE AND THEY  APPRECIATED IT.  BUT THEY PUT THE NEGATIVE SPIN  ON EVERYTHING.  NO MATTER WHAT WE DO -- YOU KNOW  IT'S FUNNY.  THE ""NEW YORK TIMES"" PUTS ME ON -- GET A MEDIC, PLEASE. OK.  YOU JUST TAKE IT EASY, DARLING.  IT'S HOT OUT HERE, RIGHT. RIGHT OVER HERE, MEDIC.  RIGHT OVER HERE.  WE LOVE YOU.  WE LOVE YOU.  SOME OF THESE PEOPLE GOT HERE  FIVE, SIX HOURS AGO.  HOW'S THAT?   SHE OK? WE WANT TO MAKE SURE SHE'S OK. SHE WAS HERE FOR FIVE HOURS, THEY SAY. FIVE HOURS, SOME OF THEM HERE FOR SEVEN, EIGHT HOURS. WE LOVE YOU. ARE YOU OK, HONEY? GIVE HER A HAND, EVERYBODY. GIVE HER A HAND.   THAT'S GREAT. SHE'S TOUGHER THAN ALL OF US. AND LOOK AT THE MEDICS AND THE POLICE, WHAT A GREAT JOB THEY DO, RIGHT?   E.M.T.'S.  GIVE THEM A HAND, BY THE WAY.  GREAT JOB.  THANK YOU, DARLING.  SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE'S IN GOOD  SHAPE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  THAT'S TRUE, THE POLICE, THE  MEDICS, FIREMEN AND THE JOB THEY  DO AND THEY ARE NOT APPRECIATED.  THEY ARE GOING TO BE APPRECIATED AGAIN, FOLKS.  IS SHE GOOD? EVERYTHING GOOD?  THAT'S GOOD.  THAT'S GOOD.  THANK YOU, HONEY.  SO WE'RE GOING TO DO THINGS THAT  HAVEN'T BEEN DONE IN A LONG TIME.  WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN.  WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE.  WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE.  EVEN A REPORT THAT YOU SEE, IT  WAS LIKE A BOMBSHELL. THEY EXPECTED 150,000 JOBS.  TURNS OUT TO BE 38,000 JOBS.  AND THEY ARE BAD JOBS.  PEOPLE SAY WE DON'T HAVE GOOD  JOBS.  OUR GOOD JOBS ARE MOVING TO  MEXICO ALONG WITH THE COMPANIES THAT ARE MOVING THERE. THEY ARE MOVING TO CHINA WHERE CHINA IS MAKING ALL OUR PRODUCTS AND DEVALUING THEIR CURRENCY. I HAD A MEETING TODAY AND MUST  HAVE HAD 50 CHINESE PEOPLE. PEOPLE FROM CHINA OR FORMERLY FROM CHINA. AND THEY ALL LOVE TRUMP. AND CNN WAS THERE, JAKE TAPPER WAS THERE AND WE HAD AN AMAZING TIME. AND JOHN DICKERSON, ALSO A GOOD GUY, HE WAS THERE FROM CBS AND THEY LOOKED OUTSIDE AND SAID WHO ARE ALL THOSE PEOPLE.  PEOPLE FROM CHINA THAT ARE  ENDORSING TRUMP. AND NOBODY COULD BELIEVE IT. I DON'T BLAME THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.  AND I DON'T BLAME THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT. I WANT OUR GOVERNMENT TO BE SMART.  I WANT OUR GOVERNMENT TO GET AWAY WITH THE KIND OF THINGS THEY GET AWAY WITH. BUT WE HAVE LEADERS THAT DON'T HAVE A CLUE. AND HILLARY CLINTON'S AT THE TOP  OF THE LIST. SHE'S INCOMPETENT.  LET'S FACE IT. FIRST OF ALL, SHE'S ALWAYS GOT PROBLEMS, WHITEWATER,  IMPEACHMENT, LIE, HE DIDN'T HAVE  SEX WITH THAT WOMAN.  TWO MONTHS LATER, HE'S WELL, HE DIDN'T.  THESE ARE LYING PEOPLE.  WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER FOUR YEARS  OF THE CLINTONS.  IT'S A MESS.  IT'S A MESS.  SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE  ARE GOING TO HAVE A STRONG  TEMPERMENT, NOT THAT WEAK TEMPERMENT.  I DON'T LIKE HIS TEMPERMENT. I DON'T LIKE HIS TONE.  THERE IS NOBODY WAS A BETTER  TEMPERAMENT THAN ME.  I HAVE A TEMPERAMENT FOR WINNING.  I HAVE WON ALL MY LIFE, AND WE  ARE GOING TO START WINNING FOR  YOU.  TEMPERMENT IS VERY IMPORTANT.  IT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT.  BUT WE NEED STRENGTH.  WE DON'T NEED THESE WEAK PEOPLE.  THEY TALK ABOUT, WELL, I THINK  HIS TEMPERMENT ISN'T GOOD.  I GUESS THEY DO POLLS.  THEY SAY HOW CAN WE GET TRUMP. I BELIEVE I HAVE THE GREATEST  TEMPERMENT THERE IS AND THE  TEMPERMENT THAT THIS COUNTRY  NEEDS AT THIS TIME.  I COULD SLOUGH IT OFF AND SAY,  I HAVE A WONDERFUL TEMPERAMENT. I'M A WONDERFUL PERSON. I HAVE A TOUGH TEMPERAMENT. BUT WE NEED A TOUGH TEMPERAMENT. WE NEED A TOUGH TEMPERAMENT. NOW, MY TEMPERAMENT IS TOTALLY CONTROLLED, SO BEAUTIFUL. I BUILT AN UNBELIEVABLE COMPANY. I DID SO MANY GREAT THINGS. I JUST READ ABOUT A SCHOOL WHERE  THE CLINTONS ARE INVOLVED THAT  GOT $16 MILLION, AND IT IS A  SCAM. WHY AREN'T THEY SUED? THEY SCAMMED THE SCHOOL. WHY AREN'T THEY BEING SUED?  IT'S A BIG STORY, BUT THESE  PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT  IT. TEMPERAMENT IS A VERY IMPORTANT  WORD. WE NEED TOUGHNESS IN TOWN. WE NEED TOUGHNESS IN  TEMPERAMENT. FRANKLY, I REALLY BELIEVE THIS, I THINK THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS  UNFIT TO LEAD OUR COUNTRY,  CERTAINLY AT THIS TIME. I THINK SHE'S UNFIT. SHE DOESN'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES. YOU ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH FOUR  MORE YEARS -- I CALL HER OBAMA LIGHT. IT WILL BE AT LEAST AS BAD, AND  MAYBE WORSE. THINK ABOUT WHAT I SAID.  THEY ARE SCAMMING US WITH CYBER,  LIVING IN A CYBER WORLD, AND  HERE SHE IS ALL SCREWED UP WITH  THE E-MAILS. SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE HECK  IS GOING ON. YOU TALK ABOUT COMPOSURE. YOU TALK ABOUT TEMPERAMENT. YOU TALK ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS. WHO WOULD BE SO STUPID, TO DO  WHAT SHE DID WITH HER E-MAILS?  I MEAN, WHO WOULD BE SO STUPID? SO WE ARE GOING TO TURN THIS COUNTRY AROUND. WE ARE GOING TO DO THINGS THAT  ARE GOING TO MAKE YOU SO PROUD  OF YOUR PRESIDENT, BUT MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY, SO PROUD OF YOUR COUNTRY AGAIN. BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE SAY, IDEAL  WITH ALL THESE COUNTRIES, I HAVE  GREAT DEALS IN ALL THESE COUNTRIES, SO MANY DEALS. THEY SAY, THEY LAUGH AT US. THEY SAY, WHAT'S GOING ON? THEY DON'T EVEN BELIEVE IT. EVEN THE PEOPLE FROM CHINA THIS MORNING, YOU WILL SEE BECAUSE I  THINK IT WILL BE ON CNN,  PROBABLY ON CBS, YOU'LL SEE,  THEY SAY, MR. TRUMP IS RIGHT. WE CAN'T, THEY CANNOT BELIEVE  WHAT THEY GET AWAY WITH. I HAVE THE LARGEST BANK IN THE  WORLD FROM CHINA, THE LARGEST  BANK IN THE WORLD, MASTER BANK,  A TENANT IN ONE OF MY BUILDINGS. I KNOW THE PEOPLE. THEY ARE SORT OF FRIENDS OF  MINE.  THEY TELL ME, WE DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN WAY WITH THIS.  THEY KNOW ME. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY KNOW I WILL  BE REVIEWING THIS, BUT THEY SAY,  WE CAN'T BELIEVE, WE CAN'T  BELIEVE WE GET AWAY WITH IT. SO WE ARE GOING TO TURN IT  AROUND. NOW, A COUPLE OF THINGS. WE NEED STRONG BORDERS.  YOU GOT TO HAVE BORDERS. EITHER THAT, OR WE DON'T HAVE A  COUNTRY. 16,500 BORDER PATROL AGENTS TWO  WEEKS AGO ENDORSED ME.  THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE EVER  ENDORSED A PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE.  I ASKED, WHAT PERFECT ROOM TO ASK, AS OPPOSED TO SOME CONSULTANT WHO WANTS TO SUCK YOU  DRY WITH FEES. THEY KNOW LESS THAN THAT  BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN STANDING  THERE. ALL THEY KNOW IS HOW TO GET  FEES. I ASKED, LET ME ASK YOU, HOW IMPORTANT IS THE WALL?  TELL ME, HOW IMPORTANT IS THE  WALL? I FEEL BETTER ABOUT IT.  THEY SAID, IT'S VITAL, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF STOPPING THE DRUG TRAFFIC POURING THROUGH  THE BORDERS.  BUT A REAL WELL. YOU SEE THE WALL THEY HAVE? THEY TAKE A POGO STICK AND THEY  GO RIGHT OVER THE WALL. THEY ACTUALLY BUILT A LITTLE  RANT, AND THEY GO OVER IT WITH A  CAR LOADED UP WITH DRUGS, THEN COME BACK OVER THE SAME RAMP. THERE WON'T BE ANY RAMP WITH MY WALL, FOLKS. IT WILL BE A SERIOUS WALL. A REAL DEAL WILL. IT WILL BE WAY UP THERE. A BIG, BEAUTIFUL WALL. MAYBE SOMEDAY THEY WILL NAME IT  AFTER TRUMP, BUT I WOULD MUCH  RATHER HAVE A STATUE IN  WASHINGTON, D C. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD THAT WILL. MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE  WALL. WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT WITH MEXICO OF $50 BILLION A YEAR. $58 BILLION. THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE DRUGS  POURING ACROSS THE BORDER. YET WE HAVE COMPANIES MOVING  INTO MEXICO. THEY JUST TOOK THE WORLD GOLF  CHAMPIONSHIP AT OF MIAMI AND  BROUGHT IT TO MEXICO, AND PEOPLE  OF MIAMI ARE FURIOUS. THEY BROUGHT IT INTO MEXICO, SIGNING A SIX-YEAR DEAL.  THEY TAKE EVERYTHING, BECAUSE WE  ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN. BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW IT. I USED THE EXAMPLE OF CARRIER  AIR-CONDITIONING IN INDIANA. WE WON INDIANA BIG. THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE  FIREWALL FOR OTHER PEOPLE RUNNING, AND IT WAS A FIREWALL  FOR ME.  I WON A LANDSLIDE.  THANK YOU, BOBBY KNIGHT. AND OTHERS. WE HAD INCREDIBLE, INCREDIBLE SUPPORT. SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE I KNEW I WAS GOING TO WIN  INDIANA. I THINK, LET'S SAY TED CRUZ, IT  WOULD NOT BE HERE RIGHT NOW. THEY GIVE UP -- ALWAYS GIVE UP.  I THINK WE CAN WIN. WE ARE GOING AFTER CALIFORNIA,  WE ARE GOING AFTER THE STATE OF  WASHINGTON, WE ARE GOING AFTER  PLACES THAT NO OTHER REPUBLICAN  GOES AFTER. WE HAVE A HIT OF A TIGHTER HALF.  IF WE DO NOT WIN THEM IT IS  OVER.  WHEREAS THE DEMOCRATS CAN LOSE  NUMEROUS STATES AND THEY CAN WIN  SO WE HAVE A TIGHTER PATH BUT I  AM NOT YOUR TYPICAL PERSON. WHEN WE COME OUT WE HAVE 31,000  PEOPLE. THEY HARDLY SHOWED THAT BECAUSE  THAT WAS THE DAY THE KID WAS  JUMPING ON THE POLICE CAR BREAKING THE HELL OUT OF IT. THEY PROBABLY DID NOT ARREST  HIM.  WHO IS TOUGHER AT THE BORDER,  BETWEEN THAT AND THE BORDER  PATROL BUT SHERIFF JOE TOTALLY  ENDORSED ME.  NO ONE TOUGHER THAN SHERIFF JOE.  THEY HAD A COUPLE OF PEOPLE PROTESTING, THEY PUT THOSE PEOPLE IN JAIL SO FAST EVERYONE ELSE SCATTERED.  I SAID THAT IS THE WAY IT HAS TO  BE DONE.  THAT IS THE WAY IT HAS TO BE  DONE. WE NEED STRENGTHEN OUR COUNTRY  AND I SEE IT BUT THE THUGS LAST NIGHT IN SAN JOSE AND THEN THE DEMOCRATIC MAYOR GETS UP AND I GUESS SHE SAID I THINK IT WAS DONALD TRUMP. WHEN WE HAVE A PROTESTER INSIDE  WHICH IS NOT VERY OFTEN I SAY A  VERY GENTLE. PLEASE DO NOT HEARD HIM.  TAKE CARE FROM AND HE WANTS TO  SHOUT. IF HE PUNCHES YOU IN THE FACE SMILE IS -- AS YOUR NOSE IS  POURING BLOOD OUT OF IT. A VERY NICE.  WE HAD A CASE WHERE WE HAD AN  AFRICAN AMERICAN GUY WHO WAS A  FAN OF MINE, GREAT FAN, GREAT  GUY. I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH HIM.  LOOK AT MY AFRICAN AMERICAN OVER  HERE, LOOK AT HIM. ARE YOU THE GREATEST? YOU KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT ?  OK. WE HAVE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN GUY AT ONE OF THE RALLIES AND HE IS  SITTING THERE BEHAVING AND WE  HAD PROTESTERS INSIDE THE ARENA. THEY WERE DRESSED IN A KU KLUX KLAN OUTFIT AND THEY ARE RUNNING AROUND DRESSED AS THE KLAN AND THE PLACES BOEING.  THIS AFRICAN-AMERICAN GETS UP  AND HE SLUGS THESE GUYS. BY THAT TIME THEIR HAT WAS OFF  BECAUSE IT GOT RIPPED OFF  BECAUSE THEY WERE RUNNING UP THE  STAIRS BUT THIS GUY, A GREAT GUY, I THINK HE WAS A MILITARY  GUY FOR A LONG TIME.  HE SLUGGED THIS GUY WEARING THE KU KLUX KLAN OUTFIT.  BY THE TIME HE GOT UP TO THE TOP  YOU COULD NOT SEE IT WAS A COOK -- KU KLUX KLAN OUTFIT, WHEN THE  AFRICAN-AMERICAN COLD COCKED THIS GUY, IT WAS LIKE THIS GREAT GUY, WE HAVE TREMENDOUS  AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPPORT.  THE REASON IS I WILL BRING JOBS  BACK TO OUR COUNTRY. WE WILL BRING JOBS BACK BUT WHEN THESE SLEAZY PEOPLE, THESE  DISHONEST PEOPLE WHO NEVER  SHOWED THE CROWD, WHEN THEY SHOWED THAT EVENT, IT MADE IT LOOK LIKE THE WHITE GUY WAS ON MY SIDE. THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN GUY SAID, I HAD ENOUGH AND NO ONE IS GOING TO RUN THROUGH AN ARENA LIKE THAT AND THEY REVERSED IT AND IT  IS A DISGRACE, OK? ME TELL YOU WELL WE ARE ON THE SUBJECT WE'RE GOING TO BRING JOBS BACK TO THIS COUNTRY. WE NEED OUR JOBS.  WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT VERY EXPENSIVE FOR COMPANIES TO FIRE  EVERYONE AND LEAVE. YOUR AREA HAS LOST ONE IN THREE MANUFACTURING JOBS OVER A FAIRLY  SHORT TIME. THAT IS A LOT OF MANUFACTURING JOBS.  YOUR CRIME RATE IS WAY THE HELL UP.  WHEN I GO TO CONNECTICUT, LANDSLIDE.  MARYLAND, LANDSLIDE.  RHODE ISLAND, LANDSLIDE.  DELAWARE, LANDSLIDE.  THE WEEK BEFORE THAT WE HAD NEW  YORK, SUPER LANDSLIDE. THEY KNOW ME IN NEW YORK.  WE HAVE THREE PEOPLE RUNNING.  I GOT 62%.  I WON SO MUCH THAT PEOPLE COULD  NOT BELIEVE IT.  WAY ABOVE PROJECTIONS, I KNEW I  WAS GOING TO WIN. EVEN FOR YOU, WITH THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW ME DO BEST, THEY GIVE ME A TREMENDOUS VOTE OF  CONFIDENCE, AND WE WON IT.  THEN YOU HAVE THESE GUYS, DONALD  TRUMP IS NOT AT 50%. I HAVE 12 PEOPLE RUNNING AGAINST ME IN SOME OF THESE STATES, RIGHT?  EVER NOTICE THAT? HERE IS A GUY, MR. TRUMP WILL NOT RUN. THIS IS THE FINEST FIELD OF TALENT EVER ASSEMBLED IN THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THAT WAS BEFORE I RAN. I LISTEN TO KRAUTHAMMER SAY THIS IS THE FINEST GROUP OF TALENT EVER ASSEMBLED IN THE HISTORY OF  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.  I LOOKED AT MY WIFE AND SAID,  MAYBE I SHOULD NOT RUN.  EXCEPT KRAUTHAMMER DOES NOT KNOW  WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.  HE IS OVERPAID.  HE WAS THE BIG ONE FOR THE WAR.  GO INTO THE WAR.  GO INTO IRAQ.  FIGHT LIKE HELL.  LOSE THOUSANDS OF LIVES.  IT'S BEEN $2 TRILLION.  YOU KNOW WHAT WE GOT? NOTHING.  YOU KNOW WHAT WE DID?  WE GAVE IRAQ TO IRAN.  AND I HAVE BEEN AGAINST IT.  WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE ARE  GOING TO BUILD OUR MILITARY SO  POWERFUL, SO STRONG, NOBODY IS  GOING TO MESS WITH US.  OUR MILITARY IS TO PLEADED. -- DEPLETED.  DID YOU SEE THOSE THINGS ON FOX  AND CNN WHERE THEY HAD A SORT OF  DOCUMENTARY ON WHAT IS GOING ON  WITH OUR FLYERS, RIGHT?  WE HAVE THESE GREAT AIRMEN. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH OUR EQUIPMENT?  OUR F-16S, F-18S, THEY HAVE THE  FIGHTERS, BUT THEY DON'T HAVE  PARTS, SO THEY GO INTO A PLANE  GRAVEYARD WHERE THEY DUMP THE  OLD PLANES AND THEY ARE STEALING  PARTS FOR OUR FIGHTER JETS.  AND THEY ARE STEALING PARTS FROM  MUSEUMS, THEY ARE GOING IN AND  TAKING PARTS BECAUSE THEY WANT  TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO FLY.  THIS IS THE UNITED STATES.  CAN YOU IMAGINE THEM DOING THAT?  AND THEN THEY SPOKE TO THESE  YOUNG PILOTS, THESE GREAT GUYS,  AND SAID, WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?  THEY ARE LEAVING.  AS SOON AS THEIR TERM IS UP,  THEY ARE LEAVING.  THEY REMEMBER HOW GREAT IT WAS  15 YEARS AGO WHEN THEY STARTED.  THIS IS THE UNITED STATES,  FOLKS, AND WE ARE NEVER GOING TO  BE DOING THAT KIND OF THING  AGAIN IF I AM PRESIDENT, I TELL  YOU RIGHT NOW.  I TELL YOU RIGHT NOW.  SO WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO DO  AND WE ARE GOING TO DO THINGS  THE RIGHT WAY.  WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS  CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY.

SHE IS GREEDY.  SHE IS GREEDY AS HELL BUT, SHE  DOES NOT HAVE THE TALENT FOR THE  JOB.  SHE IS NOT A NATURAL FOR THE  JOB, AND SHE IS JUST NOT A  NATURAL TALENT.  HONESTLY, FOLKS, LOOK, BEYOND  ME, IF YOU CHOOSE A HILLARY  CLINTON, THIS COUNTRY IS GOING  TO DIE.  IT IS GOING TO DIE.  SHE IS NOT RESPECTED BY OTHER  COUNTRIES.  AS AN EXAMPLE, WHEN I SAID  JAPAN, LOOK, WE MAY HAVE TO  WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS  CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY.  VISIT NCICAP.ORG]  WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS  CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY.

NOT ONCE DID THIS STIFF, JOHN KERRY, NOT ONCE DID HE GET UP  FROM THE BARGAINING TABLE AND SAY SORRY, FOLKS, YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.  LEAVE THE ROOM, DOUBLE UP THE  SANCTIONS.  THEY WOULD HAVE CALLED HIM  WITHIN 24 HOURS. AND BY THE WAY, THE BIGGEST LOSER IN THAT DEAL ASIDE FROM US IS ISRAEL. ISRAEL IS BESIDE THEMSELVES OVER  THAT DEAL.  THAT DEAL IS A DISASTER FOR  ISRAEL AND THE MIDDLE EAST,  BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE COUNTRIES  NOW START TO ARM UP AND ARM UP BIG.  IT IS A DISASTER.  THIS IS THE PRESIDENT WE HAVE.  I BELIEVE THAT HILLARY CLINTON  IS GOING TO BE WORSE THAN OBAMA, OK?  I BELIEVE SHE HAS LESS TALENT  THAN OBAMA.  SHE HAS LESS NATURAL ABILITY  THAN OBAMA.  AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT --,  BECAUSE HE DOESN'T.  HE HAS AN AGENDA, FOLKS.  NOBODY COULD BE SO STUPID AND  MAKE DEALS LIKE THIS GUY IS MAKING.  REMEMBER THIS.  REMEMBER THIS.  OBAMA HAS BEEN TALKING LATELY,  TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, AND  NORMALLY I WOULD NOT WANT TO  ATTACK THE PRESIDENT. I WOULD NOT WANT TO SAY BAD.  I WOULD RATHER NOT.  HE STARTED SPEAKING.  NOW HE HAS BEEN VERY QUIET  LATELY, VERY QUIET.  YOU KNOW WHAT?  HE STARTED SPEAKING.  ONCE THE ATTACKS, WE ARE  ALLOWED. HE WILL GO OUT AND CAMPAIGN FOR HILLARY.  HILLARY HATES OBAMA, YOU KNOW  THAT? SHE HAS HATED HIM FOR YEARS. OBAMA CALLED BILL CLINTON A RACIST.  BILL CLINTON HATES OBAMA.  HE HATES OBAMA.  HATES HIM.  THE BIGGEST SURPRISE TO ME IS  THAT HE MADE THE SPEECH AT THE CONVENTION FOR HIM. HONESTLY, BECAUSE HE HATES OBAMA. HILLARY CLINTON CAN'T STAND  OBAMA, BUT NOW HILLARY WILL DO  ANYTHING HE SAYS.  YOU KNOW WHY? SHE DOES NOT WANT TO GO TO JAIL. YOU NOTICE?  ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY WERE GOING  TO DISASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH  THE PRESIDENT. ALL OF A SUDDEN ANYTHING HE  WANTS, SHE WILL DO, BECAUSE IT  SEEMS -- LET'S TAKE THE WORD ""SEEMS"" OUT. THEY ARE PROTECTING HER FROM GOING TO JAIL.  AND SHE DOES NOT WANT TO ANGER  THE PRESIDENT BY SAYING, I DISAGREE WITH YOU ON THIS TRADE,  SO SHE AGREES WITH JUST ABOUT  EVERY SINGLE THING THAT HE WANTS  TO DO.  YES, SIR.  NO, SIR.  I THINK SHE SHOULD START CALLING  HIM SIR, OK?  AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING, FOLKS.  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A WHOLE  DIFFERENT THING. REMEMBER THIS ABOUT OBAMA.  I ALWAYS THOUGHT ONE THING, I  NEVER THOUGHT HE'D BE A GOOD  PRESIDENT. I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER.  I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO BE A  GOOD CHEERLEADER.  HE HAS BEEN A DISASTER  CHEERLEADER.  NO, NO, I KNOW WHAT SHE SAID.  IT'S, YOU KNOW, HEY, A LOT OF  PEOPLE SAY THAT, BY THE WAY, BUT  I THOUGHT IT WOULD BRING THE  COUNTRY TOGETHER.  SHE CAN'T BRING THE COUNTRY  TOGETHER. IT'S NOT THERE.  HE'S DIVIDED THE COUNTRY. WEALTHY, EIGHT LESS THAN  WEALTHY, WHITE, BLACK, HE HAS  BEEN THE GREAT DIVIDER.  HE HAS BEEN A TERRIBLE  PRESIDENT.  HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE WORSE,  BELIEVE ME.  SHE WILL BE WORSE. SHE IS GOING TO BE WORSE. SHE HAS A CHANCE OF BEING FAR WORSE. LOOK AT THE LIBYA DEAL.  LOOK AT IT.  YOU KNOW IT'S AMONG THE FINEST OILS IN THE WORLD, RIGHT? IT IS ONE OF THE FINE OILS IN  THE WORLD. YOU KNOW WHAT?  ISIS HAS IT. I MET WITH THE FIANCEE OF THE  AMBASSADOR WHO WAS KILLED. YESTERDAY, SHE IS SUPPORTING  TRUMP, A VERY NICE WOMAN, AND  SHE TELLS ME STORIES ABOUT  HILLARY THAT ARE UNBELIEVABLE, UNBELIEVABLE, HORRIBLE STORIES  ABOUT HILLARY.  I SAID, ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU  ARE SUPPORTING ME?  I THOUGHT SHE WOULD BE ON THE  DEMOCRAT SIDE.  SHE SAID, I AM SUPPORTING YOU,  BUT SHE TOLD ME STORIES ABOUT  HILLARY THAT ARE HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE.  SHE SAID THE AMBASSADOR WAS LIKE  A GREAT GUY.  WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH WAS  SUPPOSED TO BE BEYOND  COMPREHENSION, INCLUDING THE  OTHER THREE YOUNG PEOPLE. AND REMEMBER THE ADS, THE PHONY  ADS WITH HILLARY, WHO DO YOU WANT ANSWERING YOUR PHONE AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING.  SHE WAS SLEEPING. SHE WAS SLEEPING.  SHE WAS SOUND ASLEEP, OR WHO  KNOWS, BUT SHE DID NOT ANSWER  THE PHONE.  I SAY SHE WAS SLEEPING. I SAY SHE WAS SLEEPING, BECAUSE SHE HAS NO ENERGY.  I SAY SHE WAS SLEEPING, ALL RIGHT?  YOU KNOW, I SAY WAS A TERRIBLE THING.  AND BENGHAZI HAS NEVER REALLY  BEEN PICKED UP LIKE IT SHOULD BE  PICKED UP BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT  NEVER PICKED IT UP.  IT IS AN HONOR YOU ARE HERE IN  THIS KIND OF HEAT.  I KNOW A NUMBER OF YOU WENT DOWN.  I LOVE YOU ALL.  YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY AND  SO PROUD.  YOU HAVE TO GO OUT ON JUNE 7.  YOU HAVE GOT TO GO OUT.  YOU HAVE GOT TO VOTE.  BECAUSE WE ARE SENDING A MANDATE. WE ALREADY WON, AND WE ARE NOW AHEAD BY MILLIONS AND MILLIONS ABOVE THE PEOPLE THAT CAME IN SECOND.  I WON'T EVEN TELL YOU WHO IT IS.  WE ARE AHEAD BY MILLIONS. THE BIGGER MANDATE WE HAVE, THE STRONGER THE MOVEMENT WILL BE. AND MOST IMPORTANT, GET EVERYONE OF YOUR FRIENDS, AND IN NOVEMBER, YOU HAVE TO VOTE.  I WILL BE BACK.  I WILL BE BACK. IN NOVEMBER, IN NOVEMBER, YOU  HAVE TO GO AND VOTE. LET ME JUST TELL YOU, WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH OUR MILITARY.  AND WE ARE GOING TO KNOCK THE  HELL OUT OF ISIS. AND IT'S GOING TO GO A LOT  FASTER AND A LOT EASIER THAN  PEOPLE UNDERSTAND.  WE ARE GOING TO KNOCK THE HELL  OUT OF THEM.  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE STRONG  BORDERS.  WE WILL HAVE THE WALL.  WE WILL BE PROUD OF OUR COUNTRY AGAIN.  WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL OBAMA CARE.  60%, THINK OF IT, IN TEXAS, 60%  BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD. 60.  IT'S GOING TO BE WORSE FOR OTHER  SECTIONS.  AND DON'T LET THEM TAKE THAT  NOVEMBER 1 ANNOUNCEMENT AND MAKE  IT DECEMBER, BECAUSE THAT ALONE  WILL DESTROY THEIR CHANCES OF  WINNING THE PRESIDENCY.  REMEMBER, DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN,  BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IT.  THEY WANT TO HAVE A LATER  ANNOUNCEMENT DATE.  SO WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING  WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS  OF LIFE AND OUR COUNTRY. WE WILL SAVE OUR SECOND  AMENDMENT. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO ABOLISH IT.  SHE WANTS TO ABOLISH OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. WE ARE GOING TO SAVE OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. WE ARE GOING TO WIN.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN AT EVERY  SINGLE LEVEL.  I JOKE, I JOKE, AND I HAVE FUN,  BUT IT IS NOT A JOKE WHEN WE ARE GOING TO WIN, WIN, WIN.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH,  THREE OR FOUR FRIENDS, GREAT  FRIENDS IN THE AUDIENCE, AND I  SAY THEY'RE GOING TO COME SEE ME  AT THE WHITE HOUSE, MR. PRESIDENT, SIR, WE ARE WINNING TOO MUCH. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA DON'T WANT TO WIN SO DAMN MUCH, MR. PRESIDENT. PLEASE STOP THIS WINNING. WE ARE NOT USED TO IT AS A COUNTRY.  WE ARE USED TO LOSING ALL THE TIME. WE CAN HANDLE IT. I'M GOING TO SAY, I'M SORRY. WE ARE GOING TO WIN, WIN, WIN. WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH TRADE. WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH MILITARY. WE ARE GOING TO WIN BY GETTING  RID OF OBAMACARE AND REPLACING  IT.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN AT THE  BORDER. WE ARE GOING TO GET THE WALL. WE ARE GOING TO LET PEOPLE COME INTO THE COUNTRY, AND THEY'RE GOING TO COME LEGALLY.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH AND  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA  GREAT AGAIN. I THINK THEY WANT TO HELP EVERYBODY ELSE. THEY WANT TO HELP EVERYBODY BUT OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A POLICY OF  AMERICA FIRST, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  WE WILL DO IT.  GET OUT ON THE SEVENTH AND VOTE,  AND BOY, YOU BETTER VOTE IN  NOVEMBER.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.  THANK YOU.  WE LOVE YOU.  THANK YOU.      ","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Rally in Redding, California"

DURING THE EVENT, HE CHALLENGED THE MEDIA AND OTHER CRITICS FOR QUESTIONING THE DONATIONS. FROM TRUMP TOWER NEW YORK, THIS IS 40 MINUTES.   MR. TRUMP: THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. WE HAVE GONE THE NOMINATION. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLE APD IN CLEVELAND. WE STARTED WORKING ALREADY ON THE CONVENTION. AND LEBRON, GOOD LUCK IN THE SERIES BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE THE SERIES, WHICH OF COURSE, THE LONGER IT GOES, THE LESS TIME WE HAVE, BUT THAT'S OK. IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. AS YOU KNOW, THEY ARE PLAYING THE BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS PARTIALLY IN THAT ARENA. I THINK IT WILL BE VERY EXCITING, LENDING TO THE EXCITEMENT IN CLEVELAND. THAT'S GOOD OR IT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE AN EXCITING PERIOD OF TIME. WE HAVE, WE'VE DONE SOME AWFULLY GOOD WORK. I WAS JUST INFORMED, IT WAS CERTIFIED OUT, THAT WE'VE GOTTEN MORE VOTES THAN ANYBODY IN THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES, AND WE STILL HAVE I GUESS SIX OR SEVEN LOCATIONS TO GO, STATES TO GO. AND IN THE HISTORY, THINK OF IT. IN TO THE HISTORY OF THIS GREAT PARTY, WE'VE GOTTEN SUBSTANTIALLY MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE, BY MILLIONS. BY MILLIONS MORE THAN ANYBODY WHO'S EVER RUN. WHEN YOU THINK DWIGHT EISENHOWER AND RONALD REAGAN, EVERYBODY, WE HAVE THE MOST VOTES BY FAR. THAT'S SOMETHING, TO ME, THAT'S VERY EXCITING. AND OVERALL IT'S JUST WITHIN A VERY EXCITING PROCESS. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO VERY WELL. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE, BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY HAVING DIFFICULTY. I DON'T LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE HAVING DIFFICULTY, BUT ANYBODY HAS TO HAVE IT, LET IT BE THEM. AND IT'S GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING. BUT I'M VERY PROUD TO SAY WE'VE GOTTEN THE MOST VOTES. ALSO IF YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL PRIMARY, THE AMOUNT OF VOTES CAST, THAT'S ALSO A RECORD. SO WE'VE BROKEN A LOT OF RECORDS IN TERMS OF THE VOTERS. OUR POLLING HAS COME OUT, AND THE POLLS ARE DOING VERY WELL. AS YOU KNOW, WE'RE PRETTY MUCH EVEN AND IN SOME CASES AHEAD OF HILLARY. AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A VERY, VERY SUCCESSFUL NUMBER OF MONTHS. AND I THINK IT WILL ALL CULMINATE IN NOVEMBER, AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, OK? SO THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS? YES, YES. >> THE LAST FOUR MONTHS ABOUT QUESTIONS -- YEAH. WHO GOT THAT MONEY?  OK. OK. I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THE QUESTION, BECAUSE I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I HAVE RAISED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THE VETS, ALMOST $6 MILLION, AND MORE MONEY IS GOING TO COME IN, I BELIEVE, OVER THE NEXT LITTLE WHILE TOO. BUT I'VE RAISED ALMOST $6 MILLION. ALL OF THE MONEY HAS BEEN PAID OUT. AND I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU IN A SECOND. IN FACT, I BROUGHT A LIST JUST IN CASE THAT QUESTION WAS ASKED. BUT THE MONEY HAS BEEN PAID OUT. I HAVE BEEN THANKED BY SO MANY VETERANS' GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. ONE GENTLEMAN CALLED ME UP RECENTLY CRYING THAT OUT OF THE BLUE HE GOT A CHECK FOR $100,000. BUT I'VE BEEN THANKED BY SO MANY GROUPS, GREAT VETERANS GROUPS. OUTSIDE YOU HAVE A, GROUPS. OUTSIDE YOU HAVE A FEW PEOPLE PICKETING, THEY'RE SENT BY HILLARY CLINTON, AND THEY'RE PICKETING THAT THE MONEY WASN'T SENT. THE MONEY'S ALL BEEN SENT. I WANTED TO KEEP IT PRIVATE. IF WE COULD, WE WANTED TO KEEP IT PRIVATE. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S ANYBODY'S BUSINESS IF I WANT TO SEND MONEY TO THE VETS. I RAISED CLOSE TO $6 MILLION. IT'LL PROBABLY BE OVER THAT AMOUNT WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE. BUT AS OF THIS MOMENT, IT'S $5.6 MILLION. WHEN IT STARTED, THIS STARTED WITH A SPEECH IN IOWA WHEN I SAID LET'S RAISE SOME MONEY FOR THE VETS. AND IT WENT UP FROM A MILLION DOLLARS TO $2 MILLION TO $3 MILLION. AND IT NOW ADDS UP TO BE ALMOST $6 MILLION AND, AGAIN, I THINK WE CAN EVEN DO BETTER THAN THAT. BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE PRESS SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES. AND ON BEHALF OF THE EVENTS, THE -- THE VETS, PRESS SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES. THEY ARE CALLING ME X. THEY ARE FURIOUS BECAUSE I SENT PEOPLE CHECKS OF A LOT OF MONEY, AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE NAMES RIGHT NOW WHICH IS WHAT YOU WANT. AND INSTEAD OF BEING LIKE THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. TRUMP, OR TRUMP DID A GOOD JOB, EVERYONE SAID WHO GOT IT, WHO GOT IT, WHO GOT IT, AND YOU MAKE ME LOOK VERY BAD. I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED SUCH BAD PUBLICITY FOR DOING SUCH A GOOD JOB. SO I WILL GIVE YOU THE NAMES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, RIGHT? OK. ARE YOU READY? I BROUGHT THEM HERE. IT TAKES, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO VET, YOU KNOW, MUCH OF THIS MONEY WAS PAID OUT VERY EARLY. BUT YOU HAVE TO VET ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT GROUPS BECAUSE THESE ARE MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS. YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS. WHEN YOU SEND CHECKS FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO PEOPLE AND TO COMPANIES AND TO GROUPS THAT YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF, CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS, YOU HAVE TO VET IT. YOU SEND PEOPLE OUT, YOU DO A LOT OF WORK. NOW, MOST OF THE MONEY WENT OUT QUITE A WHILE AGO. SOME OF IT WENT OUT MORE RECENTLY. BUT ALL OF THIS HAS GONE OUT, AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE NAMES. ARE YOU READY? DO YOU HAVE YOUR PAD? AND, AGAIN, I REALLY THINK THE PRESS, LOOK, THE MEDIA, YOU KNOW MY OPINION OF THE MEDIA, IT'S VERY LOW. I THINK THE MEDIA IS, FRANKLY, MADE UP OF PEOPLE IN MANY CASES, NOT IN ALL CASES, ARE NOT GOOD PEOPLE. BUT I THINK THIS IS AN EXAMPLE. AND I JUST ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE WORKED HARD ON THIS AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE MADE CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDING MYSELF, I GAVE A MILLION DOLLARS, BUT I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE SO THANKFUL FOR WHAT WE DID. ONE OTHER THING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW, IT'S ZERO DOLLARS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT FOR ADMINISTRATION. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GO TO A LOT OF THESE DIFFERENT GROUPS, IN THIS CASE ZERO DOLLARS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT FOR ADMINISTRATION. SO A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES THAT MAKE A LOT OF MONEY WITH DOING THE ADMINISTRATION STUFF. SO NO MONEY, IT COST ZERO DOLLARS TO ACCUMULATE ALL OF THIS MONEY, OK? SO YOU HAVE 22, AND THAT'S $200,000. YOU CAN CALL THESE PEOPLE. THAT WAS ANOTHER THING. A LOT OF THE MONEY WHEN IT WAS SENT OUT, DIFFERENT PEOPLE WOULD CALL. I CAN TELL YOU, I'M NOT GOING TO MENTION ANYBODY SPECIFICALLY, BUT THERE WERE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE THAT WERE REALLY DISGUSTING. THEY'D CALL, AND THESE VET GROUPS, THEY DON'T GET A LOT OF CALLS FROM THE PRESS. MAYBE SOME OF THEM WOULD KEEP QUIET, OR THEY DIDN'T KNOW, OR THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO THE PRESS OR THEY DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE. SO IF THEY DIDN'T SAY THEY GOT THE MONEY, WHICH THEY ALL DID, 100%, ALL CERTIFIED CHECKS IF ANYONE WANTS TO SEE THE CERTIFIED CHECKS. BUT RATHER OR THAN SAYING COULD I SEE A CERTIFIED CHECK, THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE THAT ALWAYS TALK TO THE PRESS. MANY OF THEM DO TALK TO THE PRESS. I GUESS YOU FOUND $2 MILLION OR $2.5 MILLION. WELL, THE NUMBER IS $5.6 MILLION, AND IT'S GOING TO POSSIBLY GO ABOVE THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE SOME OTHER PEOPLE ARE COMING IN. READY? 22 KILL GOT $200,000. NOW, THESE ARE CHECKS THAT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED, THAT HAVE BEEN CASHED, THAT ARE NOW BEING USED TO HELP THE VETS. ACHILLES INTERNATIONAL, GREAT ORGANIZATION, $200,000. MUCH OF THIS MONEY WAS PAID A LONG TIME AGO. AMERICAN HERO ADVENTURES, $100,000. AMERICANS FOR EQUAL LIVING, $100,000. AMERICA'S VET DOGS, THE VETERAN K-9 CORPS INC., $75,000. AMVETS, $75,000. JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND, WHEN I DIDN'T DO THE FOX DEBATE, THE ONE FOX DEBATE BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK THEY TREATED ME RIGHT, BUT ACTUALLY THEY'VE BEEN EXTREMELY FAIR OVER THE LAST THREE OR FOUR MONTHS, I HAVE TO SAY THAT ABOUT FOX, BUT WHEN I DIDN'T DO THAT ONE EVENT, THE DEBATE, I GAVE A SPEECH. I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS WITH THE MONEY FOR THE VETS, BUT I DECIDED TO BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA. AND I HAD SOME VERY GENEROUS PEOPLE, CARL ICAHN GAVE HALF A MILLION DOLLARS, PHIL RUFFIN GAVE A MILLION, IKE PERLMUTTER GAVE A MILLION. WE RAISED A LOT OF MONEY, AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER JUST TO GIVE THE SPEECH. AND THE PROBLEM WITH THE PRESS, WHAT THEY DO IS THEY CONVINCE PEOPLE LIKE ME NOT TO DO IT, NOT TO GIVE MONEY TO DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE IT'S A LOT EASIER THAT WAY. ARMED SERVICES, YMCA OF THE UNITED STATES, $75,000. BOB WOODRUFF FAMILY FOUNDATION INC., THEY DO A GOOD JOB, $75,000. CENTRAL IOWA SHELTER AND SERVICES, THESE ARE ALL VET-RELATED, $100,000. CONNECTED WARRIORS INC., $75,000. DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS' CHARITABLE SERVICE TRUST, $115,000. FISHER HOUSE FOUNDATION, GREAT PEOPLE, $115,000. FOLDS OF HONOR FOUNDATION, $200,000. FOUNDATION FOR AMERICAN VETERANS, $75,000. FREEDOM ALLIANCE, $75,000. GREEN BERET FOUNDATION, $350,000. HIRE HEROES USA, $75,000. HOMES FOR OUR TROOPS, $50,000. AND JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND, WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO. THIS MONEY WAS RAISED DURING A LITTLE SPEECH THAT I MADE RATHER THAN DOING A DEBATE. THE ONE DEBATE I MISSED. IT WAS THE LOWEST RATED DEBATE, BY THE WAY, BUT I WON'T SAY THAT. HONORING AMERICA'S WARRIORS, $100,000. HOPE FOR THE WARRIORS, $65,000. INTREPID FALLEN HEROES FUND, $175,000. K-9S FOR WARRIORS, $50,000. LIBERTY HOUSE, $100,000. MARINE CORPS LAW ENFORCEMENT FOUNDATION, $1,100,000. I GAVE A MILLION DOLLARS TO THEM. THEY'RE A GREAT GROUP. NAVY SEAL FOUNDATION, $465,000. KNAVE MARINE CORPS, NAVY MARINE CORPS RELIEF SOCIETY, $75,000. NEW ENGLAND WOUNDED VETERANS INC., $75,000. OPERATION HOME FRONT, $65,000. PARTNERS FOR PATRIOTS, $100,000. PROJECT FOR PATRIOTS, AND WE'RE STILL VETTING THEM, BY THE WAY, THE CHECK IS READY TO TO GO BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ALL OF THEIR APPROPRIATE, IN FACT, WE HAVE DOWN HERE WILL BE RELEASED TO THEM UPON THE RECEIPT OF THE IRS DETERMINATION LETTER. IT'S THE ONLY ONE OR, WHICH WE HEAR THEY'RE FANTASTIC, BUT THEY HAVE TO GIVE US THAT FINAL DOCUMENT. THIS IS WHAT I MEAN BY VETTING. YOU HAVE TO HAVE ALL THE DOCUMENTS, OTHERWISE YOU CAN'T GIVE THEM THE MONEY. PROJECT FOR PATRIOTS, $100,000. PUPPY JAKE FOUNDATION, $100,000. RACING FOR HEROS INC., $200,000.

VETERANS COUNT, $25,000. VETERANS IN COMMAND INC., $150,000. VIETNAM VETERANS WORKSHOP INC., $75,000. WARRIORS FOR FREEDOM FOUNDATION, $50,000. AND I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME MORE COMING IN. SOME FRIENDS OF MINE, SOME MORE COMING IN. AND THAT ADDS UP TO $6 MILLION, WELL, LET'S SEE, THAT ADDS UP TO $5,600,000 TOTAL, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME MORE COMING IN. SO THAT'S IT.  NOW, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. EVERY ONE OF THOSE CHECKS HAS BEEN PASSED OTHER THAN THE ONE CHECK WHICH IS BEING HELD SUBJECT TO THEIR GETTING A FINAL APPROVAL FROM THE GOVERNMENT. BUT EVERY ONE OF THOSE CHECKS HAS BEEN PASSED. THIS IS MY CHECK FOR A MILLION DOLLARS. WE HAVE MANY LETTERS FROM THE DIFFERENT GROUPS THANK US VERY MUCH FOR THE MONEY. AND THEY DIDN'T ASK, AND I DIDN'T ASK PEOPLE TO BE HERE TODAY. I COULD HAVE ASKED EVERY ONE OF THE GROUPS, UNLIKE HILLARY WHO ASKED PEOPLE TO STAND OUTSIDE AND SAY, OH, DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T GIVE THE MONEY, NOBODY GAVE THIS KIND OF MONEY. SO I GAVE $5,600,000. MORE IS COMING IN, PROBABLY TOPS THE $6 MILLION NUMBER. I NEVER THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO RAISE A MILLION DOLLARS WHEN WE STARTED, AND WE ENDED UP DOING ALMOST $6 MILLION. SO I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THE PRESS IS SO DISHONEST AND SO UNFAIR. A LOT OF THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE OVER OR HERE HELPED IN VETTING THE VARIOUS REQUESTS FOR MONEY. AND I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF, JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF THESE PEOPLE. YES.  YEAH.  I WASN'T TOO INVOLVED IN PICKING THE ORGANIZATIONS OTHER THAN I GAVE A MILLION DOLLARS TO THE MARINE, THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEY ARE FABULOUS PEOPLE. THEY HONORED ME LAST YEAR AT THE WALDORF ASTORIA. I KNEW THEM. I WAS GOING TO GIVE TO THREE GROUPS, AND WE COULDN'T VET THEM QUICKLY ENOUGH. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THAT NUMBER, THE MARINE CORPS LAW ENFORCEMENT FOUNDATION IS A FABULOUS GROUP. I DIDN'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF HAVING TO THAT ALL THOSE GROUPS. BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE THIS OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS WITH THE PRESS IS ALL INVOLVED. THEN WE SAID WE WOULD. THEN WE SAID HOW MUCH IT WAS. WHEN THIS STARTED I THINK YOU WERE THERE. I SAID WE COULD RAISE A MILLION DOLLARS. WE ENDED UP RAISING ALMOST $6 MILLION. AND WE WILL HAVE MORE COMING IN OVER A PERIOD OF TIME.  I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE CREDIT FOR IT. WHAT I GOT WAS WORSE THAN CREDIT. THEY WERE QUESTIONING ME. MOST OF THAT MONEY WENT OUT VERY EARLY JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND. BUT A LOT OF THESE GROUPS, GETTING VETTED WHEN YOU PAY THE MONEY OUT YOU NEED GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTATION. THEY NEED A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. PLUS, WE WANT TO FIND OUT IF IT IS A GOOD GROUP. I HAD PEOPLE REVIEWING STATISTICS AND NUMBERS. ALSO PEOPLE FROM THE MILITARY TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE GROUP WAS DESERVING OF THE MONEY. WE HAVE GIVEN TO GROUPS THAT ARE UNBELIEVABLE GROUPS. I WISH YOU COULD HEAR THE PHONE CALLS AND SEE THE LETTERS. THEY ARE SO HAPPY. I AM HAPPY TO DO IT. I DIDN'T WANT CREDIT FOR IT BUT WAS VERY UNFAIR THAT THE PRESS SAID ABOUT US. YEAH, GO AHEAD.  GENERALLY SPEAKING, THAT IS 100% TRUE.  I LIKE SCRUTINY. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? WHEN I RAISE MONEY -- EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. I WATCHED YOU ON TELEVISION. YOU ARE A REAL BEAUTY. WHEN I RAISE MONEY FOR THE VETERANS AND IT IS A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY FIND OUT HOW MUCH HILLARY CLINTON HAS DONE NOTHING FOR THE VETERANS. NOTHING. I SEE A FEW GUYS STANDING OUT THERE. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY ARE THERE FOR. HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN SENT THEM. IT WAS ONE OF YOU GUYS IN THE PRESS THAT FOUND OUT THAT THEY WERE WITH HILLARY. BUT I WASN'T SURPRISED. I DON'T WANT TO GET CREDIT. BUT I SHOULDN'T BE LAMBASTED. AND REMEMBER THIS. SO OUT OF THE ALMOST $6 MILLION THAT WAS RAISED NOT ONE PENNY DID WE TAKE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION COSTS. THAT'S UNHEARD OF.  HOW ELSE AM I GOING TO RAISE THE MONEY?  AND SO I WAS CRITICIZED. I'M THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD TO RAISE $6 MILLION FOR THE VETERANS. I ENDED UP BEING CRITICIZED BY THE PRESS. I MADE A SPEECH AND DURING MY SPEECH I SAID I WOULD RAISE MONEY FOR THE VETERANS. IT TURNED OUT TO BE A LOT OF MONEY, NOT A LITTLE MONEY. I THOUGHT WE COULD GET TO A MILLION DOLLARS IT WOULD BE GREAT. WHICH IT WOULD'VE BEEN.  I DO RAISE MILLIONS.  I RAISED ALMOST $6 MILLION BUT MORE MONEY IS COMING THROUGH. WHEN WE'RE FINISHED IT WILL PROBABLY BE OVER THE $6 MILLION. I DON'T MIND IT COMING FROM THE OPPOSITION.  I DON'T MIND IT COMING FROM THE OPPOSITION. WHAT I DO MIND IS WHEN I RAISE ALL OF THIS MONEY AND NO RENEWAL BE OVER $5 MILLION. HERE'S THE STORY.  HERE'S THE STORY. I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THE PRESS FOR A LONG TIME. I THINK THE POLITICAL PRESS IS AMONG THE MOST DISHONEST PEOPLE I'VE EVER MET. I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT COME OK. OF COURSE YOU ARE EXCLUDED, CARL. YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE. I THINK THE POLITICAL PRESS -- I SEE THE STORIES. I SEE THE WAY THEY ARE COUCHED. FOR INSTANCE, I WENT DOWN THIS WEEKEND TO DO ROLLING THUNDER. I WAS INVITED. I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. WE HAD A TREMENDOUS GATHERING OF PEOPLE. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. I JOKED THAT WE WOULD GO FROM THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL TO THE LINCOLN. I WAS JOKING. THEY SAID DONALD TRUMP WAS DISAPPOINTED. EVERYBODY KNEW I WAS JOKING. THEY SAID TRUMP WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED BY THE CROWD. -- THAT IT DIDN'T GO FROM JEFFERSON TO LINCOLN. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. I WAS JOKING. THEY PUT IT DOWN A SERIOUS. THEY KNOW I WAS JOKING. I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE. WE HAD A -- THE SAME EVENT. IT WAS ROPED OFF WHERE YOU CAN ONLY GET SO MANY PEOPLE IN THERE. THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE. I DO KNOW, 10,000, 50 THOUSAND, MAYBE 25,000 PEOPLE. THEY WERE PEOPLE BREAKING THE SEAMS. GENE WASHINGTON, A MAN I LIKE, ONE ARTICLE THAT SAID THEY WERE 5000 PEOPLE THERE WERE MANY TIMES THAT. AND YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY MORE PEOPLE. ALL THESE PEOPLE WITH THEIR MOTORCYCLES IN PARKING LOTS AND THEY WERE WAITING FOR ME AS I'M GOING BY. THE LATER MINUTE. -- BUT WAIT A MINUTE. THE POINT IS LAW ENFORCEMENT DIDN'T ALLOW YOU TO HAVE ANY MORE PEOPLE. I HAD A TREMENDOUS CROWD THAT WAS THE BIGGEST CROWD YOU COULD HAVE HAD. BECAUSE IT WAS ALL CORDONED OFF. YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO HAVE MORE. YOU ARE NOT HAVE ANY MORE PEOPLE THAN THEY HAD. SO INSTEAD OF SAYING TRUMP MADE A SPEECH IN FRONT OF A PACKED CROWD, THEY SAID TRUMP MADE A SPEECH AND HE WAS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE GOING FROM JEFFERSON TO WASHINGTON. GIVE ME A BREAK. IT IS DISHONESTY.  THIS IS WHY THE VETERANS BELIEVE. THIS IS A GROUP I GAVE MONEY TO. HE JUST SHOWED UP I JUST SAW HIM. I COULD'VE ASKED ALL THESE GROUPS TO COME. I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT. I AM NOT LOOKING FOR CREDIT. WHAT I DON'T WANT IS WHEN I RAISE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO HAVE PEOPLE SAY, LIKE THIS SLEAZY GUY RIGHT OVER HERE FROM ABC. HE'S A SLEAZE. IN MY BOOK. YOU ARE A SLEAZE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE FACTS AND YOU KNOW THE FACTS WELL.  WHAT I DID IS -- I DIDN'T ASK AL -- I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE WE HAD GREAT VICTORIES. HE SHOWED UP THIS MORNING BECAUSE HE WAS UPSET AND MANY OF THE OTHER GROUPS ARE VERY UPSET. THEY RECEIVED A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE MAIL THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WAS FOR. ME, HEARTFELT LETTERS. -- IT WAS FROM ME, HEARTFELT LETTERS. THE BAD PART ABOUT IT THE DISHONESTY OF THE MEDIA IS THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME WILL BE INCLINED NOT TO DO IT ANYMORE. WHY SHOULD YOU RAISE $5.6 MILLION AND I THINK WE WILL GO OVER 6 MILLION PRETTY EASILY WILL BE SAID THAT WE STARTED THIS OUT AS A SMALL PROJECT. LESS THAN A MILLION DOLLARS. IT JUST KEPT MUSHROOMING AND BUILDING. BUT NOBODY TALKS ABOUT THAT. WE RAISED $5.6 MILLION WE HAD SO MANY HAPPY GROUPS AND HAPPY VETERANS AND I SEE THESE GUYS, THESE HILLARY CLINTON PEOPLE OUTSIDE. THEY DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT. THEY PROBABLY FIGURED BASED ON READING THE PRESS THAT DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T RAISE THIS KIND OF MONEY. BUT WE RAISED A LOT. I WILL BE RAISING MORE. AND I WILL BE SENDING IT TO OTHER PEOPLE AS WE GO ALONG. >>   IT IS A COMPLICATED PROCESS, YES. >>   NO, IT DOESN'T. THE GOVERNMENT APPROVES DIFFERENT GROUPS FOR A LOT OF REASONS. IT'S ALSO SPEAKING TO OTHER VETERANS. I DON'T WANT TO SEND A $250,000 CHECK TO A GROUP THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT. IT'S CALLED VETTING.  IT IS BOTHERSOME BECAUSE I LOVE THE VETERANS. I WORKED HARD FOR THEM. AS YOU CAN SEE, I'VE GIVEN A LOT OF MONEY AND RAISED A LOT OF MONEY FOR THEM. I THINK WHEN THE PRESS PORTRAYS IT DIFFERENTLY THE PRESS IS BEING VERY DISHONEST. I DON'T LIKE DISHONESTY. NOT YOU. GO AHEAD.  JEFF SESSIONS.  JEFF SESSIONS IS A FANTASTIC MAN. HE IS ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY RESPECTED PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. JEFF SESSIONS IS A PERSON THAT I BELIEVE TED CRUZ HAS THE MOST RESPECT FOR. I THINK TED CRUZ THOUGHT HE WOULD GET AN ENDORSEMENT FROM HIM. JEFF SESSIONS HAD NEVER ENDORSED A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BEFORE. AS MANY YEARS AS HE HAS BEEN IN THE SENATE. HE IS SOMEBODY THAT I WOULD CONSIDER. ABSOLUTELY. HE IS A FANTASTIC PERSON. YEAH, GO AHEAD.  IT IS A VERY TOUGH CALL. IT WAS AMAZING BECAUSE THERE WERE MOMENTS WHERE THE GORILLA WAS HOLDING THE CHILD AND IT WAS LIKE A MOTHER HOLDING A BABY. LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL AND CALM. AND THERE WERE MOMENTS WHERE IT LOOKED PRETTY DANGEROUS. I DON'T THINK THEY HAD A CHOICE. PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE. YOU HAVE A YOUNG CHILD IN DANGER. IT'S TOO BAD THERE WASN'T ANOTHER WAY. I THOUGHT IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL TO WATCH THAT POWERFUL, ALMOST 500 POUND GORILLA THE WAY HE HELPED WITH THAT LITTLE BOY. IT JUST TAKES ONE SECOND. IT JUST TAKES ONE LITTLE FLICK OF HIS FINGER AND I WILL TELL YOU THEY PROBABLY HAD NO CHOICE. >>  MR. TRUMP: GO AHEAD.   >>   I'M IN FAVOR OF FIXING THE V.A. HEALTH CARE. THAT IS ONE OF THE GREAT CATASTROPHES IN THIS COUNTRY. LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN PHOENIX IN DIFFERENT PLACES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WHERE THEY ARE CATCHING PEOPLE STEALING FROM IT. AND THEY DON'T EVEN FIRE THEM. PEOPLE ARE WAITING FIVE DAYS OR SIX DAYS ONLINE. THEY ARE DYING WHILE THEY WAIT ON LINE. I'M IN FAVOR OF IF THEY CAN'T GET TO A DOCTOR WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME THEY'RE GOING TO GO SEE A DOCTOR AND THE COUNTRY IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT. THEY CAN GO TO A PRIVATE DOCTOR OR A PUBLIC HOSPITAL BUT SOMEPLACE THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF THEM IMMEDIATELY. WE ARE LOSING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WAITING ON LINES FOR -- WAITING ON LINE. AND THEY VETERANS ADMINISTRATION IS RUN BY OBAMA JUST AS INCOMPETENTLY AS HE IS RUNNING OUR COUNTRY. LOOK AT THE TSA AT THE AIRPORTS. LOOK AT THAT. JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. THAT IS LIKE THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION. NOTHING IN OUR COUNTRY WORKS ANYMORE. IT IS A MESS. AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY I AM DOING SO WELL IN THE POLLS. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PRIVATIZATION. WHAT HAS TO BE IS WHEN SOMEBODY IS ONLINE AND THEY SAY THE SEVEN-DAY WADE THAT PERSON IS GOING TO WALK OVER ACROSS THE STREET TO A PRIVATE DOCTOR WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF HIM AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL PAY THE BILL. AND BY THE WAY, THAT WILL BE A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE. THAT'S GOING TO BE A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE THAN ONCE GOING ON NOW. THESE PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN HELL. HILLARY CLINTON SAID THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING JUST FINE. AT THE HEAD OF IT, MACDONALD, HE SAID WAITING IN LINE IS NOT BAD IT'S LIKE DISNEY WORLD. THESE ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE WE HAVE RUNNING THINGS. IT'S RIDICULOUS. THEY. >>  HALF OF THE AMERICANS SAY HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD STAY IN THE RACE EVEN IF SHE   YOU KNOW WHAT, DAVID , THAT IS THEIR CHOICE. YOU HAVE A PARTY CALLED THE DEMOCRATS THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. I THINK IT IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE HER BECAUSE IT IS RIGGED. A FEW PEOPLE WILL SAY I CAME UP WITH THE TERM RIGGED. I USED IT FOR MYSELF EXCEPT I WON BY SUCH BIG MARGINS. THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS RIGGED ON BOTH SIDES. SAME WITH THE REPUBLICANS, JUST NOT AS OBVIOUS. THE DEMOCRATS WITH THEIR SUPERDELEGATES IS RIDICULOUS. I THINK THAT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. IF YOU'RE ASKING ME WHO I WOULD PREFER TO RUN AGAINST. >>  DO YOU THINK SHE COMMITTED A FELONY?  I THINK WHAT SHE DID WAS VERY BAD. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE DONE A LOT LESS THAN HER AND THEIR LIVES WERE DESTROYED.  I THINK THAT'S FINE. GO AHEAD.  THE JUDGE HAS BEEN VERY UNFAIR, HE'S DONE A VERY BAD JOB. I WILL WIN THE TRUMP UNIVERSITY CASE. I AM ALREADY DOING IT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. I DON'T CARE. WHY ANTAGONIZE HIM? BECAUSE I DON'T CARE. I HAVE A JUDGE WHO IS VERY UNFAIR AND YOU WILL SEE IT IN COURT DOCUMENTS.  THE JUDGE IS VERY VERY UNFAIR. HE KNOWS IT'S UNFAIR. I WILL WIN THE TRUMP UNIVERSITY CASE. I COULD SETTLE THE CASE. I COULD'VE SETTLED IT. I CHOOSE NOT TO. WHEN I RAN THEY SAID WHY DIDN'T YOU SETTLE THE CASE? I DON'T WANT TO SETTLE THE CASE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? BECAUSE I AM A MAN OF PRINCIPLE. MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT TOOK THOSE COURSES HAVE LETTERS SAYING THEY FELT IT WAS GREAT. ESSENTIALLY. IT WAS GOOD. IT WAS GREAT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WHEN THEY ARE ON THE STAND AND YOU SAY HOW COME YOU SIGNED A LETTER SAYING THE TRUMP UNIVERSITY WAS SO GOOD. THE WOMAN THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL PLAINTIFF IN THE CASE, THEY WENT TO THE COURT AND THE JUDGE ALLOWED HER TO GET OUT OF THE CASE. THE CASE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DROPPED AT THAT POINT. THEY WANTED HER DISMISSED FROM THE CASE. YOU KNOW WHY? SHE WAS DEPOSED. SHE WAS SUCH A BAD WITNESS THAT WE WOULD WIN THE CASE EASILY. SHE IS ON TAPE SAYING UNBELIEVABLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT TRUMP UNIVERSITY. THEY DIDN'T WANT HER ANYMORE BECAUSE SHE IS A DISASTER FOR THEM. THEY WENT TO THE JUDGE AND THEY SAID YOUR HONOR WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HER NOT TO BE A PARTICIPANT IN THE CASE ANYMORE. HE SAID OH THAT'S OK. SHE'S THE START OF THE CASE. SHE HAS ALSO TO BEAUTIFUL STATEMENTS ABOUT IT AND SHE IS ON TAPE SAYING HOW GREAT TRUMP UNIVERSITY IS. THEY DON'T WANT HER. I WOULDN'T WANT HER EITHER. I COULD SETTLE THAT CASE ANY TIME. I CAN SELL THAT CASE. I DON'T WANT TO. YEAH, GO AHEAD.  >>  WHY ARE YOU SUPPORTING NOW?  BECAUSE WE ARE DOWN THE LINE. YOU CAN'T WIN AS AN INDEPENDENT. FOR THE MOST PART, YOU CANNOT GET IN TEXAS AND VARIOUS OTHER STATES. SO TEXAS IS OUT. YOU CAN EVEN GET ON THE BALLOT ON PLACES. YOU WILL NOT HAVE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. THERE COULD BE AS MANY AS FOUR OR FIVE. THAT'S OVER. BILL KRISTOL IS THE ONE. HE'S THE LAST ONE. DON'T FORGET. HE SAID TRUMP WOULD NEVER RUN. HE'S NOT A SMART PERSON. HE SAID DONALD TRUMP WILL NEVER RUN. REMEMBER? DO YOU REMEMBER? I ACTUALLY BLAME YOU. WHY DO YOU PUT THIS GUY ON TELEVISION? I SEE HIM ON THE DIFFERENT SHOWS. HE HAS NO CREDIBILITY. HE SAID I WON'T RUN. HE SAID IF I RUN I WILL NOT DO WELL. AND IF I RUN, THIS AND THAT. HE LOOKS LIKE SUCH A FOOL. HE'S PRACTICALLY CRYING BECAUSE HE CAN'T JUSTIFY IT. NOW HE COMES OUT WITH A TWEET OVER THE WEEKEND OVER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S GOING TO PUT SOME OF YOU. DESPERATE SOMEBODY UP. EVEN I THOUGHT IT. I THOUGHT THEY WOULD FIND SOME INDY. NOW HE COMES OUT WITH SOMETHING SAYING HE WAS A WAS KIDDING. THESE PEOPLE ARE LOSERS. HE'S TRYING TO MAKE YOU, DRIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT NUTS. IF THEY DO AN INDY, WHICH I ASSUME IS DECENT, ALTHOUGH HE COULDN'T BE SOMEBODY DECENT BECAUSE IT WOULD LOOK LIKE FOOLS. WHAT YOU DO IS, IF THEY DO RUN AN INDEPENDENT WHEN YOU HAVE IS YOU LOSE THE ELECTION FOR THE REPUBLICANS AND THEREFORE YOU LOSE THE SUPREME COURT. YOU HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE PUT ON THE SUPREME COURT THAT THIS COUNTRY WILL NEVER EVER RECOVER. IT WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. >>   NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT. I SAID BILL KRISTOL IS A LOSER. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY, CARL. HE HAS CALLED EVERY SINGLE ONE WRONG. HE SAYS I'M GOING TO LOSE THIS DAY, I WIN IN A LANDSLIDE. I DIDN'T SAY EVERYBODY. MANY GOOD BUT I DIDN'T SAY EVERYBODY. BILL KRISTOL IS A LOSER. HIS MAGAZINE IS FAILING AS YOU KNOW. I DON'T THINK IT EVEN SURVIVES. IT'S GETTING SOME FREE PUBLICITY. BUT BILL KRISTOL I'VE BEEN , WATCHING THIS FOR TWO YEARS. TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO RUN. WE GO TO NEW HAMPSHIRE. OH, HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN ENHANCER. I WON NEW HAMPSHIRE IND A LANDSLIDE. I WIN IN A LANDSLIDE. DO YOU THINK MAYBE HE DOESN'T LIKE ME? ONE OR TWO MORE QUESTIONS. YEAH, GO AHEAD.  >>  STOP BEATING UP ON REPUBLICANS. HE GOES ON TO SAY -- 30% OF THE VOTE.   THAT'S WRONG. I DIDN'T GET 30% OF THE VOTE. MY LAST ONE WAS 78%. I DIDN'T GET 30%.  HERE'S THE WAY I LOOK AT IT. WHEN I HAVE SOMETHING WAS NOT MY SIDE -- BY THE WAY, I HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF APPLAUSE FROM THE PRESS. IN TERMS OF THE ACHIEVEMENT BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS REALLY WELL UNIFIED. PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULD'VE NEVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE ARE NOW SAYING I SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP. REMEMBER THAT. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT TOO MUCH. HOW FAST THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S HEALING. IT IS A HEALING PROCESS. THAT WAS A ROUGH CAMPAIGN. I DON'T KNOW FRED MALEK. I CAN SAY THIS. THE REAL STORY IS HOW FAST WE ARE GETTING TOGETHER. IF I HAVE A REPUBLICAN WHO IS NOT ON MY SIDE, WHY SHOULD I BE NICE TO THAT PERSON? I'M NOT GOING TO GO AFTER THEM LIKE I WOULD HILLARY OR CRAZY BERNIE. I HAVE NO OBLIGATION. WHY SHOULD I BE NICE TO THAT PERSON? POLITICALLY I MAY BE RIGHT I MAY BE WRONG. BUT THAT'S WHO I AM. I'M A VERY HONEST PERSON. IF SOMEBODY'S GOING TO SAY SOMETHING NEGATIVE ABOUT ME IF THEY HAVE TO BE REPUBLICAN I MAY CHOOSE TO HAVE THEM BACK. -- IF THEY HAPPEN TO BE REPUBLICAN, I MAY CHOOSE TO HIT TO THEM BACK. NOT ALWAYS. I MAY CHOOSE TO HIT THEM BACK.  I'M NOT A FAN OF MITT ROMNEY. MITT ROMNEY LOST AN ELECTION THAT HE SHOULD HAVE WON. IF YOU READ THE FRONT PAGE OF THE WALL STREET JOURNAL HE LOOKS LIKE A FOOL. I AM NOT A FAN OF MITT ROMNEY. JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND. I RAISED A LOT OF MONEY FOR MITT ROMNEY. I MADE ROBOCALLS FOR HIM. I MADE SPEECHES FOR HIM. HE LET US DOWN. IF YOU READ THE FRONT PAGE OF THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THIS WEEKEND. MITT ROMNEY LOOKS LIKE A FOOL. WHY WOULD I SAY SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT MITT ROMNEY?  SHE WAS NOT NICE AND I WAS FINE, JUST A LITTLE BIT OF THE JAB. BUT SHE WASN'T NICE. AND YOU THINK I'M GOING TO CHANGE? I'M NOT CHANGING. INCLUDING WITH HER. ONE MORE.  BOB DOLE IS A FAN OF MINE. BOB DOLE ENDORSED ME. DON'T TELL ME ABOUT BOB DOLE. >>  MR. TRUMP GARY JOHNSON GOT 1% OF : THE VOTE LAST TIME. I WATCHED THAT WHOLE SITUATION AND IT WAS DISGRACEFUL. I THINK HE IS A FRINGE CANDIDATE. YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. I LOOK AT HIM AND I WATCH HIS MOTIONS AND I WATCH WHAT HE SAYS. I THINK HE IS A FRINGE CANDIDATE. AND YOUR SECOND, YOU KNOW, WELD, WHEN YOU DO A LITTLE RESEARCH ON HIM YOU WILL FIND HE WILL NOT BE A FACTOR. >>  I THINK YOU SET A NEW BAR TODAY   NOT ALL OF YOU JUST MANY OF YOU. NOT YOU DAVID.  YES, IT IS. YES, IT IS GOING TO BE LIKE THIS, DAVID. LET ME SAY SOMETHING. I'M A PERSON, YES IT IS GOING TO BE LIKE THIS, DAVID. HALF OF YOU ARE AMAZED THAT I RAISED ALL THIS MONEY. WHEN THE PRESS WRITES FALSE STORIES LIKE THEY DID WITH THE VETERANS BECAUSE ABOUT HALF OF YOU ARE AMAZED THAT I RAISED ALL THIS MONEY. IF THE PRESS WRITES FALSE STORIES LIKE THEY DID WHERE I WANTED TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE. I DIDN'T WANT THE CREDIT FOR RAISING ALL THIS MONEY FOR THE VETERANS. MORE MONEY IS COMING IN. I WASN'T LOOKING FOR THE CREDIT. BUT I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO DO THIS BECAUSE THE PRESS WAS SAYING I DIDN'T RAISE ANY MONEY. THERE IS A VETTING PROCESS THAT WE HAD TO GO THROUGH. PROBABLY MORE THAN $6 MILLION WILL COME IN. WHEN I RAISE $5.6 BILLION AND MORE IS COMING IN THIS IS GOING -- $5.6 MILLION AS OF TODAY AND MORE IS COMING IN THIS IS GOING TO PHENOMENAL GROUPS. I HAVE MANY PEOPLE VETTING THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING THE MONEY. WORKING HARD. AND WE HAVE TO READ STORIES PROBABLY LIBELOUS STORIES CERTAINLY CLOSE IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND PEOPLE KNOW THE STORIES ARE FALSE. I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO ATTACK THE PRESS. LOOK I FIND THE PRESS TO BE , EXTREMELY DISHONEST. THE POLITICAL PRESS IS UNBELIEVABLY DISHONEST. I WILL SAY THAT. OK THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. ,THANK YOU.

I SAID MAYBE WE CAN RAISE THE  MONEY FOR THE VETS, RIHTGHT?  I SAID WE WOULD RAISE HALF $1  MILLION.  I SAID MAYBE WE COULD DO MORE. I SAID MAYBE WE CAN DO $1  MILLION. AND A COUPLE OF MY FRIENDS FROM LAS VEGAS, CARL ICAHN, WE HAVE  SO MANY DIFFERENT -- MIKE  PERLMUTTER. THESE GUYS GAY BETWEEN HALF A MILLION AND $1 MILLION. I SAID $3 MILLION.  MAYBE WE'LL GET IT UP TO $5  BILLION.  MAYBE WE WILL GET UP TO $6  MILLION.  AND WE RAISED MORE THAN FIVE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE VETS.  AND I NEVER GOT SUCH BATTLE WAS THE THEM I LIKE. IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. WE GIVE TO MANY GROUPS. MANY GROUPS. IT IS PRETTY CLOSE TO $6 MILLION  WE RAISE. IT IS FOR OUR VETERANS. WE LOVE THEM. THERE IS NOBODY LIKE THEM. IT WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD OUR  MILITARY.  BY THE WAY, BIGGER, BETTER, STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE.  BUT A BIG PART OF THAT IS THAT  WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN  A LONG TIME.  WE LOVE OUR VETS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, FELLAS. WE APPRECIATE IT.  AND HE IS NOT A VET. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. PHIL, DON.   WE HAVE A GREAT VET,  WORLD WAR II. HE LOOKS LIKE A YOUNG GUY. POINT THEM OUT. HE IS IN THE FRONT ROW. BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FANTASTIC.

BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TIRED. PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF THE HILLARY CLINTONS OF THE WORLDS.  IT IS ALL TALK, NO ACTION. IT IS CROOKED HILLARY. SAME STUFF. OUR COUNTRY CANNOT TAKE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF OBAMA. THAT IS WHAT YOU WILL BE  GETTING.  I TELL YOU. I MEAN, JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE TSA, YOUR AIRPORTS, TAKE A LOOK  AT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH OUR  MILITARY, THAT WE LOVE.  WE CANNOT BE ISIS. WE ARE GOING TO BE THEM QUICKLY.  WE'RE GOING TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF THEM. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THERE IN  THE FIRST PLACE.  BUT WE WILL BE GOING, AND WE WILL HAVE TO REBUILD OUR  COUNTRY. WE SPENT $5 TRILLION IN THE MIDDLE EAST. AND RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR IT.  IF WE WOULD NOT HAVE SPENT $.10, WE WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER OFF.  BELIEVE ME, WE WILL REBUILD OUR  COUNTRY, OUR MILITARY. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR NEEDS, INCLUDING OUR VETS. AND WE ARE GOING TO BRING IT  BACK, PHONE. IT IS WHAT HAPPENED QUICKLY. AND WE'RE GOING TO BUILD THE  WALL. THE WALL, WE'RE GOING TO BUILD THE WALL. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD THE WALL. LATINOS FOR TRUMP!  I LOVE YOU. YOU KNOW, BUILD THE WALL.  THANK YOU. OH, WE ARE GOING TO BUILD IT. AND IF WE DO NOT, WE WILL GET PAPA TO DO IT. HE IS THE BIG GUY IN TOWN. HE EMPLOYS A LOT OF PEOPLE, LOTS OF JOBS, LOTS OF EDUCATION,  HEALTH CARE. WE LOVE THEM. THANK YOU. SO, WE HAVE HAD AN EXCITING TIME. WHEN STARTED THIS JOURNEY ON JUNE 16, NOT SO LONG AGO, ALMOST A YEAR, HARD TO BELIEVE, I HAVE  TO SAY WE HAVE BEEN ON THE COVER OF ""TIME"" MAGAZINE. IT IS REALLY ABOUT THE MOVEMENT.  WE HAVE CREATED A MOVEMENT. IT IS A MOVEMENT OF COMMON SENSE, SMART, NOT GOING TO BE  RIPPED OFF ANYMORE. GET HIM OUT OF HERE. GET THEM OUT.  AND SOMEBODY SAID, BY THE WAY,  WHY ARE YOU GOING TO SAN DIEGO? WHY ARE YOU GOING TO CALIFORNIA? YOU ALREADY WON THE PRIMARY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO. I SAID, VERY SIMPLY, BECAUSE I SAID I WOULD GO. I HAVE TO BE HERE, RIGHT?  I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU. AND I LOVE SAN DIEGO. I HAVE SOME NEW FRIENDS IN SAN  DIEGO. I LOVE SAN DIEGO. AND I REALLY LIKE WHEN THEY PUT UP LATINOS FOR TRUMP. WE ARE GOING TO DO GREAT WITH THE LATINOS. BECAUSE I AM BRINGING BACK JOBS THE LATINOS, AFRICAN-AMERICANS -- WE ARE DOING GREAT WITH  AFRICAN-AMERICANS.  THEY WANT JOBS. WE ARE LOSING OUR JOBS TO  EVERYBODY. WE ARE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE WORLD. WE ARE LOSING OUR JOBS TO  EVERYBODY. WE ARE GOING TO BRING BACK JOBS LIKE WE HAVE NOT SEEN IN THIS COUNTRY FOR MANY, MANY DECADES.  AND PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT DOING WELL, THEY ARE GOING TO START  DOING VERY, VERY WELL.  BELIEVE ME. OK. SO, ON JUNE 16, I CAME DOWN THE  ESCALATOR WITH MY WIFE, MALANIA.  I SAID, WOW, I HAVE NEVER SEEN,  OUTSIDE OF THE ACADEMY AWARDS,  THIS KIND OF PRESS. BUT LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVE TODAY. MOSTLY LIVE CAMERAS. SOME OF THE MOST DISHONEST  PEOPLE IN THE UNIVERSE.  WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THOSE CAMERAS  AND SPIN THEM AROUND A BIT. SHOW THEM. TAKE THEM. SPIN THEM AROUND. THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. THAT IS WHY I LOVE MY PROTESTERS.  BECAUSE THE ONLY TIME THEY SHOW  HOW BIG OUR CROWDS ARE, THE ONLY TIME, IS WHEN THERE IS A  PROTESTER. THAT IS SOMETHING THEY THINK. BUT I LOVE OUR PROTESTERS,  RIGHT?  SO, I CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR. AND I MADE A SPEECH. AND IF YOU NOTICED, THAT IS MY NOTES FOR THE SPEECH. WE GO FREE FROM. WE DON'T WANT TO PROMPT HER'S,ERS, RIGHT? WE OUGHT TO HAVE A LAW. IF YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, YOU SHOULD NOT USE  TELEPROMPTERS. WE HAVE A TELEPROMPTER GUY, WE  DON'T NEED THAT.  WE DON'T NEED THAT. SO, I STARTED TALKING ABOUT  ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. TREMENDOUS PROBLEM. I DON'T THINK IT'S A BE A PROBLEM THAT WOULD EVEN BE DISCUSSED, FRANKLY, IF WE DID  NOT DO IT AND PUT IT AS PART OF  OUR CAMPAIGN. AND WE TALKED ABOUT BAD TRADES,  REALLY BAD TRADES.  WE ARE LOSING $500 BILLION A  YEAR WITH CHINA. WE ARE LOSING $58 BILLION A YEAR WITH MEXICO.  WE ARE LOSING OVER $100 BILLION  A YEAR WITH JAPAN. AND EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY, NO  MATTER WHAT -- NAME A COUNTRY -- WE LOSE.  WE DO NOT WIN ANYMORE. WE'RE GOING TO START WINNING. WITH TRADE, MILITARY.  WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING  AGAIN.  NOW, OUR PRESIDENT IS RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE RIGHT. PATHETIC.  HONESTLY, FOLKS, WE HAVE LEADERSHIP RIGHT NOW IN THIS COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY AT THE TOP,  THAT IS GROSSLY INCOMPETENT.  THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY ARE DOING. THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE  DOING.  SO I THOUGHT, THIS IS JAPAN, IN HIROSHIMA, AND THAT IS FINE. THIS IS LONG AS HE DOES NOT APOLOGIZE, ABSOLUTELY FINE. WHO CARES? BUT HE SAID TODAY THAT OUR TRADING PARTNERS, AND COUNTRIES  THAT WE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH, THEY'RE RATTLED. AND I SAID, SO GOOD. AND A VERY, VERY POWERFUL GUY, A  VERY GREAT GUY, I WILL NOT USE  HIS NAME BUT MOST OF YOU KNOW, I  SAW HIM LAST WEEK. KNOWS EVERYBODY. HIGHLY RESPECTED. HE SAID DONALD, I HAVE NO IDEA  THIS WOULD HAPPEN.  BUT I'M BEING CALLED BY ALL OF  THESE COUNTRIES, GERMANY, JAPAN,  SAUDI ARABIA, THINK OF IT. WE DEFEND THESE COUNTRIES. AND THEY DO NOT PAY US WHAT THEY  ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. GERMANY, SAUDI ARABIA, JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, MANY OTHERS. THEN YOU LOOK AT THE NATO COUNTRIES -- 28 TOTAL. MANY OF THEM ARE NOT LIVING UP TO OBLIGATIONS. SO, WE HAVE COMMON SENSE. WE HAVE VISIBILITY. WHAT HAPPENS IS THIS. HE SAID, I CANNOT BELIEVE IT. I DID NOT LIKE YOUR RHETORIC. AND I HAPPEN TO BE A NICE PERSON, FOLKS. I WOULD GET ALONG SO GREAT WITH  THESE COUNTRIES.  I WOULD GET ALONG SO GREAT.  BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY ARE OUR FRIENDS, ALLIES.  BUT THEY HAVE BEEN ABUSING US. THEY HAVE BEEN ABUSING US.  40 YEARS AGO, WHEN THEY COULD'VE DONE WHATEVER WE WANTED, WE OWN $19 TRILLION. IT IS GOING UP TO $21 TRILLION  BECAUSE OF THE OMNIBUS BUDGET,  WHICH WAS NOT SO GOOD. THAT IS THE BUDGET THAT ALLOWS  PEOPLE TO COME IN FROM SYRIA,  PEOPLE ACROSS THE BORDER, FUND OBAMACARE, WHICH WE SHOULD NOT  HAVE DONE.  BECAUSE WE WILL TERMINATE OBAMACARE AND REPLACE IT, BELIEVE ME, WITH SOMETHING GOOD.  BELIEVE ME. REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE. SO, THIS MAN SAID, DONNELL, I  CANNOT BELIEVE IT.  AND HE IS LIKE THE BIGGEST OF THE BIG. HE SAID I DISAGREED WITH YOUR  STYLE.  I REALLY DID. I DISAGREED. AND YET, NOW ALL THE COUNTRIES  ARE CALLING. HOW DO WE GET ALONG WITH TRUMP? WE THINK HE IS GOING TO WIN. HOW DO WE DO IT? THEY ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT  VANTAGE. NO MORE, FOLKS.  WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH.  NO MORE. SO, THE PRESS IS DISHONEST.  AND WHAT THEY SAY, AND WHAT I SAY, IS VERY DIFFERENT.  I WATCHED HILLARY CLINTON LAST NIGHT, WHICH IS HARD TO DO  BECAUSE YOU THE VERY BORING  SPEAKER. AND I WILL NOT SAY, I WILL NOT SAY BECAUSE IT IS NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT.  IT IS NOT A NICE THING TO SAY. BUT I WILL NOT SAY IT. THAT SHE SHOUTS INTO THE MICROPHONE, AND IT DRIVES  EVERYBODY CRAZY. SO, I WILL NOT SAY THAT. BUT I FOUND IT VERY HARD TO WATCH. AND THEN SHE LIVES. ES. NOW, I CALLED SOMEONE A LIAR. I DON'T SAY THAT ANYMORE. THAT PERSON IS NOW IN THE PAST. WITH HILLARY, WE SAY CRICKET HILLARY. BUT I HAVE TO ADD ANOTHER WORD,  BECAUSE I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS  FOR LAST NIGHT, SHE WAS SAYING THAT I WANT JAPAN ARMED WITH  NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  I NEVER SAID. SHE SAID I LOVE THE DICTATOR IN  NORTH KOREA.  I DON'T LOVE THEM. BAD GUY, OK? BAD GUY. SHE WAS SAYING ALL SORTS OF THINGS, SO BAD AND SO FALSE,  TOTAL LIES. WE ARE NOT WANT TO LET HER GET  AWAY WITH IT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET HER GET  AWAY.  WATCH WHAT I DO SAY. WE DO HAVE TREMENDOUS DEFICITS. WE ARE LOSING A FORTUNE. OUR JOBS PICTURE IS TERRIBLE. DO NOT BELIEVE THE 5%. THE REAL NUMBER IS AT LEAST 20%.  WHEN YOU LOOK FOR A JOB, AND I CAN TELL PEOPLE -- RAISE YOUR  HANDS. LOOK AT THE SIZE OF HIS ROOM. PACKED TO EVERY CORNER.  YOU KNOW WHAT?  PEOPLE IN THE POLLS LOVE ME ON  SECURITY. AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE  IMPORTANT THAN NATIONAL  SECURITY.  THEY LOVE ME. HONESTLY, WE WOULD NOT HAVE  KRAUS LIKE THIS -- IT IS  EVERYWHERE WE GO. THEY'RE AS BIG AS THE ROOM. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE  OUTSIDE THE CANNOT GET IN.  OK?  AND IT IS NOT LIKE, YOU KNOW, FRIDAY AFTERNOON.  YOU COULD BE DOING SOMETHING  ELSE, I GUESS? RIGHT? ARE THESE THE GREATEST PLACES --THE TRUCK RALLIE THE TRUMP RALLIES?  AND BY THE WAY, THE SAFEST PLACE  TO BE IN THIS COUNTRY IS IN A  DONALD TRUMP RALLY. THAT, I CAN TELL YOU.  AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY.  NOT JUST THE PEOPLE IN THIS  ROOM. NOT JUST WHAT THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM REPRESENT, WHICH IS LARGELY LOVE. BECAUSE IT IS LOVE. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY. INCLUDING PEOPLE THAT DO NOT  KNOW IF THEY LIKE THE PEOPLE IN  THIS ROOM. BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO UNIFY  OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE WHEN YOU TAKE CARE OF  HISPANICS, GET JOBS, TAKE CARE  OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO ARE REALLY SUFFERING IN THIS  COUNTRY. AND HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT DO A DAMN THING FOR THEM. AND SHE NEVER WILL. AND GUESS WHAT? SHE DOES NOT WANT TO. OK? SHE COULD NOT CARE LESS. SO, IT HAS WORKED OUT BEYOND  WHAT WE THOUGHT.  WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE, IN JULY, IN CLEVELAND FIGHTING FOR OUR  LIVES. AND I SAY, WHAT YOU TALKING  ABOUT?  WE'RE GOING TO WIN ON THE FIRST BALLOT, RIGHT?  NOW, I DID NOT KNOW IT WAS WHEN  TO GO THIS QUICKLY. LOOK AT THE CAMERAS, THEY TURNED  BECAUSE THEY FOUND A PROTESTER. LOOK AT THOSE CAMERAS, THOSE  BLOODSUCKERS. THEY FOUND A PROTESTER. THANK YOU, PROTESTER. THANK YOU, PROTESTER. THANK YOU. GET HIM OUT. GET THEM OUT. GET THEM THE HELL OUT OF HERE.  IT IS ALWAYS FUNNY. USUALLY, THEY ARE JUST SINGLES. YOU KNOW, MOM KICKED THEM OUT OF  THE HOUSE FOR A WEEK.  THEY ARE USUALLY SINGLE. YOU CAN NEVER HEAR THEM.  BUT WHAT YOU YEAR ARE PEOPLE  SAYING GET THEM OUT. MY PEOPLE MAKE SO MUCH NOISE.  IT IS TRUE. SO, LET ME JUST TELL YOU, BERNIE SANDERS HAS BEEN GREAT. WE LIKE BERNIE.  I LIKE BERNIE.  YOU KNOW WHY? HE DOES NOT HAVE A CHANCE.  AND WHAT HE IS DOING TO HER IS  INCREDIBLE. BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS RATE  AGAINST BERNIE. IF YOU EVER NOTICE, HE WINS,  WINS. YOU WATCH THE PUNDITS, THESE  GUYS, THE DISHONEST ONES.  THEY SAY HE CANNOT   I HAVE TO SAY OUR SYSTEM WAS  RIGGED, TOO, EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.  IF YOU WIN BY MASSIVE LANDSLIDES  EVERY WEEK, IT IS NO LONGER RIGGED.  IT IS LIKE THE BOXERS.  THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED.  THE SYSTEM WAS NOT MEANT FOR ME  TO COME IN AS AN OUTSIDER THAT  BUILT A GREAT COMPANY.  I BUILT A GREAT, GREAT COMPANY.  WHEN I FILED -- IN FACT, PAPA  DOUG KNOWS WHEN I FILED MY  PAPERS, OVER 100 PAGES IN  FEDERAL ELECTIONS, AND I FILED.  TREMENDOUS COMPANY, TREMENDOUS  ICONIC ASSETS.  UNBELIEVABLE CASH FLOW.  VERY LITTLE DEBT.  MAKES A LOT OF MONEY.  AND THEY WERE SO UNHAPPY TO SEE IT.  BUT I SAY IT FOR A DIFFERENT REASON.  I STARTED OFF, BY THE WAY, WITH  A $1 MILLION LOAN AND HAVE A NET  WORTH OF MUCH MORE THAN $10  BILLION.  I DON'T EVEN WANT IT.  ALL I WANT TO SAY IS THIS IS  THE KIND OF THINKING WE NEED TO  STRAIGHTEN OUT THIS MESS THEY  HAVE GIVEN US IN OUR GREAT COUNTRY.  THIS IS THE THINKING WE NEED.  THIS IS WHAT WE NEED. SO LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT  ABOUT SAN DIEGO, BECAUSE WE ARE  TALKING ABOUT A RIGGED SYSTEM,  RIGHT? I HAVE TO SAY THIS.  I WAS TOLD, LAURA SAID DON'T DO  THAT. WE ARE GOING TO WIN.  BUT SAN DIEGO IS SPECIAL FOR A  LOT OF REASONS.  SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS LIVE  HERE. YOU MAY HAVE THE BEST WEATHER ON  EARTH.  I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD IT.  I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD IT.  WE HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTES.  DOES EVERYBODY HAVE A LITTLE TIME?  SO I END UP WITH A LAWSUIT, AND  IT ENDS UP IN SAN DIEGO IN FEDERAL COURT. IT IS A DISGRACE THE WAY THE FEDERAL COURT IS ACTING, BECAUSE IT IS A SIMPLE LAWSUIT. EVERYBODY THAT TOOK THE SO-CALLED COURSE. TRUMP UNIVERSITY IS IN SAN DIEGO. THE TRIAL, THEY WANTED IT TO START WHILE I AM RUNNING FOR  PRESIDENT. THE TRIAL IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE  SOMETIME IN NOVEMBER. THERE SHOULD BE NO TRIAL. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISMISSED ON SUMMARY JUDGMENT EASILY. EVERYBODY SAYS IT, BUT I HAVE A JUDGE WHO IS A HATER OF DONALD TRUMP. A HATER. HE'S A HATER. HIS NAME IS GONZALO CUIIAL.  AND HE IS NOT DOING THE RIGHT THING. AND I FIGURE WHAT THE HELL? WHY NOT TALK ABOUT IT FOR TWO MINUTES.  SHOULD I TALK ABOUT IT? YES?  SO WE SHOULD HAVE WON.  I AM BEING RAILROADED.  HERE IS THE STORY.  VERY SIMPLE STORY.  A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO, A LONG  TIME AGO NOW, I OPEN UP A LITTLE SCHOOL.  WE CALLED IT TRUMP UNIVERSITY,  CHANGED THE NAME.  WE HAD PROBABLY -- A LOT OF  PEOPLE, LIKE 10,000 PEOPLE.  HUGH, DID YOU LIKE IT?  SHE SAID SHE WAS THERE, AND SHE  LIKED IT.  HERE IS THE STORY.  SO WE OPEN UP, AND IT REALLY WAS  SUCCESSFUL FROM THE BEGINNING.  THEN WE GET THESE CLASS ACTION  LAWYERS.  THEY IMMEDIATELY SUE.  MY PEOPLE DID A GOOD JOB FOR A  COUPLE OF REASONS.  ONE OF THE REASONS WAS THEY HAD  EVERYBODY THAT TOOK THE COURSE  SIGN LIKE A REPORT CARD.  WE HAD 10 PEOPLE. -- 10,000 PEOPLE. ALMOST THAT MANY SIGNED A REPORT  CARD.  AND THE REPORT CARDS ARE UNBELIEVABLE.  WITHOUT THAT, IT IS THEIR WORD  VERSUS THESE PEOPLE OR ME.  BUT I AM GETTING RAILROADED BY A  LEGAL SYSTEM, AND FRANKLY THEY  SHOULD BE ASHAMED.  I WILL BE HERE IN NOVEMBER.  HEY, IF I WIN AS PRESIDENT, IT  IS A CIVIL CASE.  I COULD HAVE SETTLED THIS CASE  NUMEROUS TIMES.  BUT I DON'T WANT TO SETTLE CASES  WHEN WE ARE RIGHT.  I DON'T BELIEVE IN IT.  WHEN YOU START SETTLING CASES,  DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS?  EVERYBODY SUES YOU BECAUSE YOU  GET KNOWN AS A SETTLER.  ONE THING ABOUT ME, I AM NOT  KNOWN AS THE SETTLER.  AND PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WITH THIS  WHOLE THING, WITH THIS WHOLE  DEAL WITH THE LAWYERS, CLASS  ACTION LAWYERS ARE THE WORST.  IT IS A SCAM.  HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS.  WE ARE IN FRONT OF A VERY  HOSTILE JUDGE.  THE JUDGE WAS APPOINTED BY BARAK OBAMA.  HE SHOULD RECUSE HIMSELF. HE HAS GIVEN US RULING AFTER  RULING, NEGATIVE. I HAVE A TOP LAURA WHO SAID HE  HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE  THIS BEFORE.  SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WE GET SUED. WE HAVE A MAGISTRATE NAMED WILLIAM GALLO WHO TRULY HATES US. THE GOOD NEWS IS IT IS A JAIR TRIAL. -- JURY TRIAL BUT WE CAN EVEN  GET A FULL JURY. WE ARE ENTITLED TO A JURY, AND WE WANT A JURY OF 12 PEER. FIRST OF ALL, IT SHOULD BE DISMISSED. WATCH HOW WE WHEN IT BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN TREATED UNFAIRLY. VERY MUCH LIKE WITH THE  VETERANS, WHERE I RAISED ALL  THAT MONEY, BUT ON TUESDAY I AM  ANNOUNCING ALL OF THE GROUPS WE HAVE GIVEN ALMOST $6 MILLION TO.  YOU TURN THINGS AROUND.  HERE IS THE STORY.  WE HAVE A LAW FIRM NAMED ROBIN SKELLER.  IT IS THE SPIN-OFF OF TWO LAW FIRMS.  TWO OF THOSE PARTNERS WENT TO  JAIL FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF  TIME FOR DOING VERY BAD THINGS LEGALLY.  THIS SAME GROUP IS THE LAWYERS AGAINST.  WHAT HAPPENS IS THE JUDGE, WHO  HAPPENS TO BE MEXICAN, WHICH IS GREAT.  I THINK THAT IS FINE.  I THINK THE MEXICANS ARE GOING  TO END UP LOVING DONALD TRUMP  WHEN I GIVE ALL THESE JOBS.  I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE . I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE ME.  HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS.  WE GET SUED BY A WOMAN, AND SHE  TURNS OUT TO BE A DISASTER FOR THEM.  HER NAME IS TARLA MARKOV.  SHE RATED ON THE REPORT CARD, IT  IS 1-5.  FIVE BEING EXCELLENT, THE  HIGHEST MARK.  SHE GAVE ME A FIVE ACROSS THE  BOARD, ALL FIVES.  SHE THEN DID A VIDEO SAYING IT  WAS FANTASTIC, THE MOST GLOWING  VIDEO YOU HAVE EVER SEEN.  SHE THEN SUED ME BECAUSE THEY SHE WANTED HER MONEY BACK.  SHE WAS SUCH A DISASTER THAT  THIS JUDGE -- IT WAS HER AGAINST US.  SHE WAS SUCH A DISASTER THAT  THIS JUDGE ALLOWED HER TO GET  OUT OF THE CASE.  BUT WE WANT HER TO BE IN THE CASE.  THE LAWYER SAID YOUR HONOR, WE  WANT HER TO BE IN THE CASE.  HE SAID SHE IS OUT OF THE CASE.  SO NOW WE HAVE OTHERS.  WE SAY DISMISS THE CASE.  SHE IS OUT OF THE CASE.  NO, WE WON'T DISMISS IT.  SO WE HAVE 10,000 SERVERS FROM  FORMER STUDENTS GIVEN TRUMP  UNIVERSITY RAVE REVIEWS.  IT IS CALLED, WWW.98PERCENTAPPROVAL.COM. SO WE HAVE MAKOV GIVING US THESE  GREAT NUMBERS.  THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE. BOB.  THEY USED HIM.  JEB BUSH, LOW ENERGY.  WE HAVE THESE GUYS MAKING COMMERCIALS. IN ALL FAIRNESS, IT HASN'T HURT  ME MUCH.  EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, YOU HAVE ONE.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN.  BUT IF I DON'T WIN, AND EVEN IF  I DO WIN, WE WANT TO -- MY KIDS WILL OPEN IT UP AGAIN, BECAUSE IT WAS A TERRIFIC SCHOOL. IT WAS GOOD. SO WE HAVE A GUY NAMED BOB. HE APPEARED IN A TV ATTACK ADAM. THEY USED HIM ON ADS AGAINST ME? I HAD 66,000 NEGATIVE ADS, OVER $100 MILLION IN FLORIDA ALONE DURING THE BIG PRIMARY, WHICH I WON IN A LANDSLIDE. WE HAD 15,000 NEGATIVE ADS, AND  I WON.  I ALMOST WONDER WHAT DO ADS MEAN?  BOB APPEARED IN TV ATTACK ADS  EVEN THOUGH HE RATED THE  PROGRAMS A FIVE, MEANING  EXCELLENT, THE TOP MARK ACROSS  THE BOARD.  HIS PRIMARY COMPLAINT WAS HE  WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE MORE  COMFORTABLE CHAIRS. UNBELIEVABLE.  THEN WE HAVE A GUY NAMED ART.  AND HE WAS LATE TO FILE.  SO HE SIGNED A SURVEY IN WHICH  HE RATED THE PROGRAM EITHER A  FOUR OR A FIVE.  I WILL TELL YOU THIS.  HOW SMART WAS IT TO ASK  EVERYBODY THAT TOOK THE COURSE  TO SIGN A REPORT CARD?  NOW YOU KNOW WHAT THE LAWYERS  ARE SAYING?  THE LAWYERS ARE SAYING BUT THEY  WERE FORCED.  10,000 PEOPLE WERE FORCED.  WE ACTUALLY HAVE VIDEOTAPES OF  PEOPLE.  THEY WEREN'T FORCED.  A PROFESSOR SAID WOULD YOU SIGN?  HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?  THAT IS IT.  SO HE SIGNED ALL FIVES AND FOURS  OUT OF A POSSIBLE FIVE.  AND HE INDICATED HIS ONLY  COMPLAINT WAS A LACK OF NICE  LUNCH SANDWICHES.  THINK OF IT.  SO HE WAS LATE.  SO THEY WENT TO THE JUDGE, AND  THE JUDGE SAID HE IS LATE.  WHY DIDN'T YOU FILE UNDER RICO?  ORGANIZED CRIME?  WE HAVE ALL BEEN SUED IN  BUSINESS FOR RICO. EVEN PAPA JOHN PROBABLY.  BUT THEY ENDED IT PRETTY MUCH.  I GET SUED.  HERE IS A GUY THAT GIVES ME ALL  GOOD MARKS.  HE IS LATE.  SO THEY ARE STARTING A NEW LAWSUIT. THIS LAW FIRM GAVE A LOT OF  MONEY TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF  NEW YORK, WHO IS A TOTAL LIGHTWEIGHT. HIS NAME IS ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC SNYDERMAN. HE ACCEPTS THEIR MONEY, GOES TO  MEET WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN IN SYRACUSE AND IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO FILES A LAWSUIT AGAINST ME BECAUSE IN MY OPINION THEY GAVE THEM A CONTRIBUTION AND THEN GOES TO SEE OBAMA. YOU SEE HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS, FOLKS? IT IS A BAD SYSTEM, LET ME TELL YOU.  SO OBAMA MEETS WITH THIS DOPEY  ERIC SNYDERMAN, WHO HATES OR UR GOVERNOR AND WANTS TO RUN FOR  GOVERNOR, BUT I DON'T THINK IT  IS GOING TO HAPPEN.  THEY GO UP TO SYRACUSE, MEETS  WITH OBAMA, AND HE FILES A LAWSUIT.  SO BOTTOM LINE IS THIS.  PEOPLE SAID YOU CAN SETTLE.  A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID BEFORE YOU  RUN YOU SHOULD SETTLE. I SAID I DON'T CARE.  THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IT.  AND THEY USE IT.  SO WHEN I HAVE 10,000 PEOPLE,  AND WHEN WE HAVE MOSTLY  UNBELIEVABLE REVIEWS, HOW DO YOU SETTLE?  AND IN FACT, WHEN THE CASE  STARTED ORIGINALLY, I SAID HOW  CAN I SETTLE WHEN I HAVE A  REVIEW LIKE THIS?  NOW I SHOULD HAVE SETTLED, BUT I  AM GLAD I DIDN'T.  I WILL BE SEEING YOU IN NOVEMBER  EITHER AS PRESIDENT.  AND I WILL SAY THIS.  I HAVE ALL THESE GREAT REVIEWS,  BUT I WILL SAY THIS.  I THINK THE JUDGE SHOULD BE  ASHAMED OF HIMSELF.  I THINK IT IS A DISGRACE HE IS  DOING THIS.  AND I LOOK FORWARD TO GOING  BEFORE A JURY, NOT THIS JUDGE,  AND WE WILL WIN THAT TRIAL.  WE WILL WIN THAT TRIAL.  CHECK IT OUT.  CHECK IT OUT, FOLKS.  NOVEMBER 28, I THINK IT IS  SCHEDULED FOR. IT SHOULD NOT BE A TRIAL.  IT SHOULD BE A SUMMARY JUDGMENT DISMISSAL.  ONE OF THE GREAT LAWYERS SAID  HOW DO YOU GET SUED UNDER RICO  FOR A GUY THAT TOOK THE COURSE,  LOVED THE COURSE, SAID GREAT  THINGS ABOUT THE COURSE, AND  THEN YOU GET SUED UNDER RICO?  IT IS A DISGRACE.  IT IS A RIGGED SYSTEM.  I HAD A RIGGED SYSTEM, EXCEPT WE  WON BY SO MUCH.  THIS COURT SYSTEM, THE JUDGES IN  THIS COURT SYSTEM, FEDERAL COURT.  THEY OUGHT TO LOOK INTO THAT  JUDGE BECAUSE WHAT HE IS DOING  IS A TOTAL DISGRACE. OK?  BUT WE WILL COME BACK IN  NOVEMBER. WOULDN'T THAT BE WILD IF I AM  PRESIDENT AND COME BACK AND DO A CIVIL CASE? EVERYBODY LIKES IT. OK.  THIS IS CALLED LIFE, FOLKS. HERE IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO.  WE ARE GOING TO RUN THIS COUNTRY PROPERLY WITH HEART, WITH PASSION. WE ARE GOING TO SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY. WE ARE GOING TO SAVE, WITHOUT CUTS, SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY. WE ARE GOING TO BRING BACK AND SAVE OUR MEDICARE, WHICH PEOPLE WANT TO CUT. WE'RE GOING TO KNOCK OUT -- REMEMBER THIS, KNOCK OUT COMMON CORE.  OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS A  MESS.   WE ARE GOING TO KNOCK  OUT COMMON CORE.  WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR  EDUCATION TO A LOCAL LEVEL, AND  WE ARE GOING TO DO GREAT.  REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMA CARE.  WE ARE GOING TO SAVE OUR SECOND AMENDMENT.   REMEMBER, REMEMBER.  CROOKED HILLARY WANTS TO ABOLISH  OUR SECOND AMENDMENT.  THE N.R.A. LAST WEEK GAVE ME  THEIR FULL ENDORSEMENT.  THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF  THE N.R.A., THE EARLIEST  ENDORSEMENT THEY HAVE EVER GIVEN.  AND I AM HONORED.  AND BY THE WAY, THEY ARE GREAT  PEOPLE.  THEY ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.  THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE.  WE ARE GOING TO START VERY SOON.  WE ARE GOING TO RENEGOTIATE OUR  TRADE DEALS THAT ARE KILLING OUR COUNTRY.  WE ARE GOING TO RENEGOTIATE WITH  CHINA.  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE BETTER  RELATIONSHIPS THAN WE HAVE RIGHT NOW.  WE ARE GOING TO RENEGOTIATE OUR  DEALS.  WE ARE GOING TO RENEGOTIATE EVERYTHING.  EVERYTHING IS UP FOR GRABS.  WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE  INCREDIBLE POTENTIAL THIS  COUNTRY HAS, WHEN WE ARE NOT RUN  BY PEOPLE WITH NO COMMON SENSE,  WITH NO BUSINESS ABILITY.  FRANKLY, WITH NO HEART.  THEY HAVE ZERO HEART, AND PEOPLE  THAT ARE INCOMPETENT.  WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE WHAT WE ARE  ABLE TO DO IN A FAIRLY QUICK TIME.  WE WON NEW YORK BIG.  WE WON EVERYTHING BUT WE WON NEW  YORK BIG.  NEW HAMPSHIRE WAS MY FIRST  VICTORY, SO I LOVE NEW HAMPSHIRE.  YOU LOOK AT THE STREAMS, THE  BEAUTIFUL TREES, AND THE RIVERS.  I LOVE YOU, TOO.  THANK YOU.  IT WAS MY FIRST VICTORY.  WE WON NEW HAMPSHIRE.  THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BUSH,  AND HE SPENT MANY MORE TIMES  THAN ME. WOULDN'T IT BE NICE TO HEAR AS A  PRESIDENT I HAVE SPENT LESS MONEY ON THIS CAMPAIGN THAN  ANYBODY ELSE BY FAR AND HAVE HAD  THE BEST RESULTS BY FAR?  ISN'T THAT NICE?   BUT ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WANT FOR YOUR PRESIDENT? AREN'T WE TIRED OF THIS HORRIBLE STUFF THAT WE WITNESS? EVERY SINGLE THING WE DO, OVER BUDGET, WAY BEHIND SCHEDULE. WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE IT. I'M BUILDING A HOTEL ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE BETWEEN THE  WHITE HOUSE AND THE CAPITOL BUILDING.  THE OLD POST OFFICE. IT IS TWO YEARS, BUT I LIKE TO SAY ONE YEAR. WE ARE OPENING IN SEPTEMBER A HOTEL AT LEAST 1.5 YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. UNDER BUDGET, AND YET IT IS A HIGHER-QUALITY HOTEL THAN ANYBODY EVER SAW BEFORE. I THINK IT WILL END UP BEING ONE OF THE GREAT HOTELS OF THE WORLD. WE ARE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, UNDER BUDGET. AND YET, WE HAVE INCREASED THE  SCOPE OF THE HOTEL.  AND IT IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING OUR COUNTRY IS PROUD OF. I MADE THE DEAL WITH THE GSA,  GOVERNMENT SERVICES.  ONE OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE  DEALS IN THE HISTORY OF  GOVERNMENT SERVICES.  THEY MADE IT FOR TWO REASONS.  NUMBER ONE, THEY WANTED TO MAKE  SURE IT GETS DONE.  THEY LOOKED AT MY BALANCE SHEET  AND ALMOST FELL OFF THEIR  CHAIRS.  THEY SAID IT WILL GET DONE.  THEY DON'T WANT A HALF BUILT HOTEL.  THE OTHER THING, THEY WANTED A  GREAT CONCEPT. WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THIS.  I LOVE OPENING IT ON SEPTEMBER  15. MAYBE I SHOULD WAIT UNTIL AROUND NOVEMBER 2 OR 3, BECAUSE THAT IS GOING TO BE A GREAT OPENING.  THE PROBLEM WITH YOU GUYS IS YOU TEND TO FORGET WE HAVE LIKE A  TWO-WEEK-SPAN, WE HAVE A  TWO-WEEK MEMORY SPAN.  I WILL OPEN UP LATER AND STILL  BE SO FAR.  BUT IT IS GOING TO BE FANTASTIC.  THAT IS WHAT SHOULD BE DOING FOR  OUR COUNTRY.  SEE OUR ROADS COMING IN SO FAR  ABOVE BUDGET.  WE DON'T BUILD BRIDGES FOR THE  MOST PART. IN THE OLD DAYS, WE USED TO BUILD BRIDGES.  YOU GO TO CHINA, BRIDGES ALL  OVER THE PLACE.  IT MAKES OUR BRIDGES LOOK LIKE TOYS.  BEAUTIFUL AIRPORTS. YOU GO TO MIDDLE EASTERN  COUNTRIES, THEY HAVE AIRPORTS  THE LIKES OF WHICH YOU HAVE  NEVER SEEN.  THE MOST INCREDIBLE STRUCTURES, THE MOST INCREDIBLE BUILDINGS. AND THEN WE FLY HOME AND LAND AT LAGUARDIA WITH POTHOLES ALL OVER THE RUNWAY.  IT IS TRUE. OR KENNEDY, NEWARK, OR L.A.X. AND IT IS A DISGRACE. WE HAVE BECOME A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY, FOLKS. AND IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANY LONGER. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANY LONGER.   SO WHAT HAPPENED IN INDIANA WAS AMAZING. WE WIN ALL THE STATES. NEW YORK, PENNSYLVANIA, RHODE ISLAND, DELAWARE, CONNECTICUT, MARYLAND.  AND BY THE WAY, WON EVERY COUNTY  IN EVERY STATE.  IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. WON BY LANDSLIDES, WHERE EVEN THE SLIME SITTING OVER THERE -- THEY CANNOT SAY IT ANYMORE  BECAUSE NOW WE ARE GETTING 78%.  THEY USED TO SAY, ""DONALD TRUMP  HAS NOT CRACKED 50%.  YES, HE HAS WON, BUT HE HAS NOT  CRACKED 50%.""  BOY ARE WE CRACKING 50% NOW.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, IN THE HISTORY  OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WE HAVE  RECEIVED MORE VOTES THAN ANYBODY  BY FAR.  BY MILLIONS.   AND WE HAVE 10 STATES  LEFT TO GO.  10 STATES.  AND THEY WILL NEVER SAY THAT.  THEY DON'T SAY THAT, SO I MIGHT  AS WILL TELL YOU.  YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION, IF YOU  DON'T TOOT YOUR OWN HORN, YOU  BETTER DO IT BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE  IS GOING TO DO IT FOR YOU?  THIS SLIME IS NEVER GOING TO DO IT.  I JUST READ A STORY BY A WOMAN  NAMED PARKER AND A WOMAN NAMED  PAPERMAN IN THE ""NEW YORK TIMES.""  INSTEAD OF SAYING DONALD TRUMP  WON THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, THEY  SAY, ""HIS STYLE OF NEGOTIATION  AND THE WAY HE RUNS AND THE FACT  HE DID THIS AND THAT.""  THEY SAY, ""THE REPUBLICAN PARTY -- "" THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS COMING  TOGETHER QUICKLY.  YOU JUST SAW DARRELL ISSA,  DUNCAN, ALL THESE PEOPLE.  THESE ARE THE BEST.  IT IS REALLY COMING TOGETHER QUICKLY.  WE ARE UP TO OVER 90% IN TERMS  OF APPROVAL RATES.  LAST TIME, WE HAD THIS CLOWN  NAMED MITT ROMNEY THAT LET US  ALL DOWN. I BACKED HIM AND WORKED FOR HIM.  JOHN MCCAIN LOST.  MITT ROMNEY LOST.  I SAID THIS TIME WE ARE GOING TO  DO IT OURSELVES. WE ARE GOING TO WIN.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN.  AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. BEFORE WE FORGET, WE HAVE WON THE NOMINATION BIG, BY NUMBERS YOU CAN'T BELIEVE. YOU HAVE GOT TO GO OUT AND VOTE IN TWO WEEKS ANYWAY BECAUSE WE WANT THE MANDATE. WE HAVE TO HAVE THE MANDATE.  THE STATE OF REPORTERS, WISEGUYS -- THESE TWO REPORTERS,  WISEGUYS, NOT TALENTED PEOPLE.  THEY SAY DONALD TRUMP IS HAVING  A HARD TIME BRINGING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TOGETHER.  WHY DON'T THEY SAY I WIN THE NOMINATION?  I GIVE THE VETS ALMOST $6 MILLION.  I DON'T HAVE TO GIVE THEM ANYTHING.  I GIVE A SPEECH, AND I SAY,  LET'S RAISE MONEY FOR THE VETS.  I WAS THINKING MAYBE WE WOULD  GET $1 MILLION.  WE ARE GIVING A FULL LIST ON TUESDAY.  BUT I GOT THESE GUYS.  I TAKE SOMETHING WHERE NOBODY  EVEN THINKS ABOUT IT.  YOU RAISE THIS FANTASTIC AMOUNT  OF MONEY.  I GIVE IT TO ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS.  INSTEAD OF PRAISE, THEY KNOCK YOU.  THESE TWO REPORTERS, AND THEY  ALWAYS PRETEND LIKE THEY ARE  YOUR FRIEND.  I CALL IT THE FAILING NEW YORK  TIMES.  IT IS A DISGRACE.  BY THE WAY, THE WASHINGTON POST  IS NOT MUCH BETTER.  THEY HAVE 22 PEOPLE ON ME RIGHT NOW.  I WILL TELL YOU WHY.  I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD IF YOU ARE A  VERY SUCCESSFUL PERSON, YOU  CANNOT RUN FOR OFFICE.  YOU ESPECIALLY CANNOT RUN FOR  PRESIDENT.  THE ""WASHINGTON POST"" HAS 22  PEOPLE ON ME NOW, 22 REPORTERS.  THAT IS BECAUSE THE PERSON THAT  OWNS THE ""WASHINGTON POST"" ALSO  HAS A BIG THING IN AMAZON, WHICH  IS A MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THING.  SO HE USES THE ""WASHINGTON POST""  FOR POWER AND HE THINKS HE WILL  GET THE POLITICIANS TO DO WHAT  HE WANTS, AND HE PROBABLY WILL.  BUT ME, I COULD NOT CARE LESS.  HE DOES NOT WANT TO PAY TAX ON  THE INTERNET.  HE WILL USE THAT SO THEY WILL  NOT TAX AMAZON ON THE INTERNET.  MEANWHILE, DEPARTMENT STORES ARE  GOING OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE IT  IS UNFAIR COMPETITION. NOW HE HAS A THREAT IN TERMS OF MONOPOLY. HE KNOWS I AM THE ONLY ONE THAT SAYS IT.  THE POLITICIANS ARE AFRAID TO  SAY IT BECAUSE HE OWNS THE ""WASHINGTON POST.""  THE OTHER DAY, I GET A CALL.  THEY HAD 22 GUYS SLOPPING ALL  THE STUFF TOGETHER, AND THEY ARE  DOING A BOOK THAT COMES OUT IN AUGUST.  MAKE SURE HE IS OK.  MAKE SURE HE IS PERFECT. ARE YOU OK?  MAKE SURE. WE LOVE THESE PEOPLE. MAY HAVE BEEN STANDING HERE FOR SIX HOURS.   THAT IS MY GREAT WORLD WAR II VET. THE PEOPLE LOOKING AT HIM DON'T REALIZE HE IS TOUGHER THAN ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM. THAT I CAN SAY.   I LOVE TO CALL THESE  INSTITUTIONS OUT.  NO POLITICIAN IS GOING TO DO  THAT BECAUSE THEY CARE TOO MUCH.  I CARE TOO, BUT I CARE ABOUT  DOING THE RIGHT THING.  THE ""NEW YORK TIMES"" LAST WEEK  MADE A FOOL OF THEMSELVES.  THEY DID A STORY ON THE FRONT  PAGE ON SUNDAY.  A MASSIVE PICTURE OF ME STANDING  WITH BEAUTY PAGEANT CONTESTANTS.  THEN THEY INTERVIEWED 50 OR 60 PEOPLE.  MOST OF THEM SAID GOOD THINGS.  THE FEW OF THEM REVOLTED, THEY  SAID THAT IS NOT WHAT WE SAID OR  IMPLIED. WE LIKE DONALD TRUMP.  WE LOVE DONALD TRUMP.  DONALD TRUMP TREATED US WITH RESPECT.  ONE OF THEM GOT MARRIED.  I SAID, ISN'T THAT TERRIBLE,  THAT STORY?  THEY WROTE IT VERY DISRESPECTFULLY. NOT VERY SERIOUS CHARGES, IN ALL FAIRNESS.  THEY WROTE IT VERY DISRESPECTFULLY. I SAW HER ON TELEVISION.  I SAW HER AGAIN ON TELEVISION.  SHE WAS SAYING IT WAS INCORRECT  WHAT THEY SAID.  WHAT THEY SAID WAS MEANT  MALICIOUSLY, AND I LIKE AND RESPECT DONALD TRUMP AND HE  ALWAYS TREATED ME GREAT AND YOU  SHOULD NOT WRITE LIKE THAT. AND THEN I HAD A VERY FANTASTIC YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS A VERY SUCCESSFUL MEMBER OF THE BEAUTY PAGEANTS. I SEE CARRIE IS HERE RIGHT NOW. WE LOVE CARRIE. SHE MARRIED A GREAT ATHLETE. THEY ARE STANDING TOGETHER. THEY ARE A GREAT COUPLE. CARRIE TOLD HIM WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND THEY MISCHARACTERIZED HER. THEY SAID THEY SPOKE TO HER AND NEVER SPOKE TO HER AND THEY WROTE FALSE STUFF.  THEY WROTE ABOUT ANOTHER ONE.  THAT WAS FALSE.  THEY WROTE ABOUT A CONSTRUCTION  WOMAN THAT WORKED FOR ME.  I GAVE HER THE BREAK OF A LIFETIME.  I LET HER BUILD A MAJOR BUILDING  IN NEW YORK CITY WHERE SHE WAS  THE CONSTRUCTION MANAGER.  PROBABLY NEVER HAPPENED TO A  WOMAN BEFORE.  I GAVE A WOMAN A BREAK.  MY FATHER SAID DONALD, DON'T DO THAT.  HE IS FROM THE OLD SCHOOL.  I SAID IT WILL BE GOOD.  HE SAID YOU ARE MAKING A  MISTAKE, DON'T DO IT.  I SAID IT WILL BE FINE. HE SAID WHATEVER YOU WANT, TO  LET HER DO IT.  I GAVE HER THE BREAK OF HER LIFETIME.  WHEN SHE LEFT, SHE WANTED TO  COME BACK BECAUSE THE GRASS IS  ALWAYS GREENER.  SHE LEFT.  NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN, SHE LOVES TRUMP.  FOR A LONG TIME SHE HAS WANTED  TO COME BACK, FOR MANY YEARS.  I LOVE E-MAILS. THEY NEVER GO AWAY.  YOU HEAR THAT, HILLARY?  THEY NEVER GO AWAY, HILLARY!   YOU KNOW, HILLARY IS  MISSING 30,000 E-MAILS.  I HAVE PEOPLE THAT WILL RETRIEVE THOSE E-MAILS.   I DON'T THINK THEY  WANT TO FIND THOSE E-MAILS  BECAUSE WHAT HILLARY HAS DONE IS  CRIMINAL, FOLKS. LET'S GET BACK TO THE ""NEW YORK TIMES.""  I GIVE HER THE BREAK OF A  LIFETIME. SHE WRITES A BOOK GLOWING ABOUT  DONALD TRUMP. SHE SAID SOME STRANGE THINGS. SHE SAID IN THE BOOK DONALD TRUMP IS NOT SEXIST. WHO WOULD SAY THAT? UNLESS YOU HAVE EVIL THOUGHTS. IS THAT CORRECT, CARRIE?  SHE PUTS IN THE BOOK SOMETHING  TO THE EFFECT THAT DONALD TRUMP  IS NOT SEXIST.  IT WAS A GOOD BOOK ABOUT ME.  SHE WANTS TO COME BACK, SO SHE  IS E-MAILING TO MY SECRETARIES  FOR YEARS. ""I WANT TO COME BACK, DONALD  TRUMP IS THE GREATEST."" ""HE IS NOT A SEXIST PERSON, HE  IS THE GREATEST PERSON.""  AND THEN SHE IS IN THE ""NEW YORK  TIMES"" SAYING I WAS A HORRIBLE PERSON.  ONE OF MY MEN SAID SHE HAD THE  MOST FOUL MOUTH OF ANY HUMAN  BEING I HAVE EVER SEEN.  SHE USED TO WALK INTO A GROUP OF  MEN AND START USING THE F WORD,  AND I HAD TO BRING HER INTO MY  OFFICE TO CALM HER DOWN.  SHE WAS GOING CRAZY.  SHE WRITES ALL THESE LETTERS  THAT TRUMP IS THE GREATEST.  AT LEAST SOMEBODY WILL SAY GOOD  BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW CARRIE  WOULD SAY GREAT AFTER READING  NEGATIVE STUFF.  I DID NOT KNOW ROANNE WOULD COME  OUT AND SAY GREAT AFTER READING  NEGATIVE STUFF.  THEN I SAW THIS ONE.  I SAY I GAVE HER A JOB NO OTHER  WOMAN WOULD BE GIVEN.  I WAS 25 YEARS AHEAD OF MY TIME  WITH WOMEN.  TO THIS DAY, I HAVE WOMEN MAKING  MORE MONEY FOR THE SAME JOB AS  MY MEN.  AND I'M HAPPY ABOUT IT.  AND I EXPECT A LAWSUIT ANY DAY  FROM THE MEN.  THEY WILL SUE ME BECAUSE THEY  ARE NOT MAKING IT, BECAUSE WE  ARE LIVING IN THAT KIND OF SOCIETY.  MY MEN WILL BE SUING ME ON  MONDAY MORNING BECAUSE THEY ARE  NOT MAKING AS MUCH.  I DON'T CARE BECAUSE WE ARE  DOING GREAT WITH WOMEN.  I DON'T BELIEVE THE POLLS.  WE ARE DOING GREAT WITH WOMEN. WOMEN FOR TRUMP, THANK YOU. WOW.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  I THINK WE ARE DOING GREAT. BY THE WAY, THE NUMBERS WITH WOMEN ARE GOING UP. WOMEN WANT TO SEE STRONG BORDERS.  THEY WANT TO SEE A STRONG  MILITARY. THEY WANT TO SEE STRENGTH. THEY WANT TO SEE STRENGTH. AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, THEY  WANT TO SEE JOBS. THEY WANT AN ECONOMY THAT WILL BOOM. EVERYBODY ADMITS THAT WHAT I  WILL DO FOR THE ECONOMY NOBODY ELSE CAN DO. SO HERE IS THE END RESULT. ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"" CALLS AND  THEY WANT TO MEET.  THEY MET.  THEY ARE SO EMBARRASSED.  WHO IS WITH THE ""NEW YORK TIMES?""  WHERE IS THE ""NEW YORK TIMES"" REPORTER?  I CALL IT THE FAILING NEW YORK TIMES.  THE ""NEW YORK TIMES"" WANTS TO MEET.  THEY MET WITH ONE OF MY GUYS.  THEY HAD A GOOD MEETING.  I THINK THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO  BE SUED IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH.  BUT THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY DISHONEST. ""THE NEW YORK TIMES,"" THE ""WASHINGTON POST.""  MOST OF THE PEOPLE.  SOME OF THEM ARE FINE.  NOT MANY, BUT SOME OF THEM ARE FINE.  WHEN SOMEBODY HITS YOU, YOU HAVE  TO FIGHT BACK.  YOU KNOW WHAT I SAID TO THIS BARBARA?  I HAD FRIENDS THAT CALLED ME AND  SAID YOU ARE NOT VERY COOL.  I SAID TO BARBARA, MAYBE YOU  SHOULD NOT BE EATING THAT PIECE  OF CANDY.   THAT IS A LITTLE  DIFFERENT THAN BILL CLINTON, I  THINK.   AND SHE SAID -- HERE IS A WOMAN THAT USED THE F BOMB  MORE THAN ANY OTHER PERSON I  EVER HEARD.  SHE SAID, ""HE WAS OBVIOUSLY  TALKING ABOUT MY WEIGHT.""  GIVE ME A BREAK.  WE ARE SO POLITICALLY CORRECT  NOW OUR COUNTRY IS DYING FROM WITHIN.  WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO BUSINESS.  WE HAVE TO REBUILD OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE GOT TO REBUILD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. REMEMBER THIS. ALMOST $5 TRILLION SPENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM TO FIX A ROAD RIGHT OUTSIDE THAT IS IN HORRIBLE SHAPE. OK?  WE CAN'T FIX OUR HIGHWAYS, OUR TUNNELS. AND WE ARE GOING TO GET IT GOING, FOLKS. YOU ARE GOING TO BE SO PROUD OF  YOUR COUNTRY ONCE AGAIN. SO HERE IS THE STORY. I CAME HERE, AND I AM LEADING IN  THE POLLS.  WE ARE LEADING IN ALMOST EVERY  POLL NOW.  IT IS SO GREAT.  I CAME HERE AND SAID  SPECIFICALLY -- WE WERE IN COSTA MESA.  WE HAD A TREMENDOUS RALLY.  WERE YOU THERE?  31,000 PEOPLE.  NOBODY EVEN SHOWED IT BECAUSE  THERE WERE A COUPLE OF THUGS  OUTSIDE BURNING THE AMERICAN  FLAG, HOLDING OTHER FLAGS UP IN  THE AIR.  THEY WERE BURNING AND STOMPING  ON A CAR, A POLICE CAR, STOMPING  ON IT.  BY THE WAY, DID YOU SEE WHEN HE  GOT OFF THE CAR?  HE BROKE HIS -- DID YOU SEE THAT?  HE TRIED TO PRETEND HE WAS NOT HURT.  THAT WAS ADRENALINE.  HE WAS HURT.  HE WALKED AWAY AND SAID THAT WAS PAINFUL.  ALL YOU SAW WAS THIS THUG AND  PEOPLE BURNING THE AMERICAN FLAG  AND HOLDING UP FLAGS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.  THESE ARE THUGS.  THEY HARDLY SHOWED THE RALLY  INSIDE WHERE WE HAD THE PARENTS OF YOUNG CHILDREN KILLED BY  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, WHERE WE HAD  THE MOST AMAZING LOVEFEST LIKE THIS.  EVEN MORE PEOPLE.  WE HAD THE MOST AMAZING LOVEFEST.  A FRIEND OF MINE CAME TO ME.  HE CAME TO DALLAS.  WE HAD 21,000 PEOPLE AT THE  MAVERICKS ARENA.  HE SAID, CAN I ASK YOU A  QUESTION? HOW DO YOU DO THIS?  YOU'RE GOING TO SPEAK IN FRONT  OF ALL THESE PEOPLE.  A VERY GOOD MUSICIANS SAID TRUMP  IS THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD  WITHOUT A GUITAR, MEANING  WITHOUT AN INSTRUMENT. I HAVE GOT TO STAND UP HERE BY MYSELF.  IF I BOMB, THEY WILL LET US KNOW  ABOUT IT.  HE SAID TO ME, HOW DO YOU DO THIS?  THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST  SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE IN THE  COUNTRY, IN THE WORLD.  HE LOOKED AT THIS MASSIVE AUDIENCE LIKE THIS TODAY AND  LIKE I HAD A LITTLE WHILE AGO IN FRESNO. HE LOOKED AT THIS MASSIVE AUDIENCE AND SAID, HOW CAN YOU GET UP THERE AND SPEAK? DO YOU HAVE NOTES? I SAY NO. DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING? I HAVE A GOOD HEAD, A GOOD MEMORY. I HAVE A VERY GOOD MEMORY. HE SAID, HOW DO YOU DO IT? I SAID, HONESTLY, IT IS NOT HARD BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH LOVE IN  THE ROOM. IT IS UNBELIEVABLE.  THERE IS LOVE IN THE ROOM.  WE WANT TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK.  WE ARE TIRED OF BEING THE STUPID  PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD. WE ARE TIRED OF IT, AND WE ARE  GOING TO END IT.  THANK YOU.  I LOVE ENDING THIS WAY.  WE ARE ON LIVE TELEVISION.  IT IS EMBARRASSING BECAUSE WE  GET CRAZY RATINGS, SO THEY TAKE  ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF US.  THEY PUT ME ON ALL THE TIME. LOOK AT ALL OF THE CAMERAS.  WHEN HILLARY COMES, YOU HAVE NO CAMERAS.  NOBODY WANTS TO WATCH.  IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT BECAUSE  YOU HAVE TO MAKE DIFFERENT SPEECHES.  YOU CANNOT BE ON LIVE TELEVISION  ALL THE TIME AND MAKE THE SAME  SPEECH BECAUSE PEOPLE SAY HE  SAID THAT THIS MORNING, HE SAID  THAT YESTERDAY.  THE NICE PART IS I CAN TALK  ABOUT CURRENT EVENTS.  I CAN TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE WE  MENTIONED BEFORE, THE T.S.A.,  HOW BADLY IT IS MANAGED.  I CAN TALK ABOUT OUR VETS, HOW  BADLY THINGS OVER THE LAST TWO  DAYS CAME DOWN.  OUR VETERANS ADMINISTRATION IS A  CORRUPT ENTERPRISE.  YOU OUGHT TO GET THE JUDGE TO  LOOK INTO THAT INSTEAD OF  WASTING EVERYBODY'S TIME SO HE  CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DONALD TRUMP.  HE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF.  HERE IS THE STORY, FOLKS.  I LIKE TO END IT THIS WAY.  HOW MANY WAYS CAN YOU END SOMETHING? SOMEBODY SAID ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN"" IS A NEGATIVE STATEMENT. I SAID IT IS A POSITIVE STATEMENT BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. LISTEN.  WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE AS A COUNTRY. WE DON'T WIN WITH OUR MILITARY, EDUCATION, ANYTHING. NOW THEY WANT TO TAKE YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT AWAY? THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE. I LOVE SAYING IT AND WE CANNOT DO IT ANY BETTER. WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN BIG-LEAGUE.   WE ARE GOING TO WIN  WITH OUR MILITARY.  WE ARE GOING TO KNOCK THE -- OUT  OF ISIS.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOR OUR  GREAT VETS.  THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TREATED PROPERLY.  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS GET BETTER  TREATMENT IN MANY CASES THAN OUR  VETERANS, AND THAT IS NOT GOING  TO HAPPEN.  SO WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOR OUR VETS.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN ON  EDUCATION.  NO MORE COMMON CORE.  BRING IT DOWN.  WE WANT IT LOCAL.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH HEALTH  CARE. WE ARE GOING TO WIN AT THE BORDER.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN AT TRADE.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH THAT  YOU PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE  CALLING YOUR PRESIDENT SAYING, ""PLEASE, MR.  PRESIDENT, WE DON'T WANT TO WIN ANYMORE.  YOU ARE WINNING TOO MUCH.  YOU'RE DRIVING US CRAZY.""  I'M GOING TO SAY I AM SORRY, BUT  WE ARE GOING TO KEEP WINNING AND  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I LOVE YOU.  THANK YOU.  I LOVE YOU, SAN DIEGO. GET OUT AND VOTE. GET OUT AND VOTE. WE ARE GOING TO WIN CALIFORNIA. GET OUT AND VOTE. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. ","Donald Trump Campaign Rally in San Diego, California"

THE FOLKS BEHIND US GOT -- BEHIND ME GOT US RIGHT OVER THE TOP FROM NORTH DAKOTA SYSTEM OF NORTH DAKOTA MADE A BIG STATEMENT AND I JUST REALLY  APPRECIATE IT. WE WILL NOT FORGET IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WANT TO THANK A VERY GOOD  FRIEND OF MINE, HAROLD HAMM. I GUESS WE CAN CONSIDER HAROLD THE KING OF ENERGY.  THERE'S NOBODY LIKE HIM. HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT IT THAN  ANYBODY THAT I KNOW. SO HAROLD, I WANT TO THANK YOU   FOR YOUR SUPPORT.  YOU'VE BEEN AMAZING RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. MY FRIEND FOR A LONG TIME. BEEN ON THE COVER OF EVERY   MAGAZINE, I THINK HE'S HAD AS MANY COVERS AS I HAVE, MAYBE MORE, HAROLD. CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. OK, FOLKS. YES, JOHN.    IS THAT RIGHT? HE USED A BAD WORD BECAUSE HE  KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT BUSINESS.  WHEN YOU RATTLE SOMEONE THAT'S GOOD.  MANY OF THE WORLD, AS YOU KNOW, MANY OF THE COUNTRIES IN OUR WORLD, BEAUTIFUL WORLD, HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY ABUSING US AND   TAKING ADVANTAGE OF US.  SO IF THEY'RE RATTLED IN A FRIENDLY WAY, WE'RE GOING TO   HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE COUNTRIES. IF THEY'RE RAT NLED A FRIENDLY   WAY, THAT'S A GOOD THING, JOHN,  NOT A BAD THING.  HE'S A PRESIDENT WHO  HAS DONE A HORRIBLE JOB,   EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT.  HE'S A PRESIDENT WHO ALLOWED MANY OF THOSE COUNTRIES TO TAKE  ADVANTAGE OF HIM AND US UNFORTUNATELY. HE'S GOT TO SAY SOMETHING. IT'S UNUSUAL THAT EVERY TIME HE  HAS A PRESS CONFERENCE HE'S  TALKING ABOUT ME. 10 YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS. I WILL SAY THIS. HE IS A MAN WHO SHOULDN'T BE REALLY, YOU KNOW, AIRING HIS DIFFICULTIES. SHOULDN'T BE AIRING WHAT HE'S AIRING WHERE HE IS RIGHT NOW AND I THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IT STOP PRETTY SOON. HE HAS NOT DONE A GOOD JOB. TODAY WE'RE GIVING A BIG SPEECH ON ENERGY. WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME AMAZING THINGS HAPPEN WITH OUR COUNTRY   ON ENERGY. AND I LOOK FWRD TO DOING IT. BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA, YOU KNOW  YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED, YOU SEE WHERE WE'RE GOING, WE'RE A   DIVIDED COUNTRY. WE HAVE TREMENDOUS DIFFICULTY,   TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS. WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THOSE   PROBLEMS, GOING TO SOLVE THEM FAST.  WE DON'T DO IT FOR ANY SPECIFIC REASON. WE'RE LOOKING FOR ABSOLUTE   COMPETENCE.  I FULLY EXPECT THAT WE WILL HAVE MP WOMEN INVOLVED WITH NOT ONLY  -- I MEAN, I'VE HAD IT WITH THE  CAMPAIGN BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MANY WOMEN INVOLVED. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT AND SEE THAT VERY STRONGLY.  SO I LOOK FORWARD TO IT. AND I KNOW HE WAS MISCOATED --   MISQUOTED A COUPLE OF TIMES. HE'S BEEN MISQUOTED A LOT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE WOMEN  INVOLVED AT THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST LEVELS.  I'M NO PICKUP TRUCK. WE'RE RAISING MONEY LARGELY FOR THE PARTY. WE'RE RAISING IT FOR SENATORS,   CONGRESSMEN, CONGRESSWOMEN, FOR  A LOT OF PEOPLE RUNNING. WE WANT TO GO IN AND HAVE MAJORITIES.  IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS STAFF OF PEOPLE, LAST NIGHT WE RAISED IN  LOS ANGELES, WE RAISED A LOT OF  MONEY FOR THE PARTY. AND THIS IS MONEY THAT'S GOING   INTO THE R.N.C.  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE, I THINK, A TREMENDOUS, WE'RE GETTING  THANKED ALL OVER BY THE  REPUBLICAN SENATORS, BY CONGRESSMEN. AND HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO   RAISE A LOT OF MONEY.  THIS IS MONEY BEING RAISED FOR THE PARTY. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A  TREMENDOUS SUCCESS.  I'M ALSO CONTINUING TO FUND BIG PORTIONS OF MY CAMPAIGN.  I'M RELEASE, WHEN WE'RE FINISHED WITH THE AUDIT, THE I.R.S. HAS BEEN VERY   PROFESSIONAL AND CONTINUE TO BE  VERY PROFESSIONAL. WHEN THEY FINISH, I'VE BEEN  AUDITED FOR 15 YEARS AND I DON'T KNOW OF VERY MANY PEOPLE THAT  HAVE BEEN AUDITED FOR 15 YEARS.  I'M AUDITED ALL THE TIME.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S ALL   ABOUT. THE I.R.S. HAS BEEN VERY PROFESSIONAL.  AS WE MOVE ALONG, AS SOON AS   THAT'S FINISHED, WHENEVER THAT   MAY BE, HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE   BEFORE THE ELECTION. I'M FINE WITH THAT.  I DO. YES. DAVID.  I LIKE HER IN THE RACE.  I WANT TO RUN AGAINST HER. SHE HAS BAD JUDGMENT.  THIS WAS ALL BAD JUDGMENT. PROBABLY ILLEGAL, WE'LL HAVE TO  FIND OUT WHAT THE F.B.I. SAYS  ABOUT IT.  CERTAINLY IT WAS BAD JUDGMENT. I JUST READ THE REPORT. IT'S DEVASTATING, THE REPORT. IT'S DEVASTATING. THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT.  IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, SKIRTING ON THE EDGE ALL THE TIME. AND YOU LOOK BACK AT HER HISTORY AND THIS IS HER HISTORY. IT'S A VERY, VERY HARSH REPORT.  DONE REALLY BY DEMOCRATS.  APPOINTED BY OBAMA, AND DONE BY DEMOCRATS. SO IT'S SHOCKING TO SEE IT.  SHOCKING TO SEE WHAT SHE DID.  REALLY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IT'S BAD JUDGMENT. BUT THAT'S UP TO HER WHETHER OR NOT SHE WANTS TO CONTINUE RUNNING.  I HAVEN'T YET. I THINK I WILL. I HAVEN'T HAD THE SUPPORT OF THE GOVERN I DON'T HAVE OF NEW   MEXICO. SHE WAS ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S SIDE. I IMAGINE SHE'LL COME OVER TO MY SIDE.  IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED,  TREMENDOUS SUPPORT FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. SENATORS, CONMEN, GOVERNORS ALL  OVER THE PLACE. VAST MAJORITIES, I THINK THE APPROVAL IS UP TO OVER 90%. THAT'S TREMENDOUS FROM WHERE IT STARTED. LITTLE WHILE AGO IT WAS LIKE 62%. BUT I WON THE ELECTIONS IN   LANDSLIDES.  VERY IMPORTANT TO SAY. YOU LOOK AT THESE ELECTIONS, WE GO TO NEW YORK, WIN ALMOST 62%   OF THE VOTE WITH THREE PEOPLE  RUNNING. WE THEN GO TO PENNSYLVANIA.  WHICH IS GOING TO BE, I THINK, A STATE WE'RE GOING TO DO AMAZINGLY WELL.  HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO PUT THE COAL MINERS OUT OF BUSINESS,   WANT TO PUT THE STEEL MILLS OUT OF BUSINESS. I THINK I'LL WIN PENNSYLVANIA  EASILY.  WE HAVE TREMENDOUS SUPPORT THERE. MARYLAND, CONNECTICUT, WE WIN DELAWARE, RHODE ISLAND.  AND THEN WE WIN, AS YOU KNOW, WE HAD A TREMENDOUS, TREMENDOUS SUCCESS WHERE WE WENT TO INDIANA. THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. BOBBY KNIGHT HELPED, BUT WE'RE GOING TO WIN INDIANA BIG.  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TREMENDOUS   SUCCESSES. BUT YOU KNOW, THE THING I THINK  I'M MOST PROUD OF, NOT THE FACT  THAT I'M WATCHING HILLARY INSTEAD OF HILLARY WATCHING ME.  WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE GOING INTO JULY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE  SAID IT WOULDN'T BE SOLVED   DURING THE CONVENTION. THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW CONVENTION IN AUGUST. HERE I AM WATCHING HILLY FIGHT AND SHE CAN'T CLOSE THE DEAL.  AN THAT SHOULD BE SUCH AN EASY   DEAL TO CLOSE. BUT SHE'S UNABLE TO CLOSE THE  TEAL. SO I'M WATCHING HER. AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.  I'M GOING TO HAVE TO  LOOK AT IT INDIVIDUALLY AND I  WILL BE DOING THAT. A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ASKED ME, I   WILL BE DOING THAT.  OK. THANK YOU.  MY MESSAGE IS WE'VE   HAD TREMENDOUS SUPPORT FROM  ALMOST EVERYBODY.  EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT CONGRESS, THE SUPPORT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. AND I SPOKE WITH PAUL RYAN LAST  NIGHT. WE HAD A VERY GOOD CONVERSATION THAT'S MOVING ALONG. HE'S A GOOD MAN. WE'LL SEE HOW THAT ALL WORKS OUT. JUST, WE HAD A VERY GOOD TALK. I DON'T READ ""HUFFINGTON POST."" WAS THERE AN ARTICLE? I'M SURE HE WAS MISQUOTED BUT IT IS -- I DIDN'T THINK THEY COVERED POLITICS, DO THEY COVER POLITICS?  ALL RIGHT. THEY LOOK AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT  THINGS. WE HAVE A BIG PROBLEM. WE HAVE A RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM PROBLEM. IT'S A WORLDWIDE PROBLEM.  NOT JUST THIS COUNTRY. AND WE HAVE TO FIND A SOLUTION. AND WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT. WE HAVE TO BE TOUGH AND SMART. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.  I'D LOVE TO DEBATE BERNIE. HE'S A DREAM. I SAID, I SAID LAST NIGHT ON JIMMY'S SHOW, IT WAS A QUESTION  THAT WAS POSED. I SAID I'D LOVE TO DEBATE HIM  BUT I WANT A LOT OF MONEY TO BE  PUT UP FOR CHARITY.  IF WE CAN RAISE FOR MAYBE  WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES OR SOMETHING. IF WE CAN RAIDS $10 MILLION OR   $15 MILLION FOR CHARITY, WHICH   WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT.  I UNDERSTAND THE TELEVISION  BUSINESS REALLY WELL.  IT WOULD BE GET HIGH RATINGS. IT SHOULD BE IN A BIG ARENA. WE COULD HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH  IT.  THE PROBLEM WITH DEBATING  BERNIE, HE'S GOING TO LOSE. HIS SYSTEM IS RIGGED JUST LIKE   OUR SYSTEM IS RIGGED.  IF I DIDN'T WIN BY MASSIVE   MAJORITIES, I WOULDN'T BE  STANDING HERE TALKING TO YOU TODAY. YOU KNOW, I KNOCKED OUT EVERY OPPONENT.  YOU HAVE TO KNOCK OUT. AND BERNIE, UNFORTUNATELY, HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO KNOCK OUT. BUT THE SUPER DELEGATES FOR THE DEMOCRATS, SO UNFAIR.  SO THE PROBLEM, THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE IS THAT BERNIE IS NOT GOING TO WIN.  BUT I'D DEBATE HIM ANYWAY IF   THEY WANTED TO PUT UP MONEY FOR CHARITY. WE'LL SEE. WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF CALLS FROM THE NETWORKS ALREADY.  AND WE'LL SEE. HE'S THE ONE THAT SUGGESTED,   LET'S DEBATE.  I WOULD LOVE. TO I LOVE DEBATING. I KNOW YOU PEOPLE -- ON EVERY POLL, EVERY SINGLE DEBATE, IN  THE ONLINE POLLS AFTER EVERY   SINGLE DEBATE, I WON EVERY SINGLE DEBATE. MOLL DECISIONS ARE ALL TALK, NO ACTION. I'VE NEVER DEBATED PROFESSIONALLY.  I RAN AGAINST ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT DEBATED PROFESSIONALLY. BUT ACCORDING TO EVERY SINGLE  ONLINE POLL AFTER THE DEBATES, I WON EVERY SINGLE DEBATE, BY  EVERY SINGLE POLL. I DON'T MIND DEBATING. I LIKE TO DEBATE.  THE ONE THING WAS, I SAID TO MYSELF, I WONDER HOW WELL I'LL   DEBATE?  GUYS LIKE THIS GREAT GENTLEMAN RIGHT HERE, ONE OF THE GREAT   OILMEN OF THE WORLD, WE'RE NOT   DEBATERS, WE'RE PEOPLE THAT PUT PEOPLE TO WORK AND DO THINGS, AND A LOT OF GOOD THINGS.  HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU HAVE  WORKING FOR YOU? TENS OF THOUSANDS. THAT'S WHAT HE DOES. NOW I'D RATHER DEBATE HAROLD BUT I WILL TELL YOU, HE MAY SURPRISE YOU. HE MAY DO VERY WELL. BUT WE DON'T DO THAT. BUT SOMEHOW IT WORKED OUT WELL   FOR ME. IT WORKED OUT WELL FOR ME. I LOVE THE DEBATING PROCESS. A LOT OF FUN.  I WAS ON CENTER STAGE FOR EVERY  SINGLE D BAIT AND THE ONLY TIME  I WAS UPSET WITH SOME NETWORKS WAS WHEN WE HAD EVEN NUMBERS,  LIKE EIGHT, SO YOU HAD TWO IN THE MIDDLE. I INSISTED ON HAVING ODD NUMBERS. I THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT   SHOULD GET OUT OF THE WAY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS IN THE WAY. WE HAVE SO MUCH POTENTIAL ENERGY THAT PEOPLE WOULDN'T EVEN  BELIEVE IT.  MY SPEECH TODAY IS ON ENERGY. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS, AND IS.  THE FROTH, THE REGULATIONS THAT  THEY HAVE, THEY PUT THE COAL   MINERS OUT OF BUSINESS. THE COAL MINES ARE SHUT. WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO THE COAL -- WHAT HILLARY CLINTON, SHE'S  WORSE THAN OBAMA.  SHE OPENLY SAID, I WANT TO PUT   THE COAL MINERS OUT OF BUSINESS. WANT TO PUT THE COAL MINES OUT   OF BUSINESS. SHE'S SAYING I WANT TO PUT THE STEEL MILLS OUT OF BUSINESS. WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY  BUSINESSES LEFT SYSTEM OF  HILLARY IS, I THINK, I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW SHE COULD POSSIBLY DO WELL IN A PLACE LIKE  PENNSYLVANIA. SHE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DO VERY   WELL IN WEST VIRGINIA. AND YOU KNOW, I THINK SHE MADE A BIG MISTAKE. SHE'S CATERING TO CERTAIN PEOPLE BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY JOBS AND THESE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE --   PEOPLE, THE MINERS, THEY'RE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. I ASKED A COUPLE OF THEM, WHY  DON'T YOU GO INTO A DIFFERENT  PROFESSION?  BECAUSE WE LOVE GOING AFTER  COAL.  I'LL NEVER FORGET THE ANSWER.  YOU KNOW, YOU THINK IT'S   DANGEROUS AND YOU'RE GOING DEEP DOWN INTO THESE INCREDIBLE CREVICES, I SAY, WOW.  BUT THEY LOVE DOING WHAT THEY  DO. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. IT'S LIKE ME, YOU KNOW, I GREW   UP, MY FATHER WAS IN REAL ESTATE, I'M IN REAL ESTATE, NOW  I'M IN POLITICS. HE'S LOOKING DOWN SAYING WHAT  HAPPENED? BUT COAL MINERS LOVE DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING. HILLARY -- AND IT'S SUCH AN  IMPORTANT PRODUCT. HILLARY CLINTON SHOULDN'T BE PUTTING THEM OUT OF BUSINESS.  I WANT TO BE ENERGY INDEPENDENT, YES. I WANT TO BE ENERGY INDEPENDENT. AND I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HAROLD ABOUT THAT, BUT I WOULD SAY  ENERGY INDEPENDENCE IS WHAT WE ALL WANT.  WE ALSO WANT TO SELL OUR ENERGY TO OTHER PLACES THAT DON'T HAVE  THE GREAT NATURAL RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. DON'T FORGET, THROUGH MODERN DAY TECHNOLOGY, WE FOUND OUT THAT  WE'RE SITTING ON ENERGY, I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT IT IN  A MINUTE.  WE'RE SITTING ON ENERGY LIKE NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE.  I WANT TO BE ENERGY INDEPENDENT AND THE ANSWER IS YES TO YOUR QUESTION.  WE'LL SEE WHAT  HAPPENS.  AT THIS MOMENT I'M VERY UNHAPPY, WHEN I LOOK AT THE WORLD OF RADICAL ISLAM. WE'RE GOING TO FIND THE PROBLEM AND COME UP WITH A SOLUTION. OBAMA COULD NEVER COME UP WITH A SOLUTION. NUMBER ONE, HE'S INCOMPETENT AND NUMBER TWO, THE SOLUTION JUST IS NEVER GOING TO BE OUT THERE FOR  HIM. HE WON'T EVEN MENTION, HE WON'T EVEN MENTION THE WORDS RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. I HAVE MANY MUSLIM FRIENDS, THEY SAID TO ME, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THIS IS A PROBLEM. IT'S A PROBLEM THAT HAS TO GET SOLVED.  AND WE HAVE TO HAVE TURN-INS. WHEN YOU SEE LOOKING TO DO   TREMENDOUS DESTRUCTION, LIKE IN  CALIFORNIA WITH 14 PEOPLE KILLED, THEY LIVED IN A HOUSE  WHERE THEY HAD BOMBS ALL OVER THE FLOOR. EVERYBODY KNEW THEY WERE UP TO   BAD STUFF. NOBODY REPORTED THEM.  PEOPLE HAVE TO REPORT WHEN THEY  SEE. GO AHEAD.  YES, I WOULD. IT SHOULD BE APPROVED. I'M NOT SAYING IT WOULDN'T BE A BETTER DEAL. OBAMA WOULD APPROVAL IT OR NOT APPROVE IT. HILLARY IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO APPROVE IT FROM WHAT I   UNDERSTAND. BUT I LOOK AT IT DIFFERENTLY. I WILL ABSOLUTELY APPROVE IT 100% BUT I WANT A BETTER DEAL. HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  HAROLD HAMM AND MYSELF AND YOU,  OR LET'S SAY OBAMA, WHO DOESN'T  KNOW WHAT THE HELL HE'S DOING. HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE. I'M GOING TO SAY, FOLKS, WE'RE   GOING TO LET YOU BUILD THE PIPELINE BUT GIVE US A PIECE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO USE IMMINENT DOMAIN. REMEMBER WHEN CONSERVATIVES SAID, EMINENT DOMAIN, EMINENT DOMAIN. THEIR FAVORITE PROJECT IS THE  KEYSTONE PIPELINE. IF YOU READ THING TO BE YUMETS ON KEYSTONE PIPELINE, A WHOLE BIG PART IS EMINENT DOMAIN. I WANT THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE BUT THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES  SHOULD BE GIVEN A PIECE, A   SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF THE PROFITS. RIGHT NOW OBAMA WOULD HAVE SAID YES OR NO. AND MOST POLITICIANS WOULD SAY YES, WE'LL APPROVE IT OR NO WE   WOULDN'T. I WILL SAY YES, WE ABSOLUTELY  WILL APPROVE IT, I WANT IT   BUILT, BUT I WANT A PIECE OF THE PROFITS BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING IT  POSSIBLE FOR IT TO HAPPEN  THROUGH EMINENT DOMAIN AND OTHER THINGS.  I WANT A PIECE OF THE PROFITS  POTH UNITED STATES.  THAT'S HOW WE'LL MAKE OUR  COUNTRY RICH AGAIN. JUST ONE WAY OUT OF THOUSANDS. THAT'S HOW WE'LL MAKE OUR  COUNTRY RICH AGAIN AND IT'S HOW  WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA  GREAT AGAIN. YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?  TWO OF THEM THAT ARE  VERY, VERY IMPORTANT ARE LOWEST  TAXES. WE'RE THE HIGHEST TAXED NATION   IN THE WORLD BY FAR. LOWER TAXES AND THE OTHER ONE IS WE'RE OVERREGULATING. I WILL TELL YOU, I MADE A SPEECH LAST NIGHT IN FRONT OF A GROUP.  I SAID REGULATION, THIS  SURPRISED ME, I'VE SEEN IT EVER  SINCE I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR LIKE 10 MONTHS OR SO.  AND REGULATION IS EVEN MORE OF A PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE THAN THE  TAXES, WHICH SURPRISED ME. BUT THEY'RE BOTH PROBLEMS. WE'RE GOING TO -- UNDER MY PLAN, WE'RE LOWERING TAXES SUBSTANTIALLY FOR BUSINESSES, FOR MIDDLE INCOME, FOR   EVERYBODY. TAXES ARE GOING WAY DOWN. WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW TRILLIONS   OF DOLLARS TO POUR INTO THE  COUNTRY THAT ARE RIGHT NOW   OUTSIDE OF THIS COUNTRY WHERE  PEOPLE AND COMPANIES WANT TO   BRING IT IN, THEY CAN. WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF THE TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF RULES, REGULATIONS, PROBABLY 75% OF WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE  FOR OUR COUNTRY. OK. WHO POCAHONTAS. IS IT OFFENSIVE? YOU TELL ME. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT IS THAT   WHAT YOU SAID? ELIZABETH WARREN.  SHE TWEETS A LOT ABOUT ME. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I TWEET. WHEN I TWEET, NOT THAT MANY  PEOPLE ARE WATCHING OUR TWEETS. WHEN -- HER TWEETS.  WHEN I TWEET, THEY WATCH.  I WILL SAY THIS. SHE'S A SENATOR THAT'S HIGHLY OVERRATED. SHE'S PASSED VERY LITTLE LEGISLATION. SHE HAS BEEN A REAL DISASTER FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING THE DEMOCRATS WHO FRANKLY CAN'T STAND HER, MANY OF THE   DEMOCRATS. JUST ASK HILLARY CLINTON HOW SHE LIKES HER. I WOULD SAY THIS, I'LL DEBATE ANYBODY. I'D DEBATE HER.  BUT SHE'S DONE VERY LITTLE FOR MASSACHUSETTS. AND THE BEAUTIFUL THING IS, WHEN I WON MASSACHUSETTS WITH MANY  PEOPLE RUNNING AGAINST ME, I GOT UP TO ALMOST 50%. AND SHE WAS FIGHTING ME. SO I REALLY THINK IF HER RECORD  WAS EXPOSED, AND THE FACT THAT   SHE WAS A NATIVE AMERICAN SHE  SAID SHE WAS NATIVE AMERICAN BUT SHE WASN'T ABLE TO DOCUMENT IT, SHE SAID, I HAVE HIGH  CHEEKBONES, I HAVE HIGH CHEEKBONES, I'M A NATIVE   AMERICAN. SHE THEN, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D  CALL IT A FRAUD OR NOT, SHE WAS  ABLE TO GET INTO VARIOUS SCHOOLS BECAUSE OF THE FACT, SHE APPLIED AS A NATIVE AMERICAN AND PROBABLY ABLE TO GET OTHER   THINGS. I THINK SHE'S AS NATIVE AMERICAN AS I AM, OK. THAT I WILL TELL YOU. BUT SHE'S A WOMAN THAT'S BEEN VERY INEFFECTIVE. OTHER THAN SHE'S GOT A BIG MOUTH. OK. YEAH, GO AHEAD, IN THE BACK.  ON TUESDAY WE'LL BE   RELEASING A TREMENDOUS LIST OF ALL THE MONEY WE'VE GIVEN. WITH THE DEBATE, WHEN I DECIDED  I WANT TO DO THIS INSTEAD OF GO  TO A PARTICULAR DEBATE WITH A  CABLE NETWORK THAT ACTUALLY HAS BEEN UNBELIEVABLY FAIR OVER THE  LAST FEW MONTHS, I HAVE TO SAY. BUT I FELT I WASN'T TREATED RIGHT. I DID A SPEECH AND DURING THE SPEECH I SAID, LET'S SEE IF WE   CAN RAISE MONEY FOR THE VETS. WE RAISED A LOT OF MONEY. ON TUESDAY, I THINK WE'LL HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE IN TRUMP TOWER, TUESDAY AT PROBABLY 10:00 OR 11:00. AND WE'RE GOING TO RELEASE A FULL LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE, ALMOST $6 MILLION OF MONEY WAS   RAISED.  I STARTED IT, WE WEREN'T GOING   TO RAISE ANYTHING, IT WAS JUST   AN IDEA THAT CAME TO ME. I SAID, LET'S RAISE SOME MONEY   FOR AT THE VETS. ONE OF MY FRIENDS WHO WAS THERE, VERY SUBSTANTIAL PERSON, PHIL RUFFIN, OFFERED A MILLION DOLLARS. KARL ICAHN GAVE HALF A MILLION. ANOTHER GOOD FRIEND GAVE A MILLION. ALL OF A SUDDEN WE STARTED   GETTING A LOT OF MONEY. I LOVE SEEING IT.  ON TUESDAY, WE'RE GOING TO   RELEASE A LIST OF ALL THE  DIFFERENT VETERANS GROUPS THAT GOT THE MONEY. CLOSE TO, PRETTY CLOSE TO $6 MILLION WORTH OF MONEY. THAT WAS GREAT. WHAT I DO -- THIS DEBATE, I'D  LIKE TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR   WHERE THEY'LL PAY, IN THIS CASE, JUST A PAYMENT, WHY SHOULD THE   NETWORKS HAVE A DEBATE BY THIS   MAKE A FORTUNE, SELL IT TO   SPONSORS, PUT THE MONEY IN THEIR COFFERS. I WOULD MUCH RATHER GIVE AND   PROBABLY IN THIS CASE TO VARIOUS GROUPS INVOLVED WITH WOMEN'S   HEALTH ISSUES. I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE.  I'M SO HONORED TO BE IN NORTH DAKOTA. SO HONORED BY THESE PEOPLE, THEY HAVE SUCH GREAT SENSE. RIGHT?  WE'LL HAVE MANY   THINGS TO DO.  I'LL BE UNWINDING VARIOUS EXECUTIVE ORDERS, PARTICULARLY   THOSE DEALS WITH THE BOARD WRER  PEOPLE ARE POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY THAT AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. WE'LL BE UNWINDING THAT. WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO DO.  WE'LL START REBUILDING THE MILITARY.  WE HAVE NO CHOICE. IT'S NOT LIKE, OH, GEE, DO YOU   WANT TO DO IT? WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR MILITARY BIGGER, BETTER, STRONGER THAN  EVER BEFORE. I SAY -- I SAW THE OTHER DAY, ON CNN, WHERE THE JET FIGHTERS WERE USING PARTS FROM MUSEUMS AND GRAVE YARDS, PLANE GRAVE YARDS,  WHERE THEY'RE TAKING OLD PARTS   OUR OUR FIGHTERS, AND THEY WERE INTERVIEWING SOME OF THE PILOTS, GREAT PEOPLE. THEY WERE SAYING THEY'RE SO EMBARRASSED AND ASHAMED OF   WHAT'S GOING ON. THIS SHOULDN'T BE THE UNITED   STATES.  SO WE'RE GOING TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY.  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE FINEST   EQUIPMENT IN THE WORLD AGAIN. AND NOBODY IS GOING TO MESS WITH US.  VERY SIMPLE. BY THE WAY, I'M THE LAST PERSON IN TERMS OF THE DRAW, I WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE DRAW.  I'M THE LAST PERSON. I DIDN'T WANT TO GO INTO IRAQ, UNLIKE HILLARY AND OTHER PEOPLE. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE INTO IRAQ.  IT WAS A MISTAKE. THE WAY OBAMA GOT US OUT WAS A   TREMENDOUS MISTAKE.  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF FUN THAT FIRST 100 DAYS. WE'RE GOING TO START THE PROCESS OF MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. HOW ABOUT A COUPLE MORE.  ONE OF THE REASONS I  MADE A DEAL WITH THE R.N.C.  WHICH TO ME, I THINK THEY'VE   DONE A GOOD JOB. BUT THEY'VE BUILT OVER YEARS AND YEARS STAFFS IN EVERY STATE. YOU CAN'T DO THAT IF YOU'RE  DOING IT ALL OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS.  SO NOW I JUST LEARNED I GOT THE  NOMINATION AND AGAIN THIS WAS  SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING TO  HAPPEN, ACCORDING TO SOME PEOPLE IN AUGUST AND SOME PEOPLE WERE   SAYING, BECAUSE OF THE SECOND  CONVENTION WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN RIDICULOUS AND MANY PEOPLE SAID IT WAS GOING TO GO INTO THE  JULY.  AND THEN WE HAD THAT MASSIVE VICTORY IN INDIANA. WON'T FORGET THE -- WON'T FORGET THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA, THAT WAS A MASSIVE, MASSIVE VICTORY.  AND YOU KNOW, SO HERE I'M  SITTING. I'M WATCHING.  I LOVE WATCHING HILLARY AND BEXAR KNEE GO AT IT. BERNIE HAS GIVEN ME SOME GREAT   LINES, WHICH I'M USE, BELIEVE  ME.  BUT I WILL SAY THAT AS FAR AS  BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF A CAMPAIGN, THE R.N.C. HAS BEEN  DOING IT FOR MANY YEARS. ALL OVER THE COUNTRY THEY HAVE VERY GOOD PEOPLE.  PART OF THE BENEFIT IS WE GET TO USE THOSE PEOPLE. WHILE I'M RAISING A LOT OF MONEY FOR THEM, THEY'RE GOING TO USE THAT NOT ONLY FOR ME BUT FOR   OTHER PEOPLE RUNNING FOR OFFICE, IT'S BEEN AN HONOR BECAUSE I'VE MET SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN  DIFFERENT STATES. I MET A BIG GROUP OF PEOPLE LAST NIGHT FROM DIFFERENT STATES THAT WORK ESSENTIALLY FOR THE R.N.C.  AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT OVER A   PERIOD OF JUST A SHORT WHILE.  YOU KNOW, WE HAVE, NOVEMBER IS IT'S GOING TO BE VERY SOON.  AND THEY ARE SET UP WITH GREAT INFRASTRUCTURE. OK.  HOW ABOUT ONE OR TWO MORE?  A QUESTION WAS ASKED ABOUT VINCE FORRESTER. I HAVEN'T KNOWN ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  AND SOMEBODY ASKED ME THE  QUESTION THE OTHER DAY.  AND I SAID THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE  ARE SKEPTICAL AS TO WHAT   HAPPENED AND HOW HE DIED.  I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT. I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING -- UNLESS THERE'S EVIDENCE CONTRARY WHAT I'VE SEEN I DON'T THINK IT  SHOULD BE PART OF THE CAMPAIGN.  IF YOU PEOPLE REVEAL SOMETHING TO ME, I'LL ANSWER IT THE APPROPRIATE WAY. OK.  ONE MORE. YEAH?  RIGHT.  HILLARY IS GOING TO ABOLISH THE SECOND AMENDMENT. HE'S GOING TO ABOLISH YOUR RIGHT TO OWN GUNNS.  SHE'S GOING TO ABOLISH THE SECOND AMENDMENT.  I'M EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE.  I GOT THE ENDORSEMENT FROM THE N.R.A. BECAUSE THEY'RE GREAT,  AMAZING PEOPLE.  I'M A MEMBER OF THE N.R.A. MY SONS ARE MEMBERS OF THE N.R.A. BUT THEY WANT TO ABSOLUTELY KNOCKOUT FRACKING. YOU DO THAT, YOU'RE GOING TO BE  BACK INTO THE MIDDLE EAST AND  WE'RE GOING TO BE BEGGING FOR  OIL AGAIN. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. NOT WITH ME. WE'RE GOING TO OPEN IT UP. WE'RE GOING TO BE ENERGY INDEPENDENT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ALL SORTS OF ENERGY INCLUDING SOLAR.  AND I KNOW A LOT ABOUT SOLAR. THE PROBLEM WITH SOLAR, IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE. WHEN YOU A 30-YEAR PAYBACK THAT'S NOT THE BEST IN THE WORLD. I'VE GONE SOLAR BUT IT'S A VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE THING.  WIND IS VERY EXPENSIVE. WIND -- WITHOUT SUBSIDY, WIND  DOESN'T WORK. AND THERE ARE PLACES MAYBE FOR WIND.  BUT IF YOU GO TO VARIOUS PLACES IN CALIFORNIA, WIND IS KILLING ALL OF THE EAGLES. IF YOU SHOOT AN EAGLE THEY WANT TO PUT YOU IN JAIL FOR FIVE YEARS. AND YET THE WINDS ARE KILLING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF EAGLES, ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL, TREASURED BIRDS AND THEY'RE  KILLING THEM BY THE HUNDREDS AND NOTHING HAPPENS. WIND IS A PROBLEM. IT'S VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE AND IT DOESN'T WORK WITH OUR SUBSIDY. DESPITE THAT, I AM INTO ALL TYPES OF ENERGY. WHILE WE'RE IN NORTH DAKOTA, I   HAVE TO SAY THIS, I LOVE THE   FARMERS. AND THE FARMERS ARE INCREDIBLE. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS WAS LARGELY A FARM STATE.  THEY PRODUCE TREMENDOUS CROPS OF TREMENDOUS DIFFERENT GOODS OF  WHICH I EAT A LOT OF THEM. AND I JUST WANT TO PAY MY  RESPECTS TO THE FARMERS OF NORTH DAKOTA BECAUSE THEY HAVE DONE A  GREAT JOB. ALL RIGHT. ONE MORE.  GO AHEAD.  WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THAT AND  WE'RE GOING TO MEET WITH THE   GOVERNOR OF IOWA WHO'S A TREMENDOUS GUY AND A FRIEND OF   MINE. AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT.  A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT THAT TO   HAPPEN. WE WILL BE MAKING A DECISION FAIRLY SOON. OK?  >> GIVEN THE LOW VOLUME OF CRUDE OIL AND REGULATIONS WERE LIFTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO INCREASE  AND STIMULATE GROWTH?  THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.  LET'S SEE WHAT  HAPPENS. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.  THANK YOU.",Presidential Candidate Donald Trump News Conference

BOY.  YOU KNOW, CHRIS PAID   OFF HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN DEBT  TONIGHT, HIS ENTIRE DEBT. CHRIS, YOU CANNOT EVEN GIVE HIM A TABLE AND A SEAT. TERRIBLE. A GREAT GUY AND A GREAT   GOVERNOR. I LOVE YOU TOO.   LOOK AT THIS  I WANTED TO KNOW A   LITTLE BIT.   HE HAS BEEN MY FRIEND A LONG  TIME AND DONE A GREAT JOB.  I SAID, LET'S BE SPECIFIC. WE ARE GOING TO BE SPECIFIC. I SAID, GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION, AND BOY, DO I LOOK   FORWARD TO DEBATING HILLARY. WON'T THAT BE FUN?  I SAID, LET'S BE SPECIFIC.  GOVERNOR CHRISTIE, YOUR GOVERNOR, BALANCED THE BUDGET SIX TIMES WITHOUT RAISING TAXES.  NOT EASY TO DO.   ENACTED A $2.3 BILLION JOB  CREATING TAX CUT. THAT IS A LOT OF STUFF.  $2.3 BILLION, NOT EASY IN NEW   JERSEY, I CAN TELL YOU.   HE SHRANK THE STATE GOVERNMENT BY 6,500 JOBS.  GOVERNOR CHRISTIE, THERE IS NO  SUCH THING AS BIPARTISAN ANYMORE.  IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING, ACTUALLY.   ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ACT WILL   CREATE 27,000 JOBS, 22,000 IN   THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.  A LOT OF MY FRIENDS ARE HERE TONIGHT.  WE ARE ALL IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.   GOVERNOR CHRISTIE CONTRIBUTED   MORE TO THE PENSION SYSTEM THAN   ANY OTHER GOVERNOR IN NEW JERSEY  STATE HISTORY.  GOVERNOR CHRISTIE BROUGHT THE   INSOLVENT -- AND THIS WAS   IMPORTANT -- THE INSOLVENT NEW  JERSEY UNEMPLOYMENT TRUST FUND  BACK TO SOLVENCY.   I CAN TELL YOU IT WAS DONE AT   LEAST TWO YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.   THAT IS A PRETTY GOOD TRACK   RECORD, AND THAT IS JUST A FEW  OF THE THINGS.  THAT IS JUST A FEW.   WE HAVE HAD AN INTERESTING TIME.   YOU KNOW, IT ALL STARTED, AND   CHRIS WAS OUT THERE, I WAS OUT  THERE, AND ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING PARTS WAS I WAS   WATCHING THE DEBATE. I HAD ONE DEBATE I WAS  INTERESTED. I WAS WATCHING. I LIKE MARCO VERY MUCH. CHRIS WAS OVER HERE. I WAS STANDING THERE, I WATCHED IT HAPPEN. HE LOOKED LIKE PERRY MASON THAT   EVENING. IT WAS A ROUGH EVENING FOR MARCO. MARCO WILL ADMIT IT. THAT WAS A ROUGH, ROUGH EVENING.  SO THIS BEGAN --     THERE IS NOTHING LIKE  NEW JERSEY.  THERE IS NOTHING LIKE  NEW JERSEY.   SO MANY WISEGUYS.   IF YOU CAN MAKE IT IN NEW   JERSEY, YOU CAN DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING YOU WANT IN LIFE.  GREAT PEOPLE.   ON JUNE 7, WILL YOU DO ME A   FAVOR?  GO OUT AND VOTE, PLEASE.  GO OUT AND VOTE.  BOY, ARE WE GOING TO GO OUT IN NOVEMBER.   JUNE 7.   ON JUNE 16 -- WE WILL BUILD THAT WALL.   THE WALL IS GOING TO BE BUILT.  WE WANT THE WALL.   HILLARY -- YOU TALK ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS. BERNIE.   I LOVE THIS CROWD.  THIS IS GREAT.  MY PEOPLE.  THIS IS MY PEOPLE.  BUT BERNIE SANDERS SAID THAT  HILLARY REALLY IS, ESSENTIALLY, NOT FIT TO BE PRESIDENT. SHE'S NOT QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW WHY?   HE SAID BECAUSE SHE SUFFERS FROM  BAD JUDGMENT. SO TODAY, SHE MADE THIS STATEMENT. SHE WILL NOT USE THE TERM  ""RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM."" YOU KNOW WHY SHE WON'T? BECAUSE HER PRESIDENT WON'T USE IT, THAT IS WHY. BY THE WAY, IS SHE BEING NICE TO HIM?  SHE COULD NOT STAND HIM, HER HUSBAND COULD NOT STAND HIM. BILL COULD NOT STAND HIM, AND SHE COULD NOT STAND HIM.  I WONDER WHY SHE IS BEING SO  NICE. CAN YOU FIGURE IT OUT?  DID NOT LIKE HIM ONE LITTLE BIT,  NOW ANYTHING HE SAYS, MY PRESIDENT SAID, MY PRESIDENT SAID.   IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, LOOK AT  IT, HE SAID ""UNQUALIFIED,"" AND  SHE SUFFERS FROM BAD JUDGMENT.   AND SHE DOES.   TODAY, WE HAD A TERRIBLE  TRAGEDY, AND SHE CAME UP AND  SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP TALKED   ABOUT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM.  SHE USED A DIFFERENT TERM   BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT WANT TO USE  THAT TERM.  SHE REFUSES TO USE THAT TERM.   IT IS A TERRIBLE THING.   HE ESSENTIALLY SHOULD NOT BE  RUNNING FOR OFFICE.   HE DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO   RUN FOR OFFICE. I SAID TO MYSELF, WHAT JUST HAPPENED 12 HOURS AGO?  A PLANE GOT BLOWN OUT OF THE  SKY.  IF YOU DO NOT THINK IT WAS BLOWN  OUT OF THE SKY, YOU ARE 100% WRONG. AND IT'S GETTING WORSE.   I WAS WATCHING ONE OF THE   NETWORKS.   THEY HAD THIS GREAT GUY FROM THE  FBI ON, TALKING ABOUT WHAT  HAPPENED WITH THE PLANE.  NEVER SAW HIM BEFORE ON   TELEVISION.   HE IS GOING BACK AND FORTH ABOUT  HOW BAD IT IS GETTING, HOW WE   ARE LOSING CONTROL.   AT THE END, HE SAYS, LET ME TELL  YOU SOMETHING.  THE PERSON THAT KNOWS WHAT IS   GOING ON, THE PERSON THAT   UNDERSTANDS WHAT IS HAPPENING,  IS A GUY NAMED DONALD TRUMP.  THAT WAS A GREAT HONOR.   THANK YOU.  THANK YOU.  IF YOU'RE SITTING AT HOME AND WATCHING TELEVISION,  YOU HAVE A MAN WHO IS AN EXPERT   ON TERRORISM, THAT, TO ME, IS A   GREAT COMPLIMENT. ON JUNE 16, I CAME DOWN THAT BEAUTIFUL ESCALATOR AT TRUMP TOWER. THIS IS NICE, BUT IT DOES NOT REMIND ME OF THIS ONE. IT WAS A BIG DAY. I JUST SAID, WE HAVE TO DO IT. THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE CAN DO TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE ARE NEVER GOING TO DO IT. IF HILLARY CLINTON GETS IN, I DO  NOT KNOW IF OUR COUNTRY CAN EVER  RECOVER.  YESTERDAY, I NAMED A LARGE  NUMBER OF JUDGES, AND I WILL BE   ADDING TO THAT, THAT ARE HIGHLY   RESPECTED JUDGES. THEY COME OUT OF HERITAGE,  DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT HAVE  RECOMMENDED VERY STRONGLY.  THEY REALLY RECOMMENDED STRONGLY. THESE ARE GREAT JUDGES. WE WILL BE ADDING ADDITIONAL  ONES, CHRIS.  IT IS OUTSTANDING.  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT   THINGS, ALWAYS SECURITY FIRST, RIGHT?  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS  WE WILL BE DOING, WHOEVER THE   NEXT PRESIDENT IS, IS NAMING JUDGES.   PROBABLY NAMING THE JUSTICES OF   THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.  THEY WILL TAKE US IN A CERTAIN  DIRECTION, EITHER DOWN THE  TUBES, OR THROUGH THE ROOF.   I WILL TELL YOU, THROUGH THE ROOF.   THE JUDGES, THE JUSTICES, SOME  OF THEM ARE CURRENTLY JUDGES,   ALL OF THEM ARE CURRENTLY   JUDGES, THE JUSTICES OF THE   UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, IT   COULD BE THREE, COULD BE FIVE,  PROBABLY GOING TO BE THREE, MOST  LIKELY THREE, FOUR, COULD EVEN  BE FIVE, THAT IS A MASSIVE  NUMBER OF JUSTICES.   WHOEVER WINS, HILLARY HAS GOTTEN  TOTALLY EMBROILED IN THIS.  HOW BAD A JUDGMENT IS THE E-MAIL  SCANDAL?  FOR WHAT REASON DID SHE DO  THAT? I KNOW THE REASON.  I KNOW THE REASON. IT IS ALWAYS THE SAME WITH HER.  IT IS ALWAYS THE SAME WITH THEM.   BUT -- I HAVE USED THAT ONE   ALREADY.  I CANNOT USE IT. I MIGHT USE IT AGAIN.   WE WILL GO CROOKED HILLARY,   OK?   CROOKED MAY BE MORE ACCURATE,   MAYBE. SHE IS PROBABLY GOING TO GET OUT BECAUSE, I MEAN, YOU KNOW -- WHAT SHE HAS DONE IS SO MUCH  WORSE THAN WHAT ANYBODY ELSE  RUNNING EVER, EVER, HAS   DONE.   IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE PEOPLE,  GENERAL PETRAEUS, THEY HAVE DONE  RUINED. WHAT SHE HAS DONE, WHAT SHE HAS   DONE, FOR HER TO BE ABLE TO   HOW BAD A JUDGMENT IS THE E-MAIL  SCANDAL? FOR WHAT REASON DID SHE DO  THAT? I KNOW THE REASON.  I KNOW THE REASON.  IT IS ALWAYS THE SAME WITH  HER.  IT IS ALWAYS THE SAME WITH  THEM.   BUT -- I HAVE USED THAT ONE   ALREADY.  I CANNOT USE IT.  I MIGHT USE IT AGAIN.   WE WILL GO CROOKED HILLARY,   OK? CROOKED MAY BE MORE ACCURATE, MAYBE.  SHE IS PROBABLY GOING TO GET OUT  BECAUSE, I MEAN, YOU KNOW -- WHAT SHE HAS DONE IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN WHAT ANYBODY ELSE  RUNNING EVER, EVER, HAS DONE.   IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE PEOPLE, GENERAL PETRAEUS, THEY HAVE DONE A TINY FRACTION OF WHAT SHE HAS DONE.   THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN RUINED.   WHAT SHE HAS DONE, WHAT SHE HAS   DONE, FOR HER TO BE ABLE TO   CONTINUE TO RUN IS AN ABSOLUTE  DISGRACE, IN MY OPINION, TO THIS  COUNTRY. ABSOLUTE DISGRACE. ON TOP OF THAT, YOU KNOW, IT IS   AN AMAZING THING. EVERY TIME I WATCH THE RACE,  BERNIE SANDERS WINS. HE KEEPS WINNING. THEN THEY HAVE THE ROUNDTABLE. WELL, HILLARY CLINTON WILL WIN. IT IS A RIGGED DEAL. I STARTED USING THE WORD ""RIGGED."" NOBODY USED THE WORD ""RIGGED"" AND NOW EVERYBODY IS   CALLING IT RIGGED.  I WANT TO HAVE THAT PHRASE COINED.   I USED THE WORD FOUR OR FIVE  MONTHS AGO.   THE REPUBLICAN DEAL WAS RIGGED,   100%.   WHAT DID I DO?  YOU HAVE TO WIN BY MASSIVE NUMBERS.  BOY, DID WE GET MASSIVE NUMBERS.  WE DID WELL.  YOU KNOW, I HAD, BY FAR, THE  MOST DELEGATES.   I CAME INTO NEW YORK, AND THE   PEOPLE OF NEW YORK, THEY LOVE   ME.   YOU KNOW ME AS WELL AS THEY KNOW ME.   I AM PAYING SO MANY PEOPLE.   I HAVE SO MANY EMPLOYEES IN NEW JERSEY.   I HATE TO THINK ABOUT IT, I HAVE  TO BE HONEST.   I AM TAKING CARE OF MORE  EDUCATION AND MORE SALARIES AND   MORE HEALTH CARE THAN ANYBODY,  PROBABLY, IN NEW JERSEY.  HONESTLY, I AM HAPPY TO DO  IT.   WE HAVE GREAT PEOPLE.   NEW JERSEY, LET ME TELL YOU, NEW  JERSEY IS A GREAT STATE.  IT IS A STATE WHERE WE HAVE   TRULY, TRULY GREAT PEOPLE. I CAME INTO NEW YORK.   AND WE DID NOT WIN BY A LITTLE BIT.  WE WON IN A MASSIVE LANDSLIDE.  WE WON EVERYTHING.  THE NICE PART IS THEY KNOW ME   THE BEST.   IF YOU GO INTO A COMMUNITY AND  YOU DO NOT DO WELL, THAT IS NOT   A GOOD SIGN.  THEY HAVE KNOWN ME FOR SO MANY  YEARS, THEY ARE PROBABLY SICK OF  ME.   I GOT 62%.  WE JUST KNOCKED THEM, AND IT WAS GREAT.  I GO TO PENNSYLVANIA, GREAT PLACE. CONNECTICUT.  WE WILL DO GREAT IN PENNSYLVANIA.   WE HAVE OUR CHAIRMAN FROM   PENNSYLVANIA. WE GO TO PENNSYLVANIA, CONNECTICUT, DELAWARE, MARYLAND AND RHODE ISLAND.   WE WON EVERY SINGLE SUBSECTION OF EVERY SINGLE STATE.  WE WON EVERY COUNTY OF EVERY  STATE, AND WE WON EVERYTHING BY   MASSIVE NUMBERS. AND DON'T FORGET I GOT 66% AND 67%. DON'T FORGET I HAVE THREE PEOPLE RUNNING. WHEN THESE GUYS ON TELEVISION, THE MOST DISHONEST HUMAN BEINGS  -- THEY ARE THE WORST.   DONALD TRUMP, WE GOT SEVEN OR EIGHT PEOPLE, NINE PEOPLE RUNNING. DONALD TRUMP DID NOT GET 50%.  HOW DO YOU GET 50%? SOMETIMES I HAVE -- YOU KNOW, WE STARTED OFF WITH 17 PEOPLE. AND ACTUALLY ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS BECAUSE I WON NEW   HAMPSHIRE WHICH IS AMASTING.  SO I WENT THROUGH THE  NEXT WEEK.  I WIN NEW YORK IN A   LANDSLIDE. THEN I WIN FIVE STATES.   THEN I AM WATCHING AND I AM   HEARING THAT I GOT SOMETHING, A   LITTLE LESS, SAYING I SHOULD  HAVE DONE BETTER. THEN I GO TO INDIANA.   THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE  FIREWALL.   WE WENT THERE, AND WE WON   INDIANA SO BIG, EVERYBODY JUST  GAVE UP.  WE HAD A LITTLE HELP.   IT WAS A MAN NAMED BOBBY KNIGHT.   WE LOVE BOBBY.  WE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE.   WE HAD A GREAT COACH FROM PURDUE.   WE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT   REALLY SUPPORTED.   WHEN BOBBY KNIGHT, WHO WON 900  GAMES, THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS, LAST  UNDEFEATED TEAM IN COLLEGE CHAMPIONSHIPS, ALMOST TWO, HE WAS A GREAT COACH.  IS A GREAT COACH. HE LOOKS BETTER THAN EVER.  HE CAME OUT, AND I WANT TO TELL   YOU THAT STATE WENT CRAZY. THAT WAS GOOD.  IF EVER THERE WAS AN ENDORSEMENT  THAT WAS GOOD, WE WON INDIANA IN  A LANDSLIDE. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN AMAZING CONVENTION. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE GREAT TRADE DEALS. WE ARE GOING TO STOP WITH THIS NONSENSE. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE GREAT TRADE  DEALS, YOU KNOW, WITH CHINA. WE HAD A TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA OF $505 BILLION A YEAR. HOW STUPID CAN WE BE? OBAMA DOES NOTHING ABOUT IT, HILLARY KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT,   HAS ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA. SHE IS TAKEN CARE OF BY THE PEOPLE PUTTING UP HER MONEY.  EVEN IF SHE DID, SHE WOULD SAY,   I CANNOT DO THAT.   I CANNOT HURT THESE PEOPLE. THEY GAVE ME MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THE GREAT  TRADE DEALS OUT OF ABSOLUTE   DISGUSTING, THE ABSOLUTE WORST  EVER NEGOTIATED BY ANY COUNTRY  IN THE WORLD.   THAT IS HOW BAD THEY ARE.   THEY ARE TAKING OUR JOBS, TAKING  OUR MONEY, OUR EVERYTHING.  TO ME, THE MOST INTERESTING, I  LOVE NEW YORK.  BUT I REALLY TOURED THIS STATE  LIKE I NEVER DID BEFORE.  I WENT TO ALBANY, SYRACUSE,   ROME, NEW YORK, THE REAL ROME.   I WENT TO SUFFOLK.  WE DID SO GREAT.  I LOOKED AT FACTORIES AND I   LOOKED AT BUILDINGS THAT WERE   ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE TO LOOK AT.   THEY WERE CRUMBLING. YOU COULD SEE 20 YEARS AGO, 25  YEARS AGO, YOU COULD SEE VIBRANCE.   TODAY, YOU CAN BUY THEM FOR TWO DOLLARS.  I WENT TO PENNSYLVANIA AND I  LOOKED AT PLACES -- BY THE WAY,   IN PENNSYLVANIA, A WEEK BEFORE,   WE HAVE HILLARY SAYING SHE IS   GOING TO PUT THE MINERS AND COAL  MINES OUT OF BUSINESS, OK?  WHEN I WON NEW YORK,   IT WAS INTERESTING, I SAID, WE  WILL PUT THE MINERS BACK TO WORK.   A FEW WEEKS LATER, I WENT TO  WEST VIRGINIA.  I HAD REALLY GOOD NUMBERS IN  WEST VIRGINIA. I DID NOT SAY IT FOR THAT   REASON, BUT WE ARE GOING TO PUT PEOPLE BACK TO WORK.  WE ARE GOING TO USE OUR POWER OF TAXATION. WHEN A COMPANY MOVES TO MEXICO AND THEY THINK THEY ARE GOING TO DROP OUT LIKE CARRIER, LIKE FORD, NABISCO, THEY THINK THEY ARE GOING TO FIRE OUR PEOPLE, MOVE TO MEXICO, MAKE THEIR AIR CONDITIONERS AND SELL THEM ACROSS THE BORDER, NO TAX, NO NOTHING, GUESS WHAT, FOLKS? NOT GOING TO WORK THAT WAY ANYMORE.   NOW, I AM A FREE   TRADER.   I AM ONLY A FREE TRADER IF WE   MAKE GOOD DEALS.  THESE VERY CONSERVATIVE IDEOLOGUES SAY, DONALD TRUMP IS   NOT A FREE TRADER.  HOW ABOUT JEB BUSH?   DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A   CONSERVATIVE. I AM A CONSERVATIVE, BUT WHO CARES?  SOMEBODY ASKED ME YESTERDAY, ARE  YOU A FREE TRADER? HERE IS WHAT I AM.  IT WAS SEAN HANNITY LAST NIGHT.  NICE GUY.   DO WE LOVE SEAN?  HERE IS MY TRADE DEAL.   I SAID, HERE IS WHAT WE ARE   GOING TO DO.  MY TRADE DEAL IS VERY SIMPLE.   HERE IS WHAT IT IS.   I AM GOING TO MAKE GREAT DEALS  FOR OUR COUNTRY.  VERY SIMPLE.  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE GREAT DEALS  FOR OUR COUNTRY. CALL IT FREE TRADE, WHATEVER YOU  WANT TO CALL IT, WE ARE GOING TO  MAKE GREAT DEALS FOR OUR COUNTRY.  I CAN TELL YOU THIS -- WHEN   CARRIER AND FORD AND NABISCO ARE  LEAVING CHICAGO -- THEY ARE   LEAVING THEIR PLANT AND MOVING TO MEXICO.  I AM NOT EATING OREOS.  NEITHER IS CHRIS.   NO OREOS FOR EITHER OF US.  I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, FOLKS.  THERE HAS TO BE CONSEQUENCES. WHEN THEY MOVE, THERE HAS GOT TO  BE CONSEQUENCES. I WATCHED FOR SIX YEARS AS THE  UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, ON A FEDERAL BASIS, WORKED VERY HARD. THEY WANTED TO LOAN MONEY TO COMPANIES, GIVE THEM LOW INTEREST LOANS.   SOME COMPANIES TOOK THE MONEY   AND MOVED ANYWAY. THEY WANT TO COME UP WITH IDEAS.  HERE IS MY IDEA.  SO SIMPLE. THEY WORKED ON IT FOR SIX YEARS.  MEANTIME, LOOK AT NEW YORK, NEW   JERSEY, BY THE WAY, LOOK AT   DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, WHAT NAFTA HAS DONE TO US, SIGNED BY BILL CLINTON BY THE WAY, SIGNED BY BILL CLINTON, THE FIRST TRADE DEAL, IN MY OPINION,  IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY,  ONE OF THE WORST EVER.  AND IT IS GOING TO BE REPEALED, BELIEVE ME.   IT IS GOING TO BE CHANGED OR  TOTALLY RENEGOTIATED, PROBABLY REPEALED.   PROBABLY REPEALED, PROBABLY.  HERE IS WHAT WE ARE DOING.  CARRIER MOVES.  WE ARE SAYING, HI, CARRIER, HOW   ARE YOU DOING?  CHRIS, AS PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES, AM I ALLOWED TO  CALL THE PRESIDENT OF AN  AIR-CONDITIONING COMPANY? HE SAID, ONLY ONE TIME.   ONLY TAKES ONE CALL.  MY WIFE WOULD SAY, DO NOT DO  THAT.   YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT.  BUT IT IS SO MUCH FUN FOR ME.   I WOULD CALL THESE COMPANIES AND  SAY, YOU HAVE LET GO OF   THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND LEFT  INDIANA, CHICAGO, ALL THE   DIFFERENT PLACES, MICHIGAN.   I WILL WIN MICHIGAN. WE WILL WIN ILLINOIS.   WE WILL WIN THESE THINGS.   I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR  YEARS. THESE OTHER GUYS TALK ABOUT IT, AND IT WILL NOT WORK OUT SO WELL.   WE ARE GOING TO WIN MICHIGAN BIG, WATCH WHAT HAPPENS.  I SAY, YOU WANT TO MOVE YOUR  PLANT? ENJOY MEXICO.   BEAUTIFUL PLACE, BEAUTIFUL  WEATHER, 120 DEGREES, WONDERFUL.  BUT EVERY UNIT YOU MAKE AND SELL  TO THE UNITED STATES, YOU ARE   GOING TO PAY A 35% TAX, OK?  VERY SIMPLE.   HERE IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.   SOME CONSERVATIVES WILL SAY,  THAT IS NOT FREE MARKET.  WE ARE LOSING OUR SHIRTS,   FOLKS.  WE DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. IF I SAW CARRIER BEFORE THEY  MOVE, I WANT TO GET IN QUICKLY, BEFORE THEY MOVE, I WOULD SAY,  YOU MOVE, ENJOY YOURSELF. YOU WILL PAY A 35% TAX. THEY ARE NOT MOVING.  VERY SIMPLE. THEY ARE NOT MOVING.  IF IT IS TOO LATE, I AM CHARGING  THESE COMPANIES A TAX.  YOU KNOW WHAT? WE ARE GETTING KILLED. WE ARE LOSING ALL OF OUR JOBS, OUR EVERYTHING.   AT LEAST THE UNITED STATES WILL   MAKE A HELL OF A LOT OF MONEY. THESE DUMMIES SAY IT IS A TRADE WAR.  WE ARE LOSING $500 BILLION IN TRADE WITH CHINA.   WHO THE HELL CARES?  $500 BILLION, AND THEY ARE TELLING ME ABOUT A TRADE WAR. TWO THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. CHINA DEVALUES THEIR CURRENCY.   THEY ARE BEHAVING VERY  BADLY.  ON TOP OF THAT, THEY ARE  BUILDING FORTRESSES IN THE SOUTH  CHINA SEA.  THEY ARE DOING THINGS.  CHINA WILL BEHAVE.  CHINA WILL BE OUR FRIEND. WE WILL DO BETTER WITH CHINA UNDER ME AND WE WILL ALSO DO  BETTER ECONOMICALLY UNDER   ME.   THEY WILL RESPECT OUR COUNTRY   ONCE AGAIN.   I WAS TOLD YESTERDAY BY AN  IMPORTANT PERSON THAT CHINA IS  CONCERNED ABOUT DONALD TRUMP  BEING ELECTED.  BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?   THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY UP.   THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.  LOOK, A LOT OF YOU DO  NOT KNOW THE WORLD OF ECONOMICS,  AND YOU SHOULD NOT EVEN BOTHER.   LEAVE IT TO ME.   JUST GO AND ENJOY YOUR LIFE.  BUT CHINA IS KILLING US, AND SO   ARE OTHER COUNTRIES, WITH THE   DEVALUATION OF THEIR CURRENCY.   THEY ARE MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE   FOR OUR COMPANIES TO COMPETE.  THEY ARE DOING IT MORE THAN   EVER, WORSE THAN EVER.  NINE MONTHS AGO, THEY DID A   DEVALUATION THEY WERE NOT   SUPPOSED TO DO, THE BIGGEST   DEVALUATION IN 20 YEARS, TWO  DECADES.  NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE,  FOLKS. THEY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US.   IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN   ANYMORE. WHEN COMPANIES MOVE, DIFFERENT SITUATION, AND THEY WANT TO MOVE  TO A DIFFERENT PLACE, IN PARTICULAR MEXICO, WHICH IS   BECOMING A MINI VERSION OF  CHINA, WE WILL BE FRIENDLY WITH   THE MEXICAN PEOPLE.   I EMPLOY THOUSANDS OF   HISPANICS.  WE ARE DOING GREAT IN THE POLLS.  THE HISPANICS THAT ARE HERE   LEGALLY DO NOT WANT THEIR HOUSES  TAKEN AWAY, THEIR JOBS TAKEN AWAY.   THAT IS WHY I AM DOING WELL WITH  THE HISPANICS.  WE ARE DOING GREAT WITH THE   AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THEY KNOW I AM GOING TO CREATE JOBS.   I'M GOING TO BRING BACK   JOBS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE THE STUPID COUNTRY ANYMORE.   BELIEVE ME.   WE ARE VIEWED AS THE STUPID COUNTRY. WE ARE LIKE A BIG, BIG, SLOPPY BULLY THAT GETS PUNCHED IN THE  FACE AND GOES DOWN.   YOU EVER SEE A BULLY GET KNOCKED OUT?  IT IS A TERRIBLE THING, UNLESS  YOU DO THE PUNCHING. WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THINGS. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE GREAT TRADE DEALS. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TREMENDOUS BORDERS.  WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME IN   LEGALLY.  WE NEED THE WALL FOR DRUGS.   TWO WEEKS AGO, 16,500 BORDER  PATROL AGENTS ENDORSED ME.  I CALLED THEM AND SAID TO THEM,   FRANKLY, BECAUSE THESE ARE GREAT  PEOPLE, THEY WERE TOLD TO STAND   BACK.   THEY WANT TO DO THE JOB.  THEY ARE FANTASTIC PEOPLE.  THEY CAN DO A GREAT JOB.  WHEN THEY ENDORSED ME, I SAID, DO WE NEED THE WALL?  YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR ANSWER WAS?  MR. TRUMP, WE ABSOLUTELY NEED THE WALL.   I JUST WANTED TO BE SURE.  ]   CROWD CHANTING ""BUILD THE WALL""]  BECAUSE I SAID TO  THEM, I WANT TO BUILD A WALL.   WHO KNOWS BETTER THAN THE BORDER  PATROL?   THAT IS WHAT THEY DO.   THEY SAID, MR. TRUMP, ABSOLUTELY.   IT IS ANOTHER TOOL, AND THERE   ARE OTHER THINGS, BUT YOU   ABSOLUTELY NEED THE WALL. IT NEEDS TO BE A REAL WALL, NOT   THE LITTLE TOY WALL.  THAT CEILING IS PEANUTS, FOLKS.  IF THEY EVER GET UP, THEY ARE   GOING TO SAY, OH, MAN, HOW DO I   GET DOWN?   WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT BIG.  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT   POWERFUL. AND WE ARE GOING TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY BECAUSE OUR MILITARY IS  BEING DECIMATED.  DID ANYBODY SEE THE BIG PIECE ON  TELEVISION LAST WEEK WHERE OUR  FIGHTER PILOTS ARE GOING TO   JUNKYARDS -- THIS IS THE UNITED STATES.   OUR FIGHTER PILOTS AND FIGHTER  PLANES ARE GOING TO JUNKYARDS,  WHERE THEY HAVE JUNKYARDS FOR   THE OLD, BROKEN DOWN PLANES.  THEY ARE STRIPPING THE PLANES   APART AND PUTTING THEM ON OUR   20-YEAR-OLD FIGHTER PLANES.   WE ARE LIKE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY.  WE ARE ORDERING PLANES.   OTHER COUNTRIES ARE ORDERING  MODERN PLANES, BEAUTIFUL.   WE ARE PUTTING JUNK BACK ON OUR   PLANES AND PUTTING OUR PILOTS ON  THERE AND STRIPPING OTHER PLANES  ON THE RUNWAY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GET THE PLANES TO  WORK. THEY ARE USING, ESSENTIALLY, 60% OF FUNDING.   IS THIS THE UNITED STATES?  IS THIS OUR COUNTRY?  OBAMA DOES NOT CARE.  HE CANNOT CARE. SO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS OUR MILITARY IS BEING DEPLETED AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED OUR  MILITARY PROBABLY MORE THAN EVER  BEFORE, RIGHT? WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A MILITARY THAT IS GOING TO BE SO BIG, SO STRONG, SO POWERFUL, THAT NOBODY IS GOING TO MESS WITH US.   AS PART OF THAT, AND TO ME, VERY  IMPORTANT, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS.   OUR VETS ARE BEING TREATED BADLY.  WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE  OBAMACARE.  OBAMACARE IS A DISASTER.  WE ARE GOING TO TERMINATE COMMON  CORE AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE   LOCAL EDUCATION FOR YOUR  CHILDREN.   WE ARE GOING TO PRESERVE THE  SECOND AMENDMENT, WHICH IS UNDER  SIEGE. AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA FIRST -- THERE IS AN  EXPRESSION. WE DO NOT MAKE AMERICA FIRST.  THESE NEGOTIATORS, FIRST OF ALL,  THEY ARE POLITICAL HACKS. THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE THE JOB.  WE HAVE THE GREATEST BUSINESS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.  WE ARE GOING TO USE THE GREATEST  BUSINESS MINDS WHEN WE NEGOTIATE  WITH CHINA AND ALL THESE  COUNTRIES THAT RIP US OFF.  WE ARE GOING TO USE THE GREATEST  BUSINESS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.  YOU WILL SEE A DIFFERENCE LIKE  YOU HAVE NOT SEEN BEFORE. WHEN WE DEFEND THESE COUNTRIES AND NATO, I AM ALL FOR NATO, BUT  A LOT OF THESE COUNTRIES ARE NOT  PAYING US.  THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PAYING US. IN THE OLD DAYS, WHEN I USED TO  COLLECT RENT IN BROOKLYN, THE WORD IS ""DELINQUENT."" THEY ALL WAS A LOT OF RENT. THEY OWE US MONEY. THEY ARE DELINQUENT. WE ARE DEFENDING THEM, AND THEY ARE PAYING A FRACTION OF WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PAYING. DO YOU KNOW THE KIND OF MONEY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT? NOW, WE DEFEND JAPAN. MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.  WE DEFEND JAPAN. WE DEFEND GERMANY.  WE DEFEND SAUDI ARABIA.  SAUDI ARABIA, BEFORE THE OIL ----   DO NOT WORRY ABOUT IT. THEY ARE MAKING A LOT.  THEY WERE MAKING $1 BILLION A DAY.  WOULD YOU LIKE THAT FOR NEW  JERSEY, CHRIS? $1 BILLION A DAY?   WE GET PRACTICALLY NOTHING, FOLKS.  AND THEY WOULD NOT BE THERE.  AND I HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS THAT  ARE SAUDIS THAT BUY MY  APARTMENTS, YOU WOULD NOT  BELIEVE IT.  THEY ARE ALL GREAT.  WE CANNOT BE FOOLED ANY LONGER,  WE CANNOT BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF  ANY LONGER. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY RICH AGAIN AND STRONG AGAIN.  WE WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD SOCIAL  SECURITY AND MEDICARE AGAIN.  I AM THE ONLY ONE THAT SAYS THAT.  WE WILL NOT BE LED DOWN THE  TUBES BY AN INCOMPETENT PERSON  LIKE HILLARY CLINTON.  BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT WHAT SHE HAS  DONE, HER DEAL WITH LIBYA.  JUST TAKE A LOOK AT LIBYA.  IT IS A CATASTROPHE. BY THE WAY, YOU HAVE BENGHAZI.  THINK OF WHAT -- THINK OF LIBYA.  THEY HAVE SOME OF THE FINEST OIL  IN THE WORLD.  YOU KNOW WHO HAS THE OIL?  ISIS HAS THE OIL. ISIS.  THIS WAS HER DEAL.  SO MANY OTHER MISTAKES, SO MANY AND OTHER MISTAKES. I HAVE A WHOLE LIST, BUT I AM  NOT GOING TO DO THAT, BECAUSE WE  ARE HAVING TOO MUCH FUN.  LET ME JUST TELL YOU FOLKS, I  HAVE GONE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. I HAVE SEEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. WE HAVE THE BIGGEST CROWDS BY FAR, FAR BIGGER THAN BERNIE. HE IS SECOND. I THINK WHAT HAPPENS, I BELIEVE  THAT HIS PEOPLE, A LARGE  PERCENTAGE OF HIS PEOPLE, VOTE  FOR TRUMP.  YOU WATCH, YOU WATCH WHAT IS  GOING TO HAPPEN.  THE ONE THING HE IS RIGHT ON IS  TRADE.  HE HAS GOT THAT RIGHT, EXCEPT HE  CANNOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  THE DIFFERENCE IS, I AM GOING TO  MAKE A GREAT DEAL AS OPPOSED TO  SAYING, WE ARE JUST GETTING  RIPPED OFF.  THAT IS ALL HE CAN DO.

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residential Candidate Donald Trump Rally in Charleston, West Virginia"

I WANT TO START AS ALWAYS THINKING MY FAMILY, MY WIFE, MY KIDS. THEY ARE NOT KIDS ANYMORE BUT THEY ARE ALWAYS MY KIDS. I WANT TO THANK MY GREAT PARENTS WHO ARE LOOKING DOWN RIGHT NOW ON US. I WANT TO THANK MY ENTIRE FAMILY INCLUDING MARION ELIZABETH ROBERT. IT HAS BEEN SOME UNBELIEVABLE DAY, EVENING AND YEAR. I HAVE NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL THING TO BEHOLD. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  IT IS SO IMPORTANT, THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE. I STARTED NOT LONG AGO ABOUT SIX WEEKS AGO. I WAS TOLD I HAD A 20 POINT DEFICIT. I WENT AND WORKED VERY HARD AND CAMPAIGNS. I MADE LOTS OF SPEECHES AND THE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. YOU DON'T GET BETTER. THE CROWDS. BIGGER AND BETTER. IT WAS LIKE I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE. MAYBE I WILL JUST NEVER LEAVE. WE HAD A TREMENDOUS VICTORY TONIGHT. BOBBY KNIGHT WAS INCREDIBLE.   I ALWAYS SAY PEOPLE LIKE THAT, THERE ARE NOT MANY. IT IS CALLED TOUGH, SMART AND THEY KNOW HOW TO WIN. THAT IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS PEEWEE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO WIN. WE HAVE BEEN LOSING ALL THE TIME. WE LOSE WITH OUR MILITARY. WE CAN'T BEAT ISIS. WE LOSE WITH TRADE. WE LOSE WITH BORDERS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LOSE. WE'RE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN.  WHEN I GOT BACK TONIGHT AND STARTED WATCHING ALL OF THE DIFFERENT NETWORKS I COULD SEE IMMEDIATELY WE WERE DOING WELL. IT LOOKS LIKE A MASSIVE VICTORY, LIKE WE WIN ALL 57 DELEGATES.  AND, I MUST SAY, IN STAYING IN VARIOUS PLACES IN INDIANA WE HAD , I TURN ON THE TELEVISION AND ALL ISIL WERE NEGATIVE ADS. I CALLED MY PEOPLE AND SAID HOW CAN WE WIN, IT IS JUST CONSTANTLY? THERE HAVE BEEN 60,000 NEGATIVE ADS. 60,000. TWO WEEKS AGO IT WAS 55,000. NOW IT IS 60,000 NEGATIVE ADS. MOST OF WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY FALSE AND DISGUSTING. I SAID HOW CAN ANYBODY ENDURE THIS? I HAD ONE EVENING WHERE WE HAD FIVE ADS ON IN BETWEEN SEGMENTS OF THE SHOW I WAS WATCHING. I SAID THAT IS INCREDIBLE. THE PEOPLE ARE SO SMART, THEY DON'T BUY IT. THEY GET IT. TREMENDOUS.  TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY WERE SPENT. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IT WAS PROBABLY $8 MILLION SPENT AGAINST ME. WE SPENT $900,000. THAT IS THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE. SOMETHING THAT MAKES ME FEEL REALLY VERY GOOD. NOW WE ARE GOING TO NEBRASKA WHERE WE ARE DOING WONDERFULLY. I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT VERY MUCH. WE ARE GOING TO GET THE MINERS BACK TO WORK. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE HILLARY CLINTON. I WATCHED HER WHEN SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE MINERS AS IF THEY WERE JUST NUMBERS. SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT SHE WANTS THE MINES CLOSED. THE MINERS IN WEST VIRGINIA AND PENNSYLVANIA, OHIO, ALL OVER, THEY ARE GOING TO START TO WORK AGAIN. YOU'RE GOING TO BE PROUD TO BE MINERS.  WE WILL BE GOING THERE. I MUST SAY, THIS TREMENDOUS RUN WE HAVE, 62%, THAT'S WITH THREE PEOPLE. A MASSIVE LANDSLIDE. 63% TO LITTER OVER 62. WHEN YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF NUMBER WITH THREE PEOPLE IT IS ACTUALLY UNHEARD OF. ALL THROUGHOUT IT WAS 17 PEOPLE, 15, 12. IT'S TREMENDOUS. WE WERE GETTING HIGH NUMBERS. SOME OF THE NUMBERS IN THE EARLY STAGES WERE A STATE WITH 32% BUT 14 PEOPLE. THAT MAY BE ACTUALLY MORE AND BETTER THAN GETTING 62% IN NEW YORK. BUT WE NEVER GOT CREDIT FOR THAT . WE DON'T NEED THE CREDIT. HILLARY, SHE WILL NOT --   SHE WILL NOT BE A GREAT PRESIDENT. SHE WILL NOT BE A GOOD PRESIDENT. SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND TRADE. HER HUSBAND SIGNED PERHAPS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD THE WORST TRADE DEAL EVER DONE. IT IS CALLED NAFTA. I WAS WITNESS TO THE CARNAGE OVER THE LAST SIX WEEKS ESPECIALLY. I'VE KNOWN SYRACUSE AND POUGHKEEPSIE, ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PLACES I VISITED IN NEW YORK AND PENNSYLVANIA. AND MARYLAND. THE PEOPLE ARE INCREDIBLE. ALL OF THE DIFFERENT STATES. I'VE WITNESSED WHAT IT HAS DONE FIRSTHAND. WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE IT AROUND. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THESE COMPANIES THINK THEY CAN GO TO ANOTHER COUNTRY, SELL THEIR PRODUCTS BACK TO US AND WE ONLY GET UNEMPLOYMENT. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.  WE ARE GOING TO BRING BACK OUR JOBS AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP OUR JOBS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET COMPANIES LEAVE. THEY WANT TO GO TO A DIFFERENT STATE, GOOD LUCK. WHEN THEY GO TO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, COUNTRIES THAT DEVALUE THEIR CURRENCY AND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR COMPANIES TO COMPETE, THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. IF THEY WANT TO DO IT ANYWAY, THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES.  I HAVE TO TELL YOU I HAVE COMPETED ALL MY LIFE. ALL MY LIFE I HAVE BEEN IN COMPETITIONS. DIFFERENT COMPETITIONS. WHETHER IT IS SPORTS, OR BUSINESS, OR NOW, POLITICS. I HAVE MET SOME OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE COMPETITORS I'VE EVER COMPETED AGAINST. TED CRUZ, I DON'T KNOW IF HE LIKES ME OR DOES IT. HE IS ONE HELL OF A COMPETITOR. HE IS A TOUGH, SMART GUY.  AND HE HAS GOT AN AMAZING FUTURE. HE HAS GOT AN AMAZING FUTURE. I WANT TO CONGRATULATE TED. I KNOW HOW TOUGH IT IS. IT IS TOUGH. I'VE HAD MOMENTS WHERE IT WAS NOT LOOKING SO GOOD. IT IS NOT A GREAT FEELING. I UNDERSTAND HOW TED CRUZ, AND HEIDI, AND THEIR BEAUTIFUL FAMILY AREA -- FAMILY. ONE TOUGH COMPETITOR. I CAN SAY THAT FOR THE OTHERS. CHRIS CHRISTIE, WHO ENDORSED ME, INCREDIBLE GOD. DR. BEN CARSON WHO WAS RIGHT UP THERE, ONE OF THE FIRST. HE CALLED ME AND SAID IT'S A MOVEMENT, IT'S AN INCREDIBLE MOVEMENT. DR. BEN CARSON ENDORSED ME. THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE MAN. WE WANT TO KEEP THEM INVOLVED. BECAUSE WE GOING TO WIN IN NOVEMBER.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN BIG. IT'S GOING TO BE AMERICA FIRST. THEY DON'T RESPECT US PRAY THEY DON'T TAKE TAKE CARE OF US. -- THEY DON'T RESPECT US. THEY DON'T TAKE CARE OF US. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THINGS GOING VERY CLOSELY. WITH THE BUDGET RECENTLY DONE IT WITH $21 TRILLION. WE ARE NOT IN THE POSITION WE WERE IN 30 YEARS AGO, 40 YEARS AGO WITH A LOT OF THESE THINGS BEGAN TAKING PLACE. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE UNBELIEVABLY GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. LIKEWISE, THEY HAVE TO TREAT US FAIRLY AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING OVER THE YEARS HAS BEEN SO WRONG AND SO UNFAIR TO THE UNITED STATES AND TO ITS PEOPLE, AND TO ITS TAXPAYERS. THAT WILL CHANGE. THEY ARE GOING TO END UP LIKING US BETTER THAN THEY DO RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE GOING TO RESPECT US. IN THIS BUILDING, RIGHT UPSTAIRS.  I HAVE THE LARGEST BANK IN THE WORLD FROM CHINA. THE RELATIONSHIP WAS FANTASTIC. WE HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES. BUT THEY HAVE TO RESPECT US AND UNDERSTAND WHERE WE ARE COMING FROM. IT IS A TWO-WAY STREET. THE TWO-WAY STREET MEANS WE ARE GOING DOWN ONE SIDE AND THEY ARE COMING UP THE OTHER. WE ARE GOING TO MEET AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE FABULOUS. IF THAT CAN'T HAPPEN, IF FOR SOME REASON THEY WANT THE SYSTEM TO CONTINUE THE WAY IT IS GOING NOW, WHICH IS UNFAIR AND NOT GOOD, WHERE WE ARE'S BILLION -- SPENDING TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND WE HAVE TO REBUILD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, OUR ROADS, OUR BRIDGES CAN OUR AIRPORTS AND HOSPITALS, WE HAVE BECOME CLOSE TO A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY. YOU SEE PLACES LIKE IT HAS NEVER SEEN. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD THAT OUR MILITARY BIGGER, BETTER, STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. IT'S THE CHEAPEST THING WE CAN DO. WE HAVE TO TAKE OUT ISIS FAST. WE CAN'T ALLOW THAT CANCER TO CONTINUE. WE CANNOT ALLOW IT. YOU KNOW THE ONE GROUP HAS BEEN SO INCREDIBLE TO ME. THE VETERANS. THEY HAVE BEEN TREATED SO BADLY. WE GOING TO GET THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT JUST HAPPENED, WHICH IS VERY EXCITING , THE POPE CAME OUT YESTERDAY AND I AM NOW LEADING HILLARY CLINTON. A LOT OF GREAT THINGS.    THAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE GREAT TRADE DEALS. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO WITH THE MILITARY AND THE BORDER, INCLUDING THE WALL. WE WILL HAVE UNBELIEVABLY GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE HISPANICS, WHO HAVE BEEN SO INCREDIBLE TO ME. THEY WANT JOBS. EVERYBODY WANTS JOBS. AFRICAN-AMERICANS WANT JOBS. THEY WANT JOBS. WERE GOING TO BRING BACK OUR JOBS AND SAVE OUR JOBS PRINT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE GREAT JOBS AGAIN. THIS COUNTRY, WHICH IS VERY DIVIDED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS IS GOING TO BECOME ONE BEAUTIFUL, LOVING COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO LOVE EACH OTHER, CHAIR IS EACH OTHER, TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER, AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE GREAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET OTHER COUNTRIES TAKE IT AWAY FROM US. THAT IS WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR FAR TOO MANY YEARS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT ANYMORE.  I WANT TO THANK AND CONGRATULATE THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE, AND REINCE PRIEBUS. IT IS NOT AN EASY JOB. I GUESS HE IS DOWN TO ONE. IS THERE A SECOND?  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU FOLKS TO EXPLAIN THE STATUS OF THAT. HE'S DONE AN AMAZING JOB. WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOMETHING REALLY FANTASTIC. I WANT TO THANK MY STAFF, PAUL, COREY, HOPE. THESE PEOPLE. WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IS INCREDIBLE.    THE WORK HAS BEEN UNREAL. AND JARED, MARRIED TO MY DAUGHTER. HONESTLY, JARED IS A VERY SUCCESSFUL REAL ESTATE PERSON COME UP BUT I ACTUALLY THINK HE LIKES POLITICS MORE THAN HE LIKES REAL ESTATE. AND HE IS VERY GOOD AT POLITICS. AGAIN, THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING EVENING, I DID NOT EXPECT THIS, I DID NOT EXPECT IT HERE AT. WHAT TED DID IS A GREAT THING TO DO, BECAUSE WE WANT TO BRING UNITY TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WE HAVE TO BRING UNITY. THIS SO MUCH EASIER IF WE HAVE IT.  MANY, MANY PEOPLE ARE CALLING THAT HE WOULD NOT EVEN BELIEVE IT THE MEDIA, THE PRESS, THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE. PEOPLE THAT HAVE SET THE WORST THINGS ABOUT ME, I'VE NEVER HAD THINGS SAID ABOUT ME LIKE THIS. IN MY BUSINESSES I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A VERY RESPECTED. BUT POLITICS IT IS EASY. THE WORST THINGS, AND THEY ARE CALLING NOW, CALLING US ALL AND SAYING WE WOULD LOVE TO GET ON THE TRUMP TRAIN, THE TEAM.   AND I ACTUALLY SPOKE TO ONE TODAY WHO WAS VICIOUS. THIS GUY WAS UNBELIEVABLE. I SAID, I LOVE HAVING YOU AND I THINK IT IS TERRIFIC, BUT AFTER WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT ME, HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY JOIN OUR TEAM? AND HE SAID, MR. TRUMP, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, THERE WILL BE NO PROBLEM. IN OTHER WORDS, HE IS A POLITICIAN. I WOULD HAVE HAD A HARD TIME. WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING, LOTS OF CONGRESSMAN. I HAVE TO THANK SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS, ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED MEN OR PEOPLE IN CONGRESS.   AND SO MANY OTHERS, SERA PALIN HAS BEEN FROM DAY ONE, INCREDIBLE. JERRY FALWELL JUNIOR, LIBERTY UNIVERSITY, HE IS SOMETHING, HE IS REALLY A SPECIAL PERSON AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. WE ALL GO THROUGH LIBERTY, AND SOMEHOW HE LIKE WHAT I WAS SAYING AND HOW I SAID IT, AND HE IS A SPECIAL GUY. SO MANY PASTORS AND MINISTERS. TONIGHT I SEE I ONE WITH THE EVANGELICALS, THE EVANGELICAL VOTE WAS FOR TRUMP.   AND THERE IS NO GREATER HONOR, JUST NO GREATER HONOR. WE WILL WORK TOGETHER FOR MANY YEARS, WE WILL MAKE IT SO GOOD. WE WILL BE SAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN.   I WON WITH WOMEN. I LOVE WINNING WITH WOMEN.   I WON WITH WOMEN, I WON WITH MEN, I WON WITH HISPANICS, I WON WITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS, WE WON WITH VIRTUALLY EVERY CATEGORY. IT HAS JUST BEEN AN AMAZING EVENING. AGAIN, I WANT TO CONGRATULATE TED CRUZ. HE IS A TOUGH, SMART COMPETITOR. I WANT TO THANK MY WIFE AND MY FAMILY, IT IS AN INCREDIBLE FAMILY HERE IN -- INCREDIBLE FAMILY. I WANT TO THANK MY STAFF, I THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION.   AND PERHAPS IN ALL FAIRNESS, MORE IMPORTANTLY, MY STAFF WHEN WE ARE RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY. AND REMEMBER THIS, OUR THEME IS VERY SIMPLE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE WILL START WINNING AGAIN. YOU WILL BE SO PROUD OF THIS COUNTRY, VERY, VERY SOON. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH, THANK YOU. ",Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Indiana Primary Night Speech

WHITES, REDS, EVERYTHING. BUT WE LOVE. YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH IS, AT THE TRUMP RALLIES IT IS THE SAFEST PLACE YOU CAN BE. BECAUSE WE LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER. AND WE LOOK OUT FOR EVERYBODY. WE HAD ONE IN COSTA MESA RECENTLY. WE HAD ONE IN CALIFORNIA RECENTLY. 31,000 PEOPLE. UNBELIEVABLE. YOU DON'T READ ABOUT THAT. YOU READ ABOUT, THEY HAD SOME PROBLEMS OUTSIDE. PEOPLE WERE BURNING THE AMERICAN FLAG. I DON'T WANT THEM BURNING THE AMERICAN FLAG. NOT THE PEOPLE INSIDE, THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE. THEY ARE AGITATORS. MANY ARE PROFESSIONALS. THEY ARE BAD PEOPLE. YOU DON'T SEE IT AT ALL. NO, LOOK AT THIS PLACE. YOU DON'T SEE IT. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH DAYS, IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. CALIFORNIA WAS UNBELIEVABLE. A NEW POLL JUST CAME OUT IN CALIFORNIA WHERE I AM LEADING 55 TO LIKE 20. OK?   BUT I DO LOVE THAT CLINTON POLL. THE OTHER ONE HAD ME TIED UP. BY THE WAY, HILLARY CLINTON, IN A STATE CALLED INDIANA, WHICH WE LOVE, THAT JUST CAME OUT, TOO. THAT IS THE WALL STREET JOURNAL NBC POLL. TRUMP IS LEADING HILLARY 48-41. AND THE ONLY THING TED CRUZ COULD SAY WITH HIS SHAKESPEAREAN EVERYTHING, OH. I CANNOT WATCH. I LOVE THESE GUYS. THEY ARE ONLINE. DID YOU SEE THEM A OVER THE NEWS? WE WANT TRUMP. LYING TED. THAT'S RIGHT. HE LIES LIKE NOBODY ELSE CAN LIE. THEY WERE ONLINE AND THE HAD -- THEY HAD THESE GUYS DEBATING AND THEY KNOW THEY GET IT. , THEY SAID, YOU ARE LYING. YOU ARE LYING. SOMEONE SAID ONLINE THEY WERE SUPPORTING TRUMP. THEN ALL THE SUDDEN I HEARD I WAS SUPPORTING WITH HIM AS MY VICE PRESIDENT. AND YOU HAD TED CRUZ SAYING, WHO WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE, HIMSELF AND CARLY OR DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE TYSON. WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? I SAID, WHERE DID THAT COME? FIRST OF ALL, I'M HONORED THAT HE ENDORSED ME BUT WHERE DID , THAT COME FROM? AND THEN HE SAID, DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO RAISE YOUR TAXES 40 -- 40%. JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND, I HAVE A TAX POLICY AND WE HAVE A TAX LAND PUT IN AND I AM GIVEN BY -- GIVING MY FAR THE BIGGEST TAX REDUCTION OF ANYBODY RUNNING. BY FAR. ESPECIALLY FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND ESPECIALLY FOR BUSINESS. WITH THE HIGHEST TAXED NATION IN -- WE ARE THE HIGHEST TAXED NATION IN THE WORLD. THE FACT IS THE ONE CRITICISM OF MY TAX PLAN IS THAT I AM GIVING SO MUCH. IN OTHER WORDS, MY TAX PLAN IS MUCH HIGHER. YET YOU LISTEN TO THIS LYING GUY WHO SAYS I WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES 40%. THESE POLITICIANS ARE REALLY BAD. I HAVE ONLY DONE THIS NINE MONTHS. I THINK I AM DOING A GOOD JOB. DO YOU AGREE? [CHEERS AND  AND ALL MY LIFE I HAVE THE BUSINESS STARTED OFF WITH A $1 MILLION LOAN AND THEN I BUILT A NET WORTH OVER $10 BILLION WITH THE GREATEST ASSETS. VERY LOW DEBT. TREMENDOUS CASH FLOW. AND I ONLY SAY IT FOR ONE REASON BECAUSE I DON'T CARE. I AM JUST SAYING, THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO BRING OUR COUNTRY BACK. WE HAVE TO BRING OUR COUNTRY BACK. WE NEED TO BRING OUR COUNTRY BACK. THE WORLD IS RIPPING US OFF. WHETHER IT BE CHINA OR VIETNAM OR JAPAN. I COULD NAME ANY COUNTRY. WE DO NOT WIN ANY MORE. WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING. BIG-LEAGUE. BIG-LEAGUE. SO I'M GIVING YOU THE BIGGEST AND I HEAR THIS GUY AND I THINK, OH I WISH I WERE STANDING NEXT TO HIM SO I CAN TELL THE TRUTH. NOW, YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING ME FOR A LONG TIME. REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE, RIGHT? SO LYING TED CRUZ GETS UP AND SAYS, DONALD TRUMP LOVES, YOU KNOW WITH A BIG FLARES. -- A BIG FLOURISH. YOU KNOW HONESTLY, I DO NOT EVEN THINK HE IS A GOOD DEBATER. ACCORDING TO EVERY SINGLE ONLINE POLL AT EVERY SINGLE ONLINE DEBATE, I HAVE BEATEN HIM. I MEAN, I DO NOT DEBATE HIM. MY WHOLE LIFE IS A DEBATE. BUT THIS GUY, SO I TALK ABOUT OBAMACARE. WE'RE GOING TO REPEAL IT AND REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING GREAT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN IT, BUT PREMIUMS ARE GOING UP SO MUCH, RIGHT? PREMIUMS ARE GOING UP 25%, 45%, 55%. YOUR DEDUCTIBLES ARE SO HIGH THAT YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE IT UNLESS YOU ARE LIKE CLOSE TO DEATH. EVERY SPEECH I SAY WE WILL REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE. SO I HEAR THIS GUY TODAY, LYING TED CRUZ. HE SAYS, DONALD TRUMP LOVES OBAMACARE. HE WANTS TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL. HE LOVES IT. I AM SAYING, HE IS SUCH A LIAR. YOU KNOW, I WAS GIVEN A LITTLE BIT OF SHELTER WHEN DURING ONE OF THE DEBATES, MARCO RUBIO CALLED HIM A LIAR. SO NOW HERE IS A SENATOR CALLING A SENATOR A LIAR. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A GUY LIE LIKE THAT. HE EVEN SAID, DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT BUILD A WALL. HE SAID HE IS NOT GOING TO BUILD THE WALL. NOT BUILD THE WALL? OK. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD THE WALL. CAN YOU IMAGINE? NO, NO, CAN YOU IMAGINE? WE ARE GOING TO BUILD THE WALL. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE WALL. AND I TELL YOU, WE ARE GOING TO BUILD THE WALL, WE ARE GOING TO STOP DRUGS FROM POURING IN AND POISONING OUR YOUTH AND OTHER PEOPLE. WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL. AND I'VE GOT THIS GUY, TED CRUZ. LYING TED. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO BUILD THE WALL. I THINK HE IS CRAZY. HONESTLY, I THINK HE IS CRAZY. LYING TED DOES NOT HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT TO BE DOING THIS. HE IS CHOKING LIKE A DOG BECAUSE HE IS LOSING SO BADLY, WE HAVE TO PUT HIM AWAY TOMORROW. FOLKS, WE HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE. WE HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE.   WE HAVE GOT TO GET OUT AND VOTE. SO -- THANK YOU, DARLING. I LOVE HER TOO. READY? SO THIS IS VERY DEPRESSING. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. EVERY PLACE I HAVE GONE TO, NEW YORK STATE LANDSLIDES. BUT I GO TO DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES AND I SAY TO MY STATISTICIANS, NOT THE MOST EXCITING JOB, BUT THEY LOVE IT. RIGHT? IT'S THEIR JOB BUT I SAY GIVE ME THE STATISTICS ON CERTAIN AREAS ALBANY NEW YORK, POUGHKEEPSIE. , I GO TO NEW YORK AND IT'S HORRIBLE. WHAT'S HAPPENING? THE JOBS ARE DOWN 50% IN MANUFACTURING, IT'S HORRIBLE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN NEW YORK STATE. I GO TO PENNSYLVANIA. YOU LOOK AT THE STEEL INDUSTRY AND BY THE WAY LOOK AT THE STEEL INDUSTRY HERE, IT'S BEING KILLED. THE STEEL INDUSTRY HERE IS BEING KILLED. THE COAL INDUSTRY IS BEING KILLED. YOUR INDUSTRY, YOUR MANUFACTURING, SO I GO UP TO SELL THEN WILL STOP WHAT SCHOOL -- WHAT SCHOOL DO I LOVE? I HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS THAT LOVE ME THERE ARE THAT WOULD LIKE TO BE THERE WITH ME RIGHT NOW IN SOUTH BEND. FOR A CERTAIN REASON. READY? SO SOUTH BEND OF REASON. LISTEN TO THIS. AND DON'T BE DEPRESSED, BECAUSE WE GOING TO FIX IT. NO POLITICIAN CAN FIX IT BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL BOUGHT AND CONTROLLED BY SPECIAL INTERESTS. REMEMBER THAT. SO A FRIEND OF MINE WHO IS VERY SMART, A VERY SMART GUY, HE SAID TO ME, YOU KNOW DONALD I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THESE POLITICIANS ARE REALLY STUPID. I SAID THEY ARE NOT STUPID, THEY ARE GIVEN SO MANY MONEY -- SO MUCH MONEY BY SPECIAL INTEREST AND MANY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. SO THESE GUYS THAT NEGOTIATE WITH CHINA AND MEXICO AND ALL THESE BIG COUNTRIES WHERE WE JUST DIE WITH THESE HORRIBLE TRADE DEALS. SOME OF THEM ARE NOT GOOD. YOU KNOW, THEY ARE POLITICAL HACKS. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT. THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY STUPID. THEY ARE MAKING DEALS BECAUSE THEY ARE SPECIAL-INTEREST GROUPS, LOBBYIST'S, DONORS, TELL THEM. WHEN I SEE CARRIER AIR-CONDITIONING LEAVING INDIANA TO GO TO MEXICO, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT SINCE THEY FIRST HAD THAT SPEECH I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. I SAID I KNOW I'D BE IN INDIANA. THE COACH WAS GREAT TO ENDORSE ME AND WE HAVE HAD SO MANY GREAT ENDORSEMENTS. AND BOBBY KNIGHT JUST CALLED AND BOBBY KNIGHT IS GOING TO BE HERE TOMORROW ALL DAY AND I WILL TELL YOU BOBBY KNIGHT WAS SO COOL BECAUSE A YEAR AGO BEFORE IT WAS GOING TO RUN I ANNOUNCED NINE OR 10 MONTHS AGO ON JUNE 16, A BIG DAY. NOT EASY TO DO THIS. IT TAKES GUTS TO DO THIS STUFF, BELIEVE ME FOLKS. I SORT OF HAD A NICE LIFE. I HAD A NICE COMPANY AND A NICE FAMILY AND NOW I CALL BACK AND SAY WE'LL BE HOME IN FOUR DAYS BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, BOBBY KNIGHT CALLED ME AND HE HEARD I WAS THINKING ABOUT RUNNING. I HAD NEVER MET BOBBY KNIGHT. I KNEW BOBBY KNIGHT, WINNER, SMART AND TOUGH WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED IN OUR COUNTRY. AND BOBBY CALLED UP AND FIRST I HAD TO MAKE SURE IT WAS HIM. THEY CALL BACK AND THEY DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS BUT BOBBY CALLED UP AND HE SAID I HOPE YOU ARE GOING TO RUN. I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT COACH, THINKING ABOUT IT SERIOUSLY. IT'S A BIG COMMITMENT. WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I WATCH WHAT'S HAPPENING AND HE SAID DONALD YOU'VE GOT TO RUN. I SAID COACH I'LL TELL YOU WHAT DO ME A FAVOR, GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER, LET ME SEE WHAT I DO AND I WILL CALL YOU. WHAT HAPPENS A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER ANNOUNCED I'M RUNNING AND I COME DOWN AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TRADE AND TALKING UP THE BORDER AND ALL THESE THINGS THAT -- THESE THINGS WOULD HAVE NEVER EVEN BEEN BROUGHT UP IF I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THEM. WHEN I TALK ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND WAS LIKE FOR WEEKS I WAS GETTING ABSOLUTELY KILLED BY THE PRESS AND THE DISHONEST MEDIA, BUT THE MEDIA THAT SAID WE HAVE 1500 PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT AND WE HAVE 6000. SO DISHONEST. CARL, DON'T BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? I HAD TO DO IT. WE TALKED ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND WE BROUGHT UP TRADE AND THEN YOU HAD PARIS AND I STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE MUSLIM PROBLEM WHICH IS A PROBLEM WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR YOU DON'T AND NOBODY ELSE IS TALKING ABOUT IT. WE TALKED ABOUT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM AND WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT DOESN'T WANT TO USE THE TERM BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL HE IS DOING OR MAYBE HE DOES KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING, ONE OR THE OTHER. MAYBE HE DOES KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING BUT IN SO MANY WAYS HE DOESN'T. BOBBY CALLED AND I PUT IN THIS NUMBER AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN INDIANA, BECAUSE USUALLY IT IS LATE, BUT NOW INDIANA IS BECOMING VERY IMPORTANT. AND I SAY IT'S SO IMPORTANT. IN TERMS OF THE RACE. USUALLY BY THIS TIME IT'S OVER AND IT DOESN'T MATTER BUT THIS TIME YOU FOLKS BELONG WHERE YOU BELONG. IT IS CALLED IMPORTANTVILLE. I HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS HERE. WE HAVE A HUGE VICTORY IN NEW YORK. CRUZ GOT ALMOST NO VOTES IN NEW YORK. HE WOULD BE BEATEN SO BADLY BY HILLARY CLINTON. HE CAN'T WIN SO THESE GUYS DO TERRIBLY AND THEN THE FOLLOWING WEEK I GET RID OF ALL FIVE IN A LANDSLIDE. WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE WHOLE THING. WE'RE GOING TO BEAT HER IN A LANDSLIDE.   ALL RIGHT? WE ARE GOING TO BEAT HER. SO, ONE OF MY POLITICAL GUYS SAID YOU KNOW WE ARE GOING TO INDIANA AND I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME OVER THERE IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS. AND THEY SAID, WE ARE GOING TO INDIANA. I MEAN, IF YOU COULD GET BOBBY KNIGHT, WOULD THAT BE POSSIBLE? I SAID, POSSIBLE? I HAVE HIS PHONE NUMBER ON MY DESK. I SAID WHAT A GREAT IDEA SO I CALLED THEM UP AND HERE IS HOW SMART HE IS. HE GOES I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOUR CALL. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? THEN HE SAID WHEN CAN WE MEET? HE'S BEEN SO INCREDIBLE AND HE SAID SOME THINGS THAT WERE REALLY TRUE. HE SAID, FOR THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA, DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE SUCH A GREAT PRESIDENT. AND I AM. I'M GOING TO WORK SO HARD FOR YOU TO BE GREAT. WE ARE GOING TO BRING JOBS BACK. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET CARRIER GO TO MEXICO. THERE'VE GOT TO BE CONSEQUENCES. WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO LAY OFF 1400 PEOPLE GO TO MEXICO AND SELL , THEIR PRODUCT BACK TO US WITH NO TAX OR CONSEQUENCE IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AND THAT'S NOT ONLY CARRIER. THAT IS MANY OTHERS. BECAUSE WE ARE LOSING OUR MANUFACTURERS. WE ARE LOSING OUR COUNTRY BETWEEN WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE, WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH CHINA, TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA. $500 BILLION $58 BILLION WITH MEXICO, A TRADE DEFICIT A TREMENDOUS TRADE DEFICIT, ASTRONOMICAL TRADE DEFICIT WITH JAPAN. EVERYBODY. WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT WITH EVERYBODY. YOU COULD CALL OUT A COUNTRY. AND NOW THEY WANT TO MAKE A NEW DEAL, TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP, WHICH WILL BE AS BAD AS NAFTA. OR WORSE. AND NAFTA WAS TERRIBLE. AND WHO APPROVED NAFTA? KASICH APPROVED NAFTA. KASICH APPROVED NAFTA WHEN HE WAS A CONGRESSMAN. ONE OF THE DECIDING VOTES. SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. WHEN BOBBY WENT INTO THAT ARENA, AND IT WAS A BIG ARENA, IT WAS INCREDIBLE. PEOPLE ARE SCREAMING, CRYING. THEY LOVE BOBBY. HEY LOOK, HE WON 900 GAMES. HE WON THREE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS. COLLEGE CHAMPIONSHIPS. HE WON THE OLYMPICS. HE WON THE PAN AM GAMES. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF YOU REALIZE THIS, I SAID HOW COME IT HAS NOT BEEN BROKEN YET? HE HAS THE LAST UNDEFEATED SEASON. HE ALMOST HAD IN A ROW, HE HAD TWO WON ALMOST BEFORE. I MEAN, THERE IS A GUY THAT IS A WINNER. HE SAID, FOR THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA IT IS AN IMPORTANT WEEK. IF WE WIN, IT IS OVER AND THEN I CAN FOCUS --   THEN I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LYING TED CRUZ. I DON'T CARE IF HE ENDORSES ME, I COULD CARE LESS. I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT JOHN KASICH, WHO IS ONE IN 44. AND THAT IS BECAUSE I DID NOT GO THAT I DON'T TWO DAYS, I STAYED -- THAT FINAL TWO DAYS, I STAYED IN FLORIDA BECAUSE I WANTED TO WIN FLORIDA AND THEY GAVE ME WHAT IS CALLED A DIRTY POLL. SOMEBODY CAME OUT WITH A DIRTY POLL IN FLORIDA. IF I WOULD'VE SPENT TWO MORE DAYS IN OHIO, WE WOULD HAVE WON. BUT I DID NOT STOP IT IS OK. BUT HE IS ONE FOR 44, 45, 46. SOMETHING. NOW, IN THE POPULAR VOTE I AM MILLIONS AHEAD OF TED CRUZ. BUT IT IS A RIGGED SYSTEM. THIS DELEGATE STUFF IT IS , DISHONEST. IT IS MEANT FOR THE BOSSES TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE SPECIAL INTERESTS HAPPY AND THE PEOPLE WHO GIVE THEM MONEY SAID THAT -- SO THAT MEXICO AND OTHER PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE BIG INTERESTS, I TELL YOU WHAT, THE SYSTEM IS SO SICK. IN LOUISIANA, I WIN LOUISIANA. I WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO. I WENT THERE AND CAMPAIGNED FOR THREE DAYS, MASSIVE SPEECHES. WE HAD AN AIRPLANE HANGAR BIGGER THAN THIS ROOM THAT WAS PACKED AND WE WIN LOUISIANA. AND THEN TWO OR THREE WEEKS LATER, THEY ARE GOING OVER THE NUMBERS. AND I GOT LIKE HARDLY ANY DELEGATES. IT'S ONLY BEEN NINE MONTHS. I AM FIGURING IT OUT FAST. YOU MEAN I CAN WIN AND THE GUY WHO COMES IN THIRD PLACE OR FOUR PLACE ENDS UP WITH MORE DELEGATES THAN ME. NO, THINK OF IT. IT'S A DIRTY SYSTEM. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I'M PROUD OF. FOR 40 OR 50 YEARS HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON ON WITH THIS CRAZY DELEGATE SYSTEM? NOBODY HAS EVER COMPLAINED. NOBODY EVER TALKS ABOUT IT. I ALWAYS HEARD, DELEGATE, DELEGATE. THEN YOU HAD IN COLORADO WHERE THEY DID A POLL AND THEY SAID WE DON'T WANT TO GO AND VOTE SO LET'S TAKE THE VOTES AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE AND LET THE BOSSES ARE IS GOING TO PICK IT. AND THE BOSSES ARE ALWAYS GOING TO PICK A SENATOR WHO IS UNDER CONTROL WHO TAKES ALL THESE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND BORROWS MONEY FROM GOLDMAN SACHS. CRUZ BORROWED MONEY FROM GOLDMAN SACHS AND CITIBANK. $1 MILLION AT A RATE YOU WOULD BE PROUD TO HAVE. NOBODY IN THIS ROOM WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THE LOAN RATE AND HE FORGOT TO DISCLOSE IT ON HIS FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORM. HE FORGOT, LYIN' TED. HE SAID, I FORGOT. HE WAS UNTIL 18 MONTHS AGO HE WAS A CITIZEN OF CANADA. HE FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT. OH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. OH. THIS GUY, I MEAN GIVE ME A BREAK. BOBBY SAID, AND IT WAS SO INCREDIBLE. BOBBY KNIGHT SAID TO THE PEOPLE AT ONE OF THE SPEECHES BECAUSE HE WENT AROUND WITH ME, HE SAID IT WILL BE SO GREAT BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE A GREAT PRESIDENT AND I APPRECIATE HIM SAYING THAT. AND THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA IF THEY VOTE FOR HIM THEY ARE GOING TO PUT HIM OVER THE TOP AND WE CAN FOCUS ON HILLARY CLINTON. SO GOOD.   NOBODY COULD SAY IT, NOBODY COULD SAY IT. SO I APPRECIATE LOU HOLTZ JUST CALLED IN AND JUST ENDORSED ME.   A REALLY GOOD GUY, JUST PUT IT OUT. IT'S ALL OVER THE INTERNET. LOU HOLTZ IS A REALLY GOOD GUY SO WE HAVE EVERYBODY. I MEAN, WE HAVE SO MANY GREAT ENDORSEMENTS. YOU KNOW WHO'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME? 16,500 BORDER PATROL PEOPLE ENDORSED ME LAST WEEK. THEY HAVE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE. AND OF COURSE, SHERIFF JOE, YOU TALK ABOUT BORDERS, SHERIFF JOE FROM ARIZONA, BUT THE 60,500 -- 16,500 PEOPLE HAD NEVER ENDORSED A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BEFORE AND THEY ENDORSED ME SO THAT WAS A GREAT HONOR. BECAUSE WE NEED BORDERS. WE NEED TO HAVE OUR COUNTRY BACK. WE CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE WALKING ACROSS OUR BORDERS AND WE HAVE TO EITHER HAVE A COUNTRY OR WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY AND YOU CAN'T HAVE A COUNTRY IF YOU DON'T HAVE BORDERS AND ON TOP OF THAT WE HAVE DRUGS POURING ACROSS. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WON NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT WAS THE FIRST STATE THAT I WON. AND WHEN YOU WIN SOMETHING, YOU GET A SPECIAL FEELING. I WON NEW HAMPSHIRE IN A LANDSLIDE. I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO. JEB BUSH WAS SUPPOSED TO. HE RAISED $168 MILLION IN A SUPER PAC. $168 MILLION. HE WAS FAVORED TO WIN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND I WON IN A LANDSLIDE. I HAVE A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF ENERGY. WHAT CAN I SAY? AND I WOULDN'T SAY THAT BECAUSE ONCE THE RACE IS OVER, I LOVE ALL THESE PEOPLE. WHEN YOU DEFEAT SOMEBODY, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO LOVE THEM. NEVER LOSE. AND I WOULDN'T SAY, THE OTHER DAY HE WAS ON TELEVISION SAYING BAD STUFF. ALTHOUGH HE DID SAY IT WAS A PHENOMENON. AND HE DID SAY, HE'S A GIFTED POLITICIAN. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. WHEN HE SAID I WAS A GIFTED POLITICIAN, I THINK HE SAID THAT AND IT WAS NOT MEANT AS A COMPLIMENT. BEING A POLITICIAN ITSELF IS NOT SO GREAT BUT I BEAT JEB BUSH AND THINK OF THIS, I SPENT THE LEAST AMOUNT OF MONEY. HE SPENT THE MOST. I CAME IN FIRST. HE CAME IN LAST OR CLOSE. OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SPENT FAR MORE MONEY THAN ME AND SO FAR I SPENT OF THE MAJOR CANDIDATES THE LEAST AMOUNT OF MONEY BY FAR AND I'M NUMBER ONE IN A LANDSLIDE. RIGHT?   NOW, IF YOU LOOK AT EDUCATION, 30 COUNTRIES, WE ARE LAST. WE ARE LIKE 30TH. WE ARE LAST. SO WE ARE LAST IN EDUCATION. IF YOU LOOK AT COST PER PUPIL, WE ARE FIRST. SO WE -- AND BY THE WAY THERE IS NO SECOND BECAUSE WE SPEND SO MUCH MORE PER PUPIL THAT THEY DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT NUMBER TWO. IT IS RIDICULOUS. SO, WOULDN'T YOU LIKE, I MEAN THINK OF THIS. AND BY THE WAY, IT'S NORWAY, DENMARK SWEDEN, CHINA, JAPAN. THE FIVE. WE ARE 30TH BUT WE ARE FIRST IN TERMS OF SPENDING PER PUPIL. NOW, AND THAT IS BAD. THAT IS BAD. THAT IS REAL BAD. NOW WITH ME I SPENT THE LEAST AND HAD THE BEST RESULTS. ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WANT FOR AND HERE'S THE OTHER THING, I'M SELF-FUNDING SO I'M NOT CONTROLLED BY ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT CONTROLLED CRUZ, THEY CONTROL HILLARY, CROOKED, CROOKED, CROOKED HILLARY. YOU KNOW THE OTHER DAY THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT CROOKED HILLARY AND MYSELF. RIGHT? AND THEY SAID ONE OF HER PEOPLE AND ONE OF OBAMA'S PEOPLE AND THEY SAID WHO DO YOU THINK HILLARY WANTS TO RUN AGAINST? AND THE GUY SAID, LET ME TELL YOU. THE ONE SHE DOESN'T WANT TO RUN AGAINST, DONALD TRUMP. SHE DOES NOT KNOW WHERE IT IS COMING. HE SAID, A GUY LIKE CRUZ IS COOKIE-CUTTER. IT WILL MAKE BARRY GOLDWATER LOOKS LIKE HE HAS A SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN. WITH TRUMP THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS GOING TO COME FROM AND I'M GOING TO WIN STATES LIKE NEW YORK, GOOD CHANCE. A STATE WHICH NO REPUBLICAN WOULD EVER EVEN CAMPAIGN BECAUSE HE HAD NO CHANCE. YOU SAW IT TWO WEEKS AGO I WON BY A LANDSLIDE. AGAINST TWO PEOPLE AND THE DISHONEST MEDIA WHEN THEY SAY LIKE ABOUT, FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS AGO, OR 10 WEEKS AGO, WE WOULD HAVE 12 PEOPLE AND I WOULD WANT TO STAY. I WON SOUTH CAROLINA, I WON NEVADA, I WON THE SOUTH. ALABAMA, KENTUCKY, I WON THEM ALL. I WON MISSOURI. I WON THEM ALL AND THEN I WON FLORIDA IN A LANDSLIDE AND THEY ARE SAYING, YOU DID NOT HAVE 50%. I HAVE 12 PEOPLE AGAINST ME. YOU CANNOT WIN 50%. I MEAN, IF I AM ABRAHAM LINCOLN I CAN GET IT THE PERCENT. 17 PEOPLE. IT IS THE BIGGEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE EVER TO RUN THAT ANYBODY CAN EVER REMEMBER, EVER. AND YET I WILL GET LIKE 36, 38, 42. AND I HAVE THESE CHARACTERS ON TELEVISION THAT DON'T HAVE THE BRAINS THEY WERE BORN WITH. OK? AND THEY ARE DISHONEST AND THEY ARE DISHONEST. OK? BUT THEY WILL SAY I HAVE THIS VICTORY WERE INDEED EVERYBODY BY A LOT TRADED 50%, 14 PEOPLE EVEN NOW I HAVE THREE PEOPLE SO WE HAVE THREE PEOPLE. IT'S HARD TO BREAK 50% WHEN YOU HAVE THREE PEOPLE AND YET IN NEW YORK, I GOT ALMOST 62%. RIGHT? IN PENNSYLVANIA -- IN PENNSYLVANIA, I WON EVERY SINGLE ONE. NOBODY REMEMBERS THAT HAPPENING BEFORE. IN DELAWARE THE SAME THING, IN MARYLAND IF EVERYONE EVERY ONE OF THEM. IN CONNECTICUT. I WON GREENWICH CONNECTICUT, NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN IT BEFORE. I WON THE RICH AREAS, I WON THE POOR AREAS. AND YOU HEAR, OR HAVE SHE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN MORE. ACTUALLY, THEY DID NOT SAY THAT. THEY ALWAYS SAY PHARMA THE ALWAYS SAY, WE HAD ALL THESE PEOPLE RUNNING AND THEY SAY, HE DID NOT GET 50%. AND JEB WOULD SAY, OH, HE IS NOT CONSERVATIVE. WE HAVE THE DUMMIES REPRESENTING US. THEY WOULD SAY I AM NOT CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE OF TRADE. IN TERMS OF TRADE, I BELIEVE IN FREE MARKET. BUT YOU CAN ONLY GO WITH FREE TRADE WHEN YOU HAVE SMART PEOPLE REPRESENTING YOU. BUT WE HAVE DUMMIES. WE HAVE THE DUMMIES REPRESENTING US. WE HAVE REAL DUMMIES. WE HAVE PEOPLE CONTROLLED BY SPECIAL INTERESTS SO WHEN YOU HAVE THAT YOU CAN THROW IN THE FREE TRADE OUT THE WINDOW. YOU SEE WHAT FREE TRADE HAS GOTTEN, YOU SEE WHAT GLOBALIZATION WOULD WE GO ALL OVER THE WORLD BECAUSE OUR POLITICIANS ARE CORRUPT AND CROOKED AND THEY ARE TOTALLY TAKEN CARE OF I -- BY CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND BY THE WAY WHO WOULD KNOW BETTER THAN ME? DO I KNOW THE SYSTEM BETTER THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD? OK? ANYBODY IN THE WORLD. SO WE HAVE A RIGGED DEAL AND HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT SAMARGYA -- THAT TOMORROW YOU GET OUT AND YOU VOTE. TOMORROW YOU HAVE GOT TO GET OUT AND VOTE. BECAUSE WE HAVE A MOVEMENT GOING ON. BILL O'REILLY FROM FOX IS A TOUGH COOKIE AND I ALWAYS SAY MAN, THAT WAS TOUGH. THESE INTERVIEWS WITH HIM. BUT I LIKE HIM. BILL O'REILLY SAYS IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE, HIS ENTIRE LIFE THIS IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST POLITICAL PHENOMENON HE HAS EVER WITNESSED. YOU, WHAT HAS HAPPENED? THE BIGGEST, THE BIGGEST. AND THEN I STAND HERE AND IS PACKED HALLS WITH THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND I HAVE TO LISTEN TO CARL CAMERON GIVES A PHONY COUNT, OK? BUT THINK OF IT. BILL O'REILLY SAYS THE SINGLE BIGGEST POLITICAL EVENT, I THINK THAT WAS THE WORD HE USED, EVENT. OF HIS LIFETIME. THAT'S A BIG STATEMENT. THAT'S A BIG STATEMENT. THAT'S A GUY WHO'S BEEN AROUND AND HE IS A SMART GUY BUT THAT'S A BIG STATEMENT. MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID IT TO US. BUT I AM A MESSENGER. IF YOU ARE TIRED OF MAKING LESS MONEY THAN HE DID 18 YEARS AGO, YOU ARE TIRED OF IT, I UNDERSTAND IT. I UNDERSTAND IT. YOU ARE TIRED OF SEEING CARRIER LEAVE YOUR STATE GO TO MEXICO, BUILD A PLANT, PUT THEIR EQUIPMENT AND SELL IT LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED AND BY THE WAY THE AIR-CONDITIONERS COST THE SAME BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO COMPETE WITH CRANE AND ALL THE OTHER COMPANIES. I BUY FROM ALL OF THEM. I AM NOT BUYING FROM CARRIER ANYMORE, BY THE WAY. I AM NOT BUYING. BUT THEY HAVE TO COMPETE WITH ALL THE OTHER COMPANIES. IT IS GOING TO BE THE SAME. THEY HAVE TO MAKE MORE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT DOES IT DO FOR US? SO I'M A FREE TRADER BUT FREE TRADE ISN'T WORKING AND WE DON'T HAVE THE PEOPLE THAT CAN DO FREE TRADE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE SMART PEOPLE. NOW NAFTA DESTROYED OUR COUNTRY, DESTROYED LARGE SECTIONS OF OUR COUNTRY AND BY THE WAY YOU TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR MANUFACTURING HERE. LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, NAFTA HAS BEEN A DISASTER. WHAT IT'S DONE TO NEW ENGLAND AND NEW YORK STATE, WHAT IT'S DONE HERE AND WHAT IT'S DONE EVERYWHERE. BILL CLINTON SIGNED IT. BILL CLINTON SIGNED IT. THAT WAS A CLINTON DEAL. IT'S BEEN HORRIBLE. NOW THEY WANT TO PASS TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. OK? THAT WILL BE WORSE THAN NAFTA AND WE WILL SUFFER. AND WE'RE GOING TO STOP THEM FROM DOING IT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THEM CONTINUE. YOU KNOW THE DOCUMENT, THE DOCUMENT IS 6000 PAGES LONG AND I GUARANTEE YOU EVERY ONE OF THOSE COUNTRIES THAT ARE INVOLVED, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM HAVE READ EVERY WORD, EVERY COMMA EVERY PARAGRAPH AND OUR GUYS HAVE NEVER EVEN READ IT I GUARANTEE YOU. 6000 PAGES FOLKS. AND ALL IT IS IS ANOTHER WAY FOR OTHER COUNTRIES TO THE BLOOD OUT -- TO SUCK THE BLOOD OUT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN.   AND LYIN' TED CRUZ IS IN FAVOR OF IT AND THE SINGLE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE THESE COMPANIES HAVE HIS MONETARY MANIPULATION WHERE THEY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR COMPANIES TO COMPETE WITH THEM SO OUR COMPANIES AND THE BLEEDING. -- SO OUR COMPANIES END UP LEAVING. SO, IT'S DEVALUATION OF THE CURRENCY, ESPECIALLY CHINA WHICH ISN'T IN THE TPP BUT THEY WILL BE BECAUSE IF IT WORKS OUT AS WELL AS PEOPLE THINK WHEN THEY RIP US OFF CHINA WILL JOIN LATER ON THROUGH THE BACK DOOR AND THEY ARE WATCHING AND I GUARANTEE YOU THEY HAVE TAUGHT PEOPLE STUDYING THAT. THEY ARE GOING TO COME IN THROUGH THE BACK DOOR AT A LATER DATE. BUT TED CRUZ ACTUALLY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE THAT THERE WAS NO LANGUAGE HAVING TO DO WITH EVALUATION, AND AND -- TO DO WITH DEVALUATION AND THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING THEY DO TO BUSINESS. AND CRUZ, AND HE WON'T TALK ABOUT IT BUT HE'S THE ONE RESPONSIBLE AND THE SENATORS ON THE LIST. I MEAN, IF YOU LOOK AT JEFF SESSIONS HIS ALL-TIME MOST RESPECTED SENATOR, SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS AND THEY TALK ABOUT HIM AT THE BEGINNING. JEFF SESSIONS IS FROM ALABAMA. A FANTASTIC GUY. HE ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP. HE ENDORSED TRUMP. THAT WAS A GREAT ENDORSEMENT. WE HAVE HAD SO MANY. WE HAVE HAD SO MANY, BUT JEFF SESSIONS, HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE MANIPULATION AND DEVALUATION OF CURRENCY AND WITHOUT THAT FOCUS WE ARE GOING TO  --  THIS WILL MAKE NAFTA LOOK LIKE A BABY. SO WE HAVE TO GET IN THERE FAST. WE HAVE TO KNOCK IT OUT AND I DON'T MIND MAKING AGREEMENTS BUT WE SHOULD NOT MAKE AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTRIES ALTOGETHER, WE SHOULD MAKE THEM ONE-ON-ONE, ONE ON ONE AND YOU KNOW WHAT, IF THEY DON'T TREAT US RIGHT WE PULLED THE AGREEMENT. WE ARE ALL BOUND UP AND YOU OUGHT TO SEE THE CHART. IT'S A CHART FROM HELL. NOBODY EVEN KNOWS IT AND I'M TELLING YOU THOSE GUYS ARE STUDYING IT AND NOBODY FROM OUR GROUP HAS EVEN READ THE DM -- HAS EVEN READ THE DAMN AGREEMENT. AND IT GOES ON FOR MANY YEARS. ONE-ON-ONE, IF SOMEBODY TREATS US WELL TO MAKE A TRADE AGREEMENT AND I WILL HAVE THE BEST NEGOTIATORS IN THE WORLD MAKE A FAIR AGREEMENT. I DON'T WANT TO BE TIED UP. IF COUNTRY A DOES THIS AND COUNTRY C DOES THAT, THEN -- NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON. THE BAD COUNTRIES THAT HAVE NOT TREATED AS WELL BENEFIT BECAUSE THEY GET THE BENEFIT OF WHAT THE GOOD COUNTRIES ARE GETTING SO EVERYBODY IS TAKING ADVANTAGE. IT'S A DISASTER. WE GO ONE-ON-ONE WITH COUNTRIES AND IF THEY TREAT US WELL WE TAKE CARE OF THEM AND IF THEY TREAT US BADLY WE CAN'T GET OUT OF IT. IT'S LIKE A SPIDER'S WEB SUCH AS REMEMBER IT AND CRUZ WANTS THAT AND SO DOES KASICH BY THE WAY. CRUZ WANTS IT SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN. OK? SO WHEN I CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR WITH MY WIFE ON JUNE 16, NOT LONG AGO AND I BROUGHT UP ALL OF THESE THINGS AND I THOUGHT AT THE TIME IT WAS GOING TO BE TRADE AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. I GAVE A SPEECH IN FROM THE BEGINNING WE WENT UP FROM, THEY WEREN'T POLLING ME BECAUSE THEY NEVER THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO RUN. THE PRESS. THEY NEVER THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO RUN. SO WE WENT UP ALMOST FROM THE BEGINNING AND WITHIN A FEW WEEKS WE WERE NUMBER ONE. PEOPLE AGREED WITH WHAT I WAS SAYING AND WE HAVE BEEN NUMBER ONE EVER SINCE. WE HAVE BEEN NUMBER ONE EVER SINCE.   AND IMPORTANTLY, I NEVER DEBATED BEFORE. I WAS AT CENTER STAGE FOR EVERY SINGLE DEBATE AND ACCORDING TO EVERY POLL AND DRUDGE AND ""TIME"" MAGAZINE, EVERY SINGLE ONE HAD ME NUMBER ONE AND I WON EVERY DEBATE. AND CRUZ I HEARD HE WAS A GOOD DEBATER. I THINK HE'S A TERRIBLE DEBATER UNLESS YOU WANT TO HEAR SHAKESPEARE. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR SHAKESPEARE. WHEN HE WAS DEBATING IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE, NOBODY INTERRUPTED HIM. WITH ME, I INTERRUPTED HIM AND HE GOT ALL LOST. IT'S CALLED THE REAL WORLD, RIGHT? IT'S CALLED THE REAL WORLD. SO EVERY DEBATE, IMPORTANTLY, RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING JUST ABOUT, I WENT TO NUMBER ONE --  OUT OF ALL THESE CHARACTERS OUT THERE. NOW HE HAS REACHED THE CEILING. I STARTED OUT AT SIX OR FIVE OR SOMETHING. AND THEY SAID, HE HAS GOT FIVE AND THAT IS HIRED THAN MOST BUT NOW HE HAS PLATEAUED AT. THE NEXT WEEK I WENT TO, LIKE 11. THEY SAID, HE HAS 11 AND THAT IS AS FAR AS HE WILL GO. YOU HAS 11 WHO LOVE THEM. THEN I WENT TO 14, THEN I WENT TO 18, THEN 24. AND THEY KEPT SAYING, HE HAS PLATEAUED. I KNOW HE HAS A TOAD YOU KNOW, THESE MORONS LIKE CARL ROVE. THE GUY IS A MORE RUN. HE STILL THINKS -- NO, NO. KARL ROVE. HE STILL THINKS ROMNEY WON. ROMNEY GOT WIPED OUT. HE SHOULD'VE WON THAT ELECTION. THAT IS AN ELECTION THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN ONE. I BACKED HIM. AND I BACKED JOHN MCCAIN. BUT I BACKED MCCAIN. HE DID NOT WIN. I BACKED ROMNEY, SHOULD'VE WON. DID NOT WIN. I SAID, THIS TIME I AM GOING TO DO IT MYSELF, FOLKS. WE ARE GOING TO WIN. WE'RE GOING TO WIN. WE'RE GOING TO WIN. SO A LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN. I TALKED ABOUT TRADE, TALKED ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. THEN YOU HAD THE KILLING OF KATE IN SAN FRANCISCO. SHOT IN THE BACK BY SOMEONE WHO SHOULD'VE NEVER BEEN ALLOWED IN THIS COUNTRY. THEN YOU HAD JAMIL IN CALIFORNIA. A YOUNG BOY. HIS FATHER BECAME A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE. SAN FRANCISCO. LOS ANGELES AREA, CALIFORNIA. HE WAS KILLED. HIS FATHER IS A GREAT GUY. HIS SON WAS TAKEN FOR IT AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT. SHOT THROUGH THE BASE -- THROUGH THE FACE THREE OR FOUR TIMES FOR DOING NOTHING. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL. AND THEN YOU HAD, AND THEN YOU HAD THE INCREDIBLE VETERAN, 65-YEAR-OLD WOMAN RAPED, SODOMIZED, A AND KILLED IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE. NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE. WE'RE NOT TAKING IT ANYMORE. AND THEN, THE POLLS A START COMING OUT WORD TRIBE IS DEFINITELY THE BEST ON THE BORDER AND BEST ON EVERYTHING. BEST ON EVERYTHING EXCEPT THEY DID NOT LIKE MY PERSONALITY. WHO CARES ABOUT MY PERSONALITY? I THINK I AM A NICER PERSON THAN MOST OF THEM. THE ONLY THING I DID NOT DO WELL ON WAS PERSONALITY. AND BY THE WAY, THE WOMEN. NO ONE RESPECTS WOMEN MORE THAN I DO. I WILL TELL YOU THAT. AND WOMEN ARE LOOKING FOR SECURITY IN OUR COUNTRY AND THEY KNOW I AM GOING TO DO THE BEST JOB. LOOK AT HILLARY. WITH HER CALL. REMEMBER THAT AD? WHO IS GOING TO BE AWAKE AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING? WHEN THEY CALLED FROM BENGHAZI SHE WAS SLEEPING. SHE WAS SLEEPING. SHE WAS SLEEPING. WHO IS GOING TO BE AWAKE? SHE WAS NOT AWAKE. SO ALL OF THE POLLS ARE DOING GREAT. AND WE HAVE BEEN DOING AMAZING. BUT THEN YOU HAD A THING CALLED PARIS. PARIS. 130 PEOPLE WERE KILLED, HUNDREDS OH OF PEOPLE LYING IN THE HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW INJURED SO BADLY THEIR LIVES ARE DESTROYED. YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT WENT IN AND JUST BOOM, BOOM. BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE WORLD PARIS, FRANCE, SHOOTING PEOPLE, KILLING PEOPLE, HURTING PEOPLE. PEOPLE ARE SO BADLY INJURED, HUNDREDS OF THEM. THEN YOU HAD SAN BERNARDINO. YOU HAD A RADICALIZED COUPLE COME OUT. THEY WERE GIVEN A BABY SHOWER BY THE SAME PEOPLE THEY KILLED A SHORT WHILE LATER. BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. NO GUNS ON THE OTHER SIDE. LET ME TELL YOU. IF YOU HAD GUNS ON THE OTHER SIDE, WHETHER IT'S PARIS, SAN BERNARDINO, SOME OF THE MILITARY PEOPLE THAT WERE KILLED. IT WOULD'VE BEEN A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY IF THOSE PEOPLE HAD GUNS. A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY, FOLKS. AND, IN FACT, IT MAY HAVE NEVER EVEN HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THESE PEOPLE FOUND OUT, IF THEY FOUND OUT THERE WERE GUNS IN THE ROOM, THEY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE NEVER EVEN GONE OUT. OK? IT WOULD'VE BEEN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY. SO WE WILL PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. AND WE ARE REALLY GOING TO PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT, OK? WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF IT AND CHERISH IT BECAUSE THEY ARE CHIPPING AWAY, CHIPPING AWAY AT THE SECOND AMENDMENT WILL STOP -- CHIPPING AWAY AT THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN. THE STORY IS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR PEOPLE. WE'RE GOING TO NEGOTIATE DEALS. WE WANT OTHER COUNTRIES TO DO WELL. BUT IT IS GOING TO BE AMERICA FIRST. WHEN WE HAVE 19 TRILLION IN DEBT GOING TO 21 TRILLION BECAUSE OF THE HORRIBLE BUDGET, THE OMNIBUS BUDGET. THE OMNIBUS. WHICH BY THE WAY, FINDS -- FUNDS OBAMACARE. FUNDS SYRIANS COMING IN WHERE WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY ARE COMING IN. THEY ARE COMING HERE. IT IS FUNDING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COMING IN. AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS. YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS SAY THAT OBAMA IS A HORRIBLE NEGOTIATOR EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES TO NEGOTIATING WITH THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS. HE GETS EVERYTHING HE WANTS. AND WHAT HAPPENS? AND WE SEND THESE PEOPLE OFF, AND I AM A FAN OF THE TEA PARTY WHICH HAS BEEN MALIGNED OVER THE YEARS. OK? IT HAS JUST BEEN MALIGNED. BUT I AM A FAN. WE SEND THESE PEOPLE AND THEY GO, WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE. THEY GET ELECTED, RIGHT? THEN THEY GO AND THEY LOOK AT THE BEAUTIFUL HOMES GONE THE BEAUTIFUL CEILINGS, THE MARBLE, THE STATUES, AND SOMETHING HAPPENS. THEY BECOME LOST. HE LOOKS AT HIS WIFE AND HE GOES, ALICE WE HAVE FINALLY ARRIVED. AND THEN THEY VOTE FOR EVERYTHING. THAT IS NOT HAPPENING WITH ME. IT IS NOT HAPPENING WITH THE, FOLKS. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. SO, SO, IT HAS BEEN SUCH AN HONOR AND I AM GOING TO TRY TO SEE THE OTHER TWO ROOMS. MAYBE I WILL BRING CARL CAMERON WITH ME. BUT I'M GOING TO TRY TO STOP BY BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU. IT HAS BEEN JUST AN HONOR. AND HOPEFULLY TOMORROW, IN AND GET EVERY FRIEND YOU HAVE THAT CAN VOTE. EVERY FRIEND YOU CAN HAVE. EVERYBODY. BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, YOU ARE GOING TO REMEMBER THIS EVENING. THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. THANK YOU. [CHEERS  THANK YOU. YOU GOT TO REMEMBER THIS EVENING. WE HAD A GOOD TIME. WITH A BAD SUBJECT. BAD SUBJECT, OUR COUNTRY IS DOING TERRIBLY. YOU KNOW, THE REAL JOB NUMBER IS 20% OR MORE. NOT 5%. THAT WAS PUT IN TO MAKE POLITICIANS LOOK GOOD. IF YOU STOP LOOKING FOR A JOB, LOOKING, LOOKING, LOOKING, IF YOU STOP LOOKING THEY CONSIDER YOU STATISTICALLY EMPLOYED. WE'RE GOING TO BRING JOBS BACK TO OUR COUNTRY AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET PEOPLE LEAVE SO EASILY ANYMORE. SO YOU ARE GOING TO REMEMBER THIS NIGHT, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOU'RE GOING TO REMEMBER THE VOTE YOU CAST TOMORROW. AND YOU ARE GOING TO SAY, WHEN YOU LOOK ACT -- BACK IN FIVE YEARS, 20 YEARS, 50 YEARS, WE HAVE SOMEBODY YOUNG PEOPLE. I THINK I HAVE YOUNGER PEOPLE THEN BERNIE. BY THE WAY, BERNIE SANDERS, HIS SYSTEM IS RIGGED ALSO. ONLY THE REPUBLICANS RAKE IT IN -- RIGGING IT IN A MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED WAY WITHOUT THE SUPERDELEGATE THING. BUT BERNIE, HE WINS, HE WINS, HE WINS. AND THEN YOU WATCH THESE GUYS, HE CAN'T WIN. BUT HERE'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO. YOU HAVE GOT TO VOTE. AND, WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS MOVEMENT GOING. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SO GREAT, MAY BE GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SUFFER AND TED CRUZ WILL LOSE THE BIGGEST LANDSLIDE IN HISTORY. AND JOHN KASICH, WHEN HE GETS IT WITH A NEGATIVE AD. I HAVE HAD 60,000 NEGATIVE AD. TED CRUZ HAS HAD NONE. JOHN KASICH HAS HAD NONE. WHEN THEY GET HIT WITH THEIR FIRST NEGATIVE AD, THEY ARE OVER. WITH ME, I THINK WE ARE IMMUNE TO THAT. AND THE ADS WERE WRONG. THE ADS ARE TOTALLY PHONY ADS. BUT HERE'S THE STORY. YOU ARE GOING TO LOOK BACK YEARS FROM NOW AND SAY, IT WAS THE SINGLE GREATEST VOTE YOU'VE EVER CAST. AND HERE'S WHY. BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY, OUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH OUR MILITARY. IT IS BEING DEPLETED. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD UP OUR MILITARY. MAKE IT STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE.   AND WE ARE GOING TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS, JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND. WE HAVE NO CHOICE. WE HAVE NO CHOICE. AS PART OF THAT, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR GREAT VETERANS. OUR VETERANS HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. VERY UNFAIR.   WE ARE GOING TO WIN ON EDUCATION. WE'RE GETTING RID OF COMMON CORE. WE'RE BRINGING EDUCATION LOCAL. WE'RE GOING TO WIN ON EDUCATION. WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL OBAMACARE AND IT WE ARE GOING TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS SO MUCH BETTER AND LESS EXPENSIVE. WE ARE GOING TO SAVE AND PROTECT AND CHERISH OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. [CHEERS AND  WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL. WE'RE GOING TO MEXICO PAY FOR THE WALL. AND WE'RE GOING TO OUR STRONG BORDERS AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE COME INTO OUR COUNTRY, BUT THEY'RE GOING TO COME AND LEGALLY. LEGALLY. AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE UNBELIEVABLY GOOD TRADE DEALS. NO MORE STUPID DEALS WHERE OUR BUSINESSES AND MONEY GETS SUCKED OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE GREAT, GREAT DEALS MADE BY THE GREATEST PEOPLE. WE HAVE THE GREATEST NEGOTIATORS IN THE WORLD RIGHT HERE IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE ARE GOING TO USE THEM, NOT POLITICAL HACKS THAT DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND PROBABLY, WHO THE HELL KNOWS, THEY ARE BOUGHT OFF AND THEY'RE MAKING SUCH BAD DEALS. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE BEST TRADE DEALS. AND YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK BACK AND YOU ARE GOING TO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT IS WHEN WE STARTED WINNING AGAIN. WHEN TRUMP TOOK OVER. WE'RE GOING TO WIN AND WHEN, AND YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, PLEASE MR. TRUMP I CANNOT TAKE IT. BUT I DON'T CARE, WE'RE GOING TO WIN AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I LOVE YOU. THANK YOU, INDIANA. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. THANK YOU, INDIANA. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. ","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Rally in South Bend, Indiana"

IT TRULY IS A GREAT HONOR. I'D LIKE TO TALK TODAY ABOUT HOW TO DEVELOP A NEW FOREIGN POLICY DIRECTION FOR OUR COUNTRY, ONE THAT REPLACES RANDOMNESS WITH PURPOSE, IDEOLOGY WITH STRATEGY, AND CHAOS WITH PEACE. IT'S TIME TO SHAKE THE RUST OFF AMERICA'S FOREIGN POLICY. IT'S TIME TO INVITE NEW VOICES AND NEW VISIONS INTO THE FOLD, SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DO. THE DIRECTION I WILL OUTLINE TODAY WILL ALSO RETURN US TO A TIMELESS PRINCIPLE. MY FOREIGN POLICY WILL ALWAYS PUT THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND AMERICAN SECURITY ABOVE ALL ELSE. IT HAS TO BE FIRST, HAS TO BE. THAT WILL BE THE FOUNDATION OF EVERY SINGLE DECISION THAT I WILL MAKE.   AMERICA FIRST WILL BE THE MAJOR AND OVERRIDING THEME OF MY ADMINISTRATION. BUT TO CHART OUR PATH FORWARD, WE MUST FIRST BRIEFLY TAKE A LOOK BACK. WE HAVE A LOT TO BE PROUD OF. IN THE 1940'S, WE SAVED THE WORLD. THE GREATEST GENERATION BEAT BACK THE NAZIS AND JAPANESE IMPERIALISTS. THEN, WE SAVED THE WORLD AGAIN.  THIS TIME, FROM TOTALITARIANISM AND COMMUNISM. THE COLD WAR, IT LASTED FOR DECADES BUT, GUESS WHAT, WE WON , AND WE WON BIG.  DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WORKING TOGETHER GOT MR. GORBACHEV TO HEED THE WORDS OF PRESIDENT REAGAN, OUR GREAT PRESIDENT, WHEN HE SAID, TEAR ""TEAR DOWN THIS WALL.""   HISTORY WILL NOT FORGET WHAT HE DID. A VERY SPECIAL, SPECIAL MAN AND PRESIDENT.  UNFORTUNATELY, AFTER THE COLD WAR, OUR FOREIGN POLICY VEERED BADLY OFF COURSE. WE FAILED TO DEVELOP A NEW VISION FOR A NEW TIME. IN FACT, AS TIME WENT ON, OUR FOREIGN POLICY BEGAN TO MAKE LESS AND LESS SENSE.  LOGIC WAS REPLACED WITH FOOLISHNESS AND ARROGANCE, WHICH LED TO ONE FOREIGN POLICY DISASTER AFTER ANOTHER. THEY JUST KEPT COMING AND COMING. WE WENT FROM MISTAKES IN IRAQ TO EGYPT TO LIBYA, TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LINE IN THE SAND IN SYRIA. EACH OF THESE ACTIONS HAVE HELPED TO THROW THE REGION INTO CHAOS, AND GAVE ISIS THE SPACE IT NEEDS TO GROW AND PROSPER.  VERY BAD. IT ALL BEGAN WITH A DANGEROUS IDEA THAT WE COULD MAKE WESTERN DEMOCRACIES OUT OF COUNTRIES THAT HAD NO EXPERIENCE OR INTERESTS IN BECOMING A WESTERN DEMOCRACY. WE TORE UP WHAT INSTITUTIONS THEY HAD, AND THEN WERE SURPRISED AT WHAT WE UNLEASHED. CIVIL WAR, RELIGIOUS FANATICISM, THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS AND JUST KILLED -- LIVES, LIVES, LIVES WASTED. HORRIBLY WASTED. MANY TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS WERE LOST, AS A RESULT.  THE VACUUM WAS CREATED THAT ISIS WOULD FILL.  IRAN, TOO, WOULD RUSH IN AND FILL THAT VOID, MUCH TO THEIR REALLY UNJUST ENRICHMENT. THEY HAVE BENEFITED SO MUCH, SO SADLY, FOR US. OUR FOREIGN POLICY IS A COMPLETE AND TOTAL DISASTER. NO VISION. NO PURPOSE. NO DIRECTION. NO STRATEGY. TODAY, I WANT TO IDENTIFY FIVE MAIN WEAKNESSES IN OUR FOREIGN POLICY. FIRST, OUR RESOURCES ARE TOTALLY OVER-EXTENDED. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS WEAKENED OUR MILITARY, BY WEAKENING OUR ECONOMY.  HE'S CRIPPLED US WITH WASTEFUL SPENDING, MASSIVE DEBT, LOW GROWTH, A HUGE TRADE DEFICIT, AND OPEN BORDERS. OUR MANUFACTURING TRADE DEFICIT WITH THE WORLD IS NOW APPROACHING $1 TRILLION A YEAR. WE'RE REBUILDING OTHER COUNTRIES, WHILE WEAKENING OUR OWN. ENDING THE THEFT OF AMERICAN JOBS WILL GIVE US RESOURCES WE NEED TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY, WHICH HAS TO HAPPEN, AND REGAIN OUR FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE AND STRENGTH. I AM THE ONLY PERSON RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY WHO UNDERSTANDS THIS, AND THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. I'M THE ONLY ONE - BELIEVE ME, I KNOW THEM ALL -- I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO FIX IT.   SECONDLY, OUR ALLIES ARE NOT PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE, AND I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS RECENTLY A LOT. OUR ALLIES MUST CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THEIR FINANCIAL, POLITICAL, AND HUMAN COSTS, HAVE TO DO IT, OF OUR TREMENDOUS SECURITY BURDEN.  BUT MANY OF THEM ARE SIMPLY NOT DOING SO. THEY LOOK AT THE UNITED STATES AS WEAK AND FORGIVING, AND FEEL NO OBLIGATION TO HONOR THEIR AGREEMENTS WITH US. IN NATO, FOR INSTANCE, ONLY 4 OF 28 OTHER MEMBER COUNTRIES , BESIDES AMERICA, ARE SPENDING THE MINIMUM REQUIRED 2% OF GDP ON DEFENSE. WE HAVE SPENT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER TIME ON PLANES, MISSILES, SHIPS, EQUIPMENT, BUILDING UP OUR MILITARY TO PROVIDE A STRONG DEFENSE FOR EUROPE AND ASIA. THE COUNTRIES WE ARE DEFENDING MUST PAY FOR THE COST OF THIS DEFENSE, AND IF NOT, THE U.S. MUST BE PREPARED TO LET THESE COUNTRIES DEFEND THEMSELVES. WE HAVE NO CHOICE.   THE WHOLE WORLD WILL BE SAFER IF OUR ALLIES DO THEIR PART TO SUPPORT OUR COMMON DEFENSE AND SECURITY. A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL LEAD A FREE WORLD THAT IS PROPERLY ARMED AND FUNDED, AND FUNDED BEAUTIFULLY. THIRDLY, OUR FRIENDS ARE BEGINNING TO THINK THEY CAN'T DEPEND ON US. WE'VE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO DISLIKES OUR FRIENDS, AND BOWS TO OUR ENEMIES, SOMETHING THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.  HE NEGOTIATED A DISASTROUS DEAL WITH IRAN, AND THEN WE WATCHED THEM IGNORE ITS TERMS, EVEN BEFORE THE INK WAS DRY.  IRAN CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON, CANNOT BE ALLOWED. REMEMBER THAT, CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON.   AND UNDER A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, WILL NEVER, EVER BE ALLOWED TO HAVE THAT NUCLEAR WEAPON.   ALL OF THIS, WITHOUT EVEN MENTIONING THE HUMILIATION OF THE UNITED STATES WITH IRAN'S TREATMENT OF OUR TEN CAPTURED SAILORS - SO VIVIDLY I REMEMBER THAT DAY.  IN NEGOTIATION, YOU MUST BE WILLING TO WALK. THE IRAN DEAL, LIKE SO MANY OF OUR WORST AGREEMENTS, IS THE RESULT OF NOT BEING WILLING TO LEAVE THE TABLE. WHEN THE OTHER SIDE KNOWS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WALK, IT BECOMES ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN -- YOU JUST CAN'T WIN. AT THE SAME TIME, YOUR FRIENDS NEED TO KNOW THAT YOU WILL STICK BY THE AGREEMENTS THAT YOU HAVE WITH THEM. YOU'VE MADE THAT AGREEMENT, YOU HAVE TO STAND BY IT, AND THE WORLD WILL BE A BETTER PLACE.  PRESIDENT OBAMA GUTTED OUR MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAM AND THEN ABANDONED OUR MISSILE DEFENSE PLANS WITH POLAND AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC. HE SUPPORTED THE OUSTER OF A FRIENDLY REGIME IN EGYPT, THAT HAD A LONGSTANDING PEACE TREATY WITH ISRAEL, AND THEN HELPED BRING THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD TO POWER IN ITS PLACE. ISRAEL, OUR GREAT FRIEND AND THE ONE TRUE DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, HAS BEEN SNUBBED AND CRITICIZED BY AN ADMINISTRATION THAT LACKS MORAL CLARITY. JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN AGAIN CRITICIZED ISRAEL, A FORCE FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE, FOR ACTING AS AN IMPATIENT PEACE AREA IN THE REGION. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS NOT BEEN A FRIEND TO ISRAEL. HE HAS TREATED IRAN WITH TENDER LOVE AND CARE, AND MADE IT A GREAT POWER.  IRAN HAS, INDEED, BECOME A GREAT, GREAT POWER, IN JUST A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'VE DONE. ALL OF THE EXPENSE AND ALL AT THE EXPENSE OF ISRAEL, OUR ALLIES IN THE REGION, AND VERY IMPORTANTLY, THE UNITED STATES, ITSELF.   WE'VE PICKED FIGHTS WITH OUR OLDEST FRIENDS, AND NOW, THEY'RE STARTING TO LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR HELP.  REMEMBER THAT. NOT GOOD. FOURTH, OUR RIVALS NO LONGER RESPECT US. IN FACT, THEY'RE JUST AS CONFUSED AS OUR ALLIES, BUT IN AN EVEN BIGGER PROBLEM IS THEY DON'T TAKE US SERIOUSLY ANYMORE. THE TRUTH IS THEY DON'T RESPECT US. WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA LANDED IN CUBA ON AIR FORCE ONE, NO LEADER WAS THERE, NOBODY, TO GREET HIM. PERHAPS AN INCIDENT WITHOUT PRECEDENT IN THE LONG AND PRESTIGIOUS HISTORY OF AIR FORCE ONE. THEN, AMAZINGLY, THE SAME THING HAPPENED IN SAUDI ARABIA. IT'S CALLED NO RESPECT. ABSOLUTELY NO RESPECT. DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN THE PRESIDENT MADE A LONG AND EXPENSIVE TRIP TO COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, TO GET THE OLYMPICS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND AFTER THIS UNPRECEDENTED EFFORT, IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE UNITED STATES CAME IN FOURTH -- FOURTH PLACE?  THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES MAKING THIS TRIP - UNPRECEDENTED - COMES IN FOURTH PLACE. HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THE RESULT , BEFORE MAKING SUCH AN EMBARRASSING COMMITMENT.  WE WERE LAUGHED AT ALL OVER THE WORLD, AS WE HAVE BEEN MANY, MANY TIMES. THE LIST OF HUMILIATIONS GO ON AND ON AND ON. PRESIDENT OBAMA WATCHES HELPLESSLY, AS NORTH KOREA INCREASES ITS AGGRESSION AND EXPANDS FURTHER AND FURTHER WITH ITS NUCLEAR REACH. OUR PRESIDENT HAS ALLOWED CHINA TO CONTINUE ITS ECONOMIC ASSAULT ON AMERICAN JOBS AND WEALTH, REFUSING TO ENFORCE TRADE DEALS AND APPLY LEVERAGE ON CHINA , NECESSARY TO REIN IN NORTH KOREA.  WE HAVE THE LEVERAGE. WE HAVE THE POWER OVER CHINA, ECONOMIC POWER, AND PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. AND WITH THAT ECONOMIC POWER, WE CAN REIN IN AND WE CAN GET THEM TO DO WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO WITH NORTH KOREA, WHICH IS TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. HE HAS EVEN ALLOWED CHINA TO STEAL GOVERNMENT SECRETS WITH CYBER ATTACKS, AND ENGAGED IN INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE AGAINST THE UNITED STATES AND ITS COMPANIES. WE'VE LET OUR RIVALS AND CHALLENGERS THINK THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING, AND THEY DO. THEY DO, AT WILL. IT ALWAYS HAPPENS.  IF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S GOAL HAD BEEN TO WEAKEN AMERICA, HE COULD NOT HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB. FINALLY, AMERICA NO LONGER HAS A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FOREIGN POLICY GOALS. SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR, AND THE BREAKUP OF THE SOVIET UNION, WE'VE LACKED A COHERENT FOREIGN POLICY. ONE DAY, WE'RE BOMBING LIBYA AND GETTING RID OF A DICTATOR TO FOSTER DEMOCRACY FOR CIVILIANS. THE NEXT DAY, WE'RE WATCHING THE SAME CIVILIANS SUFFER, WHILE THAT COUNTRY FALLS AND ABSOLUTELY FALLS APART. LIVES LOST, MASSIVE MONEYS LOST. THE WORLD IS A DIFFERENT PLACE. WE'RE A HUMANITARIAN NATION, BUT THE LEGACY OF THE OBAMA-CLINTON WILL BE WEAKNESS, CONFUSION, AND DISARRAY, A MESS. WE'VE MADE THE MIDDLE EAST MORE UNSTABLE AND CHAOTIC THAN EVER BEFORE. WE LEFT CHRISTIANS SUBJECT TO INTENSE PERSECUTION, AND EVEN GENOCIDE.   WE HAVE DONE NOTHING TO HELP THE CHRISTIANS, NOTHING, AND WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE ASHAMED FOR THAT, FOR THAT LACK OF ACTION. OUR ACTIONS IN IRAQ, LIBYA, AND SYRIA HAVE HELPED UNLEASH ISIS. AND WE'RE IN A WAR AGAINST RADICAL ISLAM, BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA WON'T EVEN NAME THE ENEMY, AND UNLESS YOU NAME THE ENEMY, YOU WILL NEVER, EVER SOLVE THE PROBLEM.   HILLARY CLINTON ALSO REFUSES TO SAY THE WORDS ""RADICAL ISLAM,"" EVEN AS SHE PUSHES FOR A MASSIVE INCREASE IN REFUGEES COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. AFTER SECRETARY CLINTON'S FAILED INTERVENTION IN LIBYA, ISLAMIC TERRORISTS IN BENGHAZI TOOK DOWN OUR CONSULATE AND KILLED OUR AMBASSADOR AND THREE BRAVE AMERICANS. THEN, INSTEAD OF TAKING CHARGE THAT NIGHT, HILLARY CLINTON DECIDED TO GO HOME AND SLEEP. INCREDIBLE. CLINTON BLAMES IT ALL ON A VIDEO, AN EXCUSE THAT WAS A TOTAL LIE, PROVEN TO BE ABSOLUTELY A TOTAL LIE. OUR AMBASSADOR WAS MURDERED AND OUR SECRETARY OF STATE MISLED THE NATION.  AND, BY THE WAY, SHE WAS NOT AWAKE TO TAKE THAT CALL AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING. AND NOW, ISIS IS MAKING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A WEEK SELLING LIBYA OIL. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WE DON'T BLOCKADE, WE DON'T BOMB, WE DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. IT'S ALMOST AS IF OUR COUNTRY DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING, WHICH COULD BE A FACT , AND COULD BE TRUE. THIS WILL ALL CHANGE, WHEN I BECOME PRESIDENT. TO OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES, I SAY , AMERICA IS GOING TO BE STRONG AGAIN. AMERICA IS GOING TO BE RELIABLE AGAIN. IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT AND RELIABLE ALLY AGAIN. IT'S GOING TO BE A FRIEND AGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO FINALLY HAVE A COHERENT FOREIGN POLICY, BASED UPON AMERICAN INTERESTS AND THE SHARED INTERESTS OF OUR ALLIES.   WE'RE GETTING OUT OF THE NATION-BUILDING BUSINESS AND INSTEAD, FOCUSING ON CREATING STABILITY IN THE WORLD. OUR MOMENTS OF GREATEST STRENGTH CAME WHEN POLITICS ENDED AT THE WATER'S EDGE. WE NEED A NEW, RATIONAL, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY, INFORMED BY THE BEST MINDS AND SUPPORTED BY BOTH PARTIES, AND IT WILL BE BY BOTH PARTIES - DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, EVERYBODY, AS WELL AS BY OUR CLOSE ALLIES. THIS IS HOW WE WON THE COLD WAR, AND IT'S HOW WE WILL WIN OUR NEW , FUTURE STRUGGLES, WHICH MAY BE MANY, WHICH MAY BE COMPLEX, BUT WE WILL WIN IF I BECOME PRESIDENT.   FIRST, WE NEED A LONG-TERM PLAN TO HALT THE SPREAD AND REACH OF RADICAL ISLAM. IN CONTAINING THE SPREAD OF RADICAL ISLAM MUST BE A MAJOR FOREIGN POLICY GOAL OF THE UNITED STATES, AND INDEED THE WORLD. EVENTS MAY REQUIRE THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE, BUT IT'S ALSO A PHILOSOPHICAL STRUGGLE, LIKE OUR LONG STRUGGLE IN THE COLD WAR. IN THIS, WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR ALLIES IN THE MUSLIM WORLD, ALL OF WHICH ARE AT RISK FROM RADICAL ISLAMIC VIOLENCE, ATTACKS, AND EVERYTHING ELSE.  IT IS A DANGEROUS WORLD, MORE DANGEROUS NOW THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN. WE SHOULD WORK -- THANK YOU.   WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER WITH ANY NATION IN THE REGION THAT IS THREATENED BY THE RISE OF RADICAL ISLAM.  BUT THIS HAS TO BE A TWO-WAY STREET. THEY MUST ALSO BE GOOD TO US. REMEMBER THAT.  THEY HAVE TO BE GOOD TO US, NO LONGER ONE-WAY. IT'S NOW TWO-WAY. AND REMEMBER, US AND ALL WE'RE DOING, THEY HAVE TO APPRECIATE WHAT WE'VE DONE TO THEM.  WE'RE GOING TO HELP, BUT THEY HAVE TO APPRECIATE WHAT WE'VE DONE FOR THEM.  THE STRUGGLE AGAINST RADICAL ISLAM ALSO TAKES PLACE IN OUR HOMELAND.  THERE ARE SCORES OF RECENT YOU MIGRANTS, INSIDE OUR BORDERS, CHARGED WITH TERRORISM. FOR EVERY CASE KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC, THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF MORE. WE MUST STOP IMPORTING EXTREMISM THROUGH SENSELESS IMMIGRATION POLICIES. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THESE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM. THERE'S NO DOCUMENTATION. THERE'S NO PAPERWORK. THERE'S NOTHING. WE HAVE TO BE SMART. WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT. A PAUSE FOR REASSESSMENT WILL HELP US TO PREVENT THE NEXT SAN BERNARDINO, OR FRANKLY, MUCH WORSE. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER AND SEPTEMBER 11TH, ONE OF THE GREAT CATASTROPHES, IN MY OPINION, THE SINGLE GREATEST MILITARY CATASTROPHE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WORSE THAN PEARL HARBOR, BECAUSE YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED, AND CITIZENS WERE ATTACKED, AS OPPOSED TO THE MILITARY BEING ATTACKED -- ONE OF THE TRUE GREAT CATASTROPHES. AND THEN, THERE'S ISIS.  I HAVE A SIMPLE MESSAGE FOR THEM.  THEIR DAYS ARE NUMBERED. I WON'T TELL THEM WHERE, AND I WON'T TELL THEM HOW.  WE MUST --   WE MUST, AS A NATION, BE MORE UNPREDICTABLE. WE ARE TOTALLY PREDICTABLE.  WE TELL EVERYTHING. WE'RE SENDING TROOPS.  WE TELL THEM. WE'RE SENDING SOMETHING ELSE.  WE HAVE A NEWS CONFERENCE.  WE HAVE TO BE UNPREDICTABLE. AND WE HAVE TO BE UNPREDICTABLE, STARTING NOW. BUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE GONE.  ISIS WILL BE GONE, IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT. AND THEY'LL BE GONE QUICKLY.  THEY WILL BE GONE VERY, VERY QUICKLY.   SECONDLY, WE HAVE TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY AND OUR ECONOMY. THE RUSSIANS AND CHINESE HAVE RAPIDLY EXPANDED THEIR MILITARY CAPABILITY, BUT LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO US.  OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARSENAL, OUR ULTIMATE DETERRENT, HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO ATROPHY AND IS DESPERATELY IN NEED OF MODERNIZATION AND RENEWAL. AND IT HAS TO HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY. OUR ACTIVE DUTY ARMED FORCES HAVE SHRUNK FROM 2 MILLION IN 1991 TO ABOUT 1.3 MILLION TODAY. THE NAVY HAS SHRUNK FROM OVER 500 SHIPS TO 272 SHIPS, DURING THIS SAME PERIOD OF TIME. THE AIR FORCE IS ABOUT ONE-THIRD SMALLER THAN 1991. PILOTS FLYING B-52S IN COMBAT MISSIONS TODAY. THESE PLANES ARE OLDER THAN VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM. AND WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT THIS? PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS PROPOSED A 2017 DEFENSE BUDGET THAT IN REAL DOLLARS, CUTS NEARLY 25% FROM WHAT WE WERE SPENDING IN 2011. OUR MILITARY IS DEPLETED, AND WE'RE ASKING OUR GENERALS AND MILITARY LEADERS TO WORRY ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING. WE WILL SPEND WHAT WE NEED TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY. IT IS THE CHEAPEST, SINGLE INVESTMENT WE CAN MAKE. WE WILL DEVELOP, BUILD, AND PURCHASE THE BEST EQUIPMENT KNOWN TO MANKIND.  OUR MILITARY DOMINANCE MUST BE UNQUESTIONED, AND I MEAN UNQUESTIONED, BY ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY. BUT WE WILL LOOK FOR SAVINGS AND SPEND OUR MONEY WISELY. IN THIS TIME OF MOUNTING DEBT, RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE SO MUCH DEBT THAT NOBODY EVEN KNOWS HOW TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.  BUT I DO. NO ONE DOLLAR CAN BE WASTED. NOT ONE SINGLE DOLLAR CAN WE WASTE. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE OUR TRADE, IMMIGRATION, AND ECONOMIC POLICIES TO MAKE OUR ECONOMY STRONG AGAIN. AND TO PUT AMERICANS FIRST AGAIN. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT OUR OWN WORKERS, RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA, GET THE JOBS AND HIGHER PAY THAT WILL GROW OUR TAX REVENUES, INCREASE OUR ECONOMIC MIGHT AS A NATION, MAKE US STRONG FINANCIALLY AGAIN. SO, SO IMPORTANT. WE NEED TO THINK SMART ABOUT AREAS WHERE OUR TECHNOLOGICAL SUPERIORITY, AND NOBODY COMES CLOSE, GIVES US AN EDGE. THIS INCLUDES 3D PRINTING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AND CYBER WARFARE. A GREAT COUNTRY ALSO TAKES CARE OF ITS WARRIORS. OUR COMMITMENT TO THEM IS ABSOLUTE, AND I MEAN ABSOLUTE. A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL GIVE OUR SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN THE BEST EQUIPMENT AND SUPPORT IN THE WORLD, WHEN THEY SERVE AND WHERE THEY SERVE. AND THE BEST CARE IN THE WORLD, WHEN THEY RETURN AS VETERANS AND THEY COME BACK HOME TO CIVILIAN LIFE. OUR VETERANS --   OUR VETERANS HAVE NOT BEEN TREATED FAIRLY OR JUSTLY. THESE ARE OUR GREAT PEOPLE, AND WE MUST TREAT THEM FAIRLY. WE MUST EVEN TREAT THEM REALLY, REALLY WELL, AND THAT WILL HAPPEN, UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.   FINALLY, WE MUST DEVELOP A FOREIGN POLICY BASED ON AMERICAN INTERESTS. BUSINESSES DO NOT SUCCEED WHEN THEY LOSE SIGHT OF THEIR CORE INTERESTS, AND NEITHER DO COUNTRIES. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 1990'S. OUR EMBASSIES IN KENYA AND TANZANIA - AND THIS WAS A HORRIBLE PERIOD OF TIME FOR US - WERE ATTACKED. AND 17 BRAVE SAILORS WERE KILLED ON THE U.S.S. COLE. AND WHAT DID WE DO? IT SEEMED WE PUT MORE EFFORT INTO ADDING CHINA INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, WHICH HAS BEEN A TOTAL DISASTER FOR THE UNITED STATES. FRANKLY, WE SPENT MORE TIME ON THAT, THAN WE DID IN STOPPING AL QAEDA. WE EVEN HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE OUT OSAMA BIN LADEN, AND WE DIDN'T DO IT. AND THEN, WE GOT HIT AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER AND THE PENTAGON. AGAIN, THE WORST ATTACK ON OUR COUNTRY, IN ITS HISTORY. OUR FOREIGN POLICY GOALS MUST BE BASED ON AMERICA'S CORE NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS. AND THE FOLLOWING WILL BE MY PRIORITIES. IN THE MIDDLE EAST, OUR GOALS MUST BE, AND I MEAN MUST BE, TO DEFEAT TERRORISTS AND PROMOTE REGIONAL STABILITY, NOT RADICAL CHANGE. WE NEED TO BE CLEAR-SIGHTED ABOUT THE GROUPS THAT WILL NEVER BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN ENEMIES. AND, BELIEVE ME, WE HAVE GROUPS THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, THEY WILL BE THE ENEMY. WE HAVE TO BE SMART ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE WHO THOSE GROUPS ARE, WHO THOSE PEOPLE ARE, AND NOT HELP THEM. AND WE MUST ONLY BE GENEROUS TO THOSE THAT PROVE THEY ARE INDEED OUR FRIENDS.   WE DESIRE TO LIVE PEACEFULLY AND IN FRIENDSHIP WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA. WE HAVE SERIOUS DIFFERENCES WITH THESE TWO NATIONS, AND MUST REGARD THEM WITH OPEN EYES, BUT WE ARE NOT BOUND TO BE ADVERSARIES. WE SHOULD SEEK COMMON GROUND, BASED ON SHARED INTERESTS. RUSSIA, FOR INSTANCE, HAS ALSO SEEN THE HORROR OF ISLAMIC TERRORISM. I BELIEVE AN EASING OF TENSIONS, AND IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA, FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH ONLY, IS POSSIBLE, ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE. COMMON SENSE SAYS THIS CYCLE, THIS HORRIBLE CYCLE OF HOSTILITY , MUST END, AND IDEALLY WILL END SOON.  GOOD FOR BOTH COUNTRIES. SOME SAY THE RUSSIANS WON'T BE REASONABLE. I INTEND TO FIND OUT. IF WE CAN'T MAKE A DEAL UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, A DEAL THAT'S GREAT - NOT GOOD, GREAT - FOR AMERICA, BUT ALSO GOOD FOR RUSSIA, THEN WE WILL QUICKLY WALK FROM THE TABLE. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT. FIXING OUR RELATIONS WITH CHINA IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT STEP - AND REALLY TOWARD CREATING AN EVEN MORE PROSPEROUS PERIOD OF TIME. CHINA RESPECTS STRENGTH AND BY LETTING THEM TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US ECONOMICALLY, WHICH THEY ARE DOING LIKE NEVER BEFORE, WE HAVE LOST ALL OF THEIR RESPECT. WE HAVE A MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA, A DEFICIT THAT WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY QUICKLY, AND I MEAN QUICKLY, TO BALANCE. A STRONG AND SMART AMERICA IS AN AMERICA THAT WILL FIND A BETTER FRIEND IN CHINA, BETTER THAN WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. LOOK AT WHAT CHINA IS DOING IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA. THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DOING IT. NO RESPECT FOR THIS COUNTRY, OR THIS PRESIDENT. WE CAN BOTH BENEFIT, OR WE CAN BOTH GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS. IF NEED BE, THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO HAPPEN. AFTER I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL ALSO CALL FOR A SUMMIT WITH OUR NATO ALLIES, AND A SEPARATE SUMMIT WITH OUR ASIAN ALLIES. IN THESE SUMMITS, WE WILL NOT ONLY DISCUSS A REBALANCING OF FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS, BUT TAKE A FRESH LOOK AT HOW WE CAN ADOPT NEW STRATEGIES FOR TACKLING OUR COMMON CHALLENGES. FOR INSTANCE, WE WILL DISCUSS HOW WE CAN UPGRADE NATO'S OUTDATED MISSION AND STRUCTURE, GROWN OUT OF THE COLD WAR, TO CONFRONT OUR SHARED CHALLENGES, INCLUDING MIGRATION AND ISLAMIC TERRORISM.   I WILL NOT HESITATE TO DEPLOY MILITARY FORCE, WHEN THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE. BUT IF AMERICA FIGHTS, IT MUST ONLY FIGHT TO  I WILL NEVER SENT OUR FINEST INTO BATTLE UNLESS NECESSARY, AND I MEAN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, AND WILL ONLY DO SO IF WE HAVE A PLAN FOR VICTORY WITH A CAPITAL V.   OUR GOAL IS PEACE AND PROSPERITY, NOT WAR AND DESTRUCTION. THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS IS THROUGH A DISCIPLINED, DELIBERATE AND CONSISTENT FOREIGN POLICY. WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SECRETARY CLINTON WE'VE HAD THE EXACT OPPOSITE - A RECKLESS, RUDDERLESS AND AIMLESS FOREIGN POLICY, ONE THAT HAS BLAZED THE PATH OF DESTRUCTION IN ITS WAKE. AFTER LOSING THOUSANDS OF LIVES AND SPENDING TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS, WE ARE IN FAR WORSE SHAPE IN THE MIDDLE EAST THAN EVER, EVER BEFORE.  I CHALLENGE ANYONE TO EXPLAIN THE STRATEGIC FOREIGN POLICY VISION OF OBAMA/CLINTON. IT HAS BEEN A COMPLETE AND TOTAL DISASTER. I WILL ALSO BE PREPARED TO DEPLOY AMERICA'S ECONOMIC RESOURCES. FINANCIAL LEVERAGE AND SANCTIONS CAN BE VERY, VERY PERSUASIVE, BUT WE NEED TO USE THEM SELECTIVELY AND WITH TOTAL DETERMINATION. OUR POWER WILL BE USED IF OTHERS DO NOT PLAY BY THE RULES. IN OTHER WORDS, IF THEY DO NOT TREAT US FAIRLY. OUR FRIENDS AND ENEMIES MUST KNOW THAT IF I DRAW A LINE IN THE SAND, I WILL ENFORCE THAT LINE IN THE SAND. BELIEVE ME.   HOWEVER, UNLIKE OTHER CANDIDATES FOR THE PRESIDENCY, WAR AND AGGRESSION WILL NOT BE MY FIRST INSTINCT. YOU CANNOT HAVE A FOREIGN POLICY WITHOUT DIPLOMACY. A SUPERPOWER UNDERSTANDS THAT CAUTION AND RESTRAINT ARE REALLY TRULY SIGNS OF STRENGTH. ALTHOUGH NOT IN GOVERNMENT SERVICE, I WAS TOTALLY AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ, VERY PROUDLY, SAYING FOR MANY YEARS THAT IT WOULD DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST. SADLY, I WAS CORRECT, AND THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARY HAS BEEN HAS -- HAS BEEN IRAN, WHO IS SYSTEMATICALLY TAKING OVER IRAQ AND GAINING ACCESS TO THEIR VERY RICH OIL RESERVES, SOMETHING IT HAS WANTED TO DO FOR DECADES. AND NOW, TO TOP IT OFF, WE HAVE ISIS. MY GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH A FOREIGN POLICY THAT WILL ENDURE FOR SEVERAL GENERATIONS. THAT'S WHY I ALSO LOOK AND HAVE TO LOOK FOR TALENTED EXPERTS WITH APPROACHES AND PRACTICAL IDEAS, RATHER THAN SURROUNDING MYSELF WITH THOSE WHO HAVE PERFECT RESUMES BUT VERY LITTLE TO BRAG ABOUT EXCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR A LONG HISTORY OF FAILED POLICIES AND CONTINUED LOSSES AT WAR. WE HAVE TO LOOK TO NEW PEOPLE.   WE HAVE TO LOOK TO NEW PEOPLE BECAUSE MANY OF THE OLD PEOPLE FRANKLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING, EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY LOOK AWFULLY GOOD WRITING IN ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"" OR BEING WATCHED ON TELEVISION. FINALLY, I WILL WORK WITH OUR ALLIES TO REINVIGORATE WESTERN VALUES AND INSTITUTIONS. INSTEAD OF TRYING TO SPREAD UNIVERSAL VALUES THAT NOT EVERYBODY SHARES OR WANTS, WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT STRENGTHENING AND PROMOTING WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND ITS ACCOMPLISHMENTS WILL DO MORE TO INSPIRE POSITIVE REFORMS AROUND THE WORLD THAN MILITARY INTERVENTIONS.   THESE ARE MY GOALS AS PRESIDENT. I WILL SEEK A FOREIGN POLICY THAT ALL AMERICANS, WHATEVER THEIR PARTY, CAN SUPPORT, SO IMPORTANT, AND WHICH OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES WILL RESPECT AND TOTALLY WELCOME. THE WORLD MUST KNOW THAT WE DO NOT GO ABROAD IN SEARCH OF ENEMIES, THAT WE ARE ALWAYS HAPPY WHEN OLD ENEMIES BECOME FRIENDS AND WHEN OLD FRIENDS BECOME ALLIES, THAT'S WHAT WE WANT.  WE WANT THEM TO BE OUR ALLIES. WE WANT THE WORLD TO BE - WE WANT TO BRING PEACE TO THE WORLD. TOO MUCH DESTRUCTION OUT THERE, TOO MANY DESTRUCTIVE WEAPONS. THE POWER OF WEAPONRY IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TODAY IN THE WORLD. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, AMERICANS MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR COUNTRY AND ITS LEADERSHIP. AGAIN, MANY AMERICANS MUST WONDER WHY WE OUR POLITICIANS SEEM MORE INTERESTED IN DEFENDING THE BORDERS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAN IN DEFENDING THEIR OWN. AMERICANS --   AMERICANS MUST KNOW THAT WE'RE PUTTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FIRST AGAIN ON TRADE.   SO TRUE. ON TRADE, ON IMMIGRATION, ON FOREIGN POLICY. THE JOBS, INCOMES AND SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER WILL ALWAYS BE MY FIRST PRIORITY.   NO COUNTRY HAS EVER PROSPERED THAT FAILED TO PUT ITS OWN INTERESTS FIRST. BOTH OUR FRIENDS AND OUR ENEMIES PUT THEIR COUNTRIES ABOVE OURS AND WE, WHILE BEING FAIR TO THEM, MUST START DOING THE SAME. WE WILL NO LONGER SURRENDER THIS COUNTRY OR ITS PEOPLE TO THE FALSE SONG OF GLOBALISM. THE NATION-STATE REMAINS THE TRUE FOUNDATION FOR HAPPINESS AND HARMONY. I AM SKEPTICAL OF INTERNATIONAL UNIONS THAT TIE US UP AND BRING AMERICA DOWN AND WILL NEVER ENTER.   AND UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, WE WILL NEVER ENTER AMERICA INTO ANY AGREEMENT THAT REDUCES OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL OUR OWN AFFAIRS.   NAFTA, AS AN EXAMPLE, HAS BEEN A TOTAL DISASTER FOR THE UNITED STATES AND HAS EMPTIED OUR STATES - LITERALLY, EMPTIED OUR STATES OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND OUR JOBS. AND I'VE JUST GOTTEN TO SEE IT.  I'VE TOURED PENNSYLVANIA. I'VE TOURED NEW YORK. I'VE TOURED SO MANY OF THE STATES.  THEY HAVE BEEN CLEANED OUT. THEIR MANUFACTURING IS GONE. NEVER AGAIN, ONLY THE REVERSE - AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS STRONGLY - NEVER AGAIN, ONLY THE REVERSE WILL HAPPEN. WE WILL KEEP OUR JOBS AND BRING IN NEW ONES. THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE COMPANIES THAT LEAVE THE UNITED STATES ONLY TO EXPLOIT IT LATER. THEY FIRE THE PEOPLE. THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES. THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE COMPANIES. NEVER AGAIN. UNDER A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, NO AMERICAN CITIZEN WILL EVER AGAIN FEEL THAT THEIR NEEDS COME SECOND TO THE CITIZENS OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY.   I WILL VIEW AS PRESIDENT THE WORLD THROUGH THE CLEAR LENS OF AMERICAN INTERESTS. I WILL BE AMERICA'S GREATEST DEFENDER AND MOST LOYAL CHAMPION. WE WILL NOT APOLOGIZE FOR BECOMING SUCCESSFUL AGAIN, BUT WILL INSTEAD EMBRACE THE UNIQUE HERITAGE THAT MAKES US WHO WE ARE. THE WORLD IS MOST PEACEFUL AND MOST PROSPEROUS WHEN AMERICA IS STRONGEST. AMERICA WILL CONTINUE AND CONTINUE FOREVER TO PLAY THE ROLE OF PEACEMAKER. WE WILL ALWAYS HELP SAVE LIVES AND INDEED HUMANITY ITSELF, BUT TO PLAY THE ROLE, WE MUST MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN.   AND ALWAYS - ALWAYS, ALWAYS, WE MUST MAKE, AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM EVERY ANGLE, AND WE HAVE NO CHOICE, WE MUST MAKE AMERICA RESPECTED AGAIN. WE MUST MAKE AMERICA TRULY WEALTHY AGAIN. AND WE MUST - WE HAVE TO AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AND IF WE DO THAT - AND IF WE DO THAT, PERHAPS THIS CENTURY CAN BE THE MOST PEACEFUL AND PROSPEROUS THE WORLD HAS EVER, EVER KNOWN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY.  I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU.   THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.   THANK YOU.    ",Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Remarks on Foreign Policy

I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY. THIS IS A BIGGER WIN THAN WE EXPECTED. ALL FIVE.  NOT ONLY IS IT ALL FIVE, IT'S ALL FIVE WHETHER IT IS 60, OR JUST ABOUT 60. ONE AT 66 AND 67. I SAY THIS ALL THE TIME TO THE PUNDITS, THERE ARE THREE PEOPLE. WHEN YOU CRACK 60, AS WE DID LAST WEEK WITH OUR GREAT CITY, WHEN YOU CRACK 60 WITH THREE PEOPLE THAT IS HARD TO DO. CHRIS CAN TELL YOU IF YOU CRACK 60 WITH TWO PEOPLE THAT IS CALLED A MASSIVE LANDSLIDE. BUT WE HAVE THREE. SOME STRANGE THINGS HAVE HAPPENED. IT WAS VERY STRANGE WHEN I WATCH THIS GROUP GET TOGETHER. IT WAS A STRANGE MOMENTS. I SAID I THINK THAT IS A GREAT AND. IT SHOWS FAILING CAMPAIGN. REALLY IT'S COLLUSION. POLITICS FROM YOUR A LOT TO GET AWAY WITH IT. I THOUGHT IT WAS A WEEK SIGNAL. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NEED SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN THAT.     WE'LL BE GOING TO INDIANA. IT IS A GREAT STAY. I HAVE MANY FRIENDS THERE. THE GREAT BOBBY KNIGHT, I HAVE A FRIEND THERE.  BOBBY IS AN AMAZING GUY. HE IS TOUGH, HE IS SHARP, AND HE WINS. HE KNOWS HOW TO WIN. THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA LOVE HIM. BOBBY HAS ENDORSED ME. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO SPEND TOMORROW NIGHT AND THE NEXT TODAY WITH HIM. THAT IS CALLED THE GOLD STANDARD. BOBBY KNIGHT HAS TO BE THE GOLD STANDARD FOR INDIANA. SO MANY OTHERS THAT HAVE ENDORSED US. WE WILL BE SPENDING NUMEROUS DAYS IN INDIANA. IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING SPECIAL. I WANT TO THANK THE MEDIA. THE MEDIA HAS COVERED ME VERY FAIRLY FOR THE LAST 2 HOURS.   NO, THEY HAVE BEEN VERY FAIR OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS. IT HAS BEEN AMAZING. THE CROWDS HAVE BEEN RECORD-SETTING. BIGGER THAN BERNIE. HE IS SECOND, I HAVE TO SAY. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TREATED BERNIE BERNIE VERY BADLY. FRANKLY, I THINK YOU SHOULD RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT. -- HE SHOULD RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT. I THINK THEY TREATED HIM VERY BADLY. THE SYSTEM IS A BAD SYSTEM. YOU LOOK AT WHAT GOES ON. THE BEST WAY TO BEAT THE SYSTEM IS HAVING THINGS LIKE THIS, WHERE YOU GET RECORD-SETTING VOTES, RECORD-SETTING DELEGATES.  I USE THE ANALOGY OF THE BOXER. WHEN THE BOXER KNOCKS OUT THE OTHER, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT AROUND FOR A DECISION. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK IN NEW YORK. THAT IS WHAT IS BEEN HAPPENING THROUGHOUT. WE HAVE MILLIONS MORE VOTES -- MILLIONS MORE THAN CRUZ. MILLIONS MORE VOTES THAN KAS ICH. KASICH NOW, I GUESS HE WAS 1 IN 41. NOW HE IS 1 IN 46. WHY IS HE HERE? DR. BEN CARSON DID MUCH BETTER. HE COULD'VE HUNG AROUND AND ON VERY WELL. IF YOU LOOK, CHRIS CHRISTIE DID MUCH BETTER. IF YOU LOOK, MARCO RUBIO DID MUCH BETTER.  IN FACT, MARCO RUBIO RIGHT NOW HAS MORE DELEGATES THAN KASICH. ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS HANG AROUND. IT'S LIKE A SPOILED PERSON THAT JUST SAYS, I'M JUST STATING FOR WHATEVER REASON. KASICH, HAS SOON AS HE GETS HIT WITH THE FIRST NEGATIVE AD -- HE'S HAD NONE -- BING, THAT IS THE END OF THAT. THAT IS ALL HE CAN SAY. WE CAME UP EVEN AGAINST HILLARY. WE WILL BEAT HER SO EASILY.  REMEMBER THIS.  I WAS NOT GOING TO RUN, ACCORDING TO EVERYBODY, AND I READ. I WAS NOT GOING TO SIGN YOUR LIFE AWAY, AND I SIGNED IT. EVERYBODY SAID, WOW. AND WE PUT IN THE FINANCIALS. THEY WERE PHENOMENAL, A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS EVENING, FOR BETTER THAN PEOPLE EVEN THOUGHT. A GREAT COMPANY. WITH THE HELP OF MY SONS AND DAUGHTERS -- WITH THE HOPE OF MY FAMILY, FRANKLY. WE BUILT A GREAT COMPANY.  EVERYBODY SAID AGAIN, WELL, SHE'S JUST GOING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME FOR A COUPLE WEEKS, HE'S ENJOYING IT. VERY SHORTLY WE WENT TO NUMBER ONE. WE HAVE BEEN THERE EVER SINCE. HUNDREDS MORE DELEGATES. I THINK THIS MIGHT BE THE BIGGEST OF THEM ALL. IN NEW YORK, ALMOST 62%. FOUR BETTER THAN WHAT HAD PEOPLE THOUGHT. THEY SAID, IF YOU CAN BREAK 50, WITH THREE PEOPLE, IT'S HARD TO DO THAT. WE HAD ALMOST 62%.  LAST WEEK WE HAD 95 DELEGATES IN NEW YORK STATE. WE PICKED UP ALMOST EVERY OVAL -- EVERY ONE OF THEM. THIS ONE IS A DIVERSE VICTORY. RHODE ISLAND, MARYLAND, CONNECTICUT -- AND CIVILIAN -- AN PENNSYLVANIAD -- AND EVERY ONE OF THEM WAS CONCLUSIVE. EVERY STATE IS SO DIFFERENT. I THINK ONE OF THE GREATS, WHEN YOU LOOK AT 50% IN MASSACHUSETTS AND ALMOST 50% IN ALABAMA. THAT IS PRETTY DIFFERENT. BUT ALL ACROSS THE BOARD. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO WELL IN WASHINGTON STATE. I THINK WE WILL DO AMAZINGLY WELL IN OREGON. EVERY PLACE WE ARE GOING TO. WE ARE GOING TO BE FIGHTING HARD. NEW MEXICO WE WILL BE FIGHTING REALLY HARD. GOVERNOR KASICH AND SENATOR CRUZ HAVE REALLY HURT THEMSELVES WITH A FAULTY DEAL THAT WAS DEFAULTED ON BEFORE THE EVEN STARTED. KASICH SAID, WHAT DO YOU MEAN, AREN'T THEY GOING TO VOTE FOR ME IN INDIANA? I THOUGHT THEY JUST MADE THAT DEAL. POLITICIANS, ALL TALK, NO ACTION, THEY CAN'T GET IT DONE, AND THEY CERTAINLY CAN'T STRAIGHTEN OUT OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO BRING BACK JOBS, TAKE CARE OF OUR MILITARY, SO MANY THINGS.  TO ME, ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST 2 WEEKS -- I HAVE TRAVELED NEW YORK STATE, I WENT TO POUGHKEEPSIE, ROME, NEW YORK OUR ROME. THERE IS ANOTHER ROMAN OUT THERE SOMEPLACE. -- ROME OUT THERE SOMEPLACE. WE WENT TO THE ISLAND, BETHPAGE -- EVERY PLACE WE WENT -- MANUFACTURING DOWN 40% AND EVEN MORE. WE GO TO PENNSYLVANIA AND WE SEE THE SAME THING. YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH STEEL AND OTHER INDUSTRIES. I GET STATISTICIANS TO GIVE ME NUMBERS. BEFORE I LEAVE, GIVE ME THE NUMBERS. EVERY SINGLE PLACE IG O IS A DISASTER. MANUFACTURING DOWN 40-45-60 5% SOMETIMES IN A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME. OUR JOBS ARE BEING SUCKED AWAY FROM OUR COUNTRY AND WE AREN'T GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN ANYMORE. YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DO THAT. WHEN COMPANIES WANT TO LEAVE THIS COUNTRY, OUR GREAT COUNTRY, AND WANT TO LAY OFF ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE HELPED BUILD THE COUNTRY, THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE COMPANY TO PAY. WHEN THEY THINK THEY WILL MAKE THEIR PRODUCT AND SEND IT IN, NO TAXES THROUGH A WEEK BORDER, WHICH WILL BE -- WEAK BORDER, WHICH WILL BE VERY STRONG BY THE WAY. REMEMBER THAT I SAID IT.  WHEN I THINK WE ARE GOING TO SEND THEIR PRODUCT THROUGH THIS WEAK QUARTER AND PAY NO TAX AND HAVE NO CONSEQUENCES FOR WHAT THEY DID, IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPENTHAT WAY. WHEN WE DO THAT, ALL OF A SUDDEN LEBANESE ARE GOING TO SAY, I'M STAYING IN SYRACUSE AND PENNSYLVANIA, I'M STAYING IN MARYLAND. THE PEOPLE OF MARYLAND HAVE BEEN SO INCREDIBLE. WE HAD RALLIES IN MARYLAND AND PENNSYLVANIA THAT WERE ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE. YESTERDAY IN PENNSYLVANIA, WE WERE IN AN ARENA THAT WAS LIKE MADISON SQUARE GARDEN. THEY TURNED AWAY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. UNFORTUNATELY THE PRESS NEVER REPORTS IT. THEY ALWAYS SHOW MY FACE. DOES ANYBODY WANT TO SHOW THIS ARENA THAT HAS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN IT? THAT'S OK BECAUSE I WILL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU. WE'LL HAVE OUR COUNTRY BACK, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. FOR THE 5 STATES, I AM SO HONORED. THIS WAS TO ME OUR BIGGEST NIGHT.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL TAKE SOME QUESTIONS.  YEAH, I DON'T KNOW THE FINAL NUMBERS-- FOR THE MOST PART, IT HAS BEEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I CONSIDER MYSELF THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE.   SENATOR CRUZ AND GOVERNOR KASICH SHOULD REALLY GET OUT OF THE RACE. THEY HAVE TO VICTORY. -- HAVE NO PATH TO VICTORY. THEY SHOULD GET OUT OF THE RACE AND HE WILL THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. -- AND HEAL THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. INA UNIFIER. -- I AM A UNIFIER. WE HAVE PEOPLE ASKING THIS PARTY . WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SUCH UNITY. SOME HAVE GONE TOO FAR OVER THE EDGE. WE ARE GOING TO BEAT HILLARY CLINTON.   WE ARE LEADING BY SO MUCH. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HIT THE NUMBERS PRETTY EASILY.   WITH PENNSYLVANIA, WE HAD A MASSIVE VICTORY, ABOVE 60%. PENNSYLVANIA HAS BEEN AMAZING.  WE'VE GOT 17 DELEGATES OUTRIGHT. YOU HAVE 54 OR SO THAT ARE UP FOR GRABS. THE ONE THING DIFFERENT WITH PENNSYLVANIA -- I HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT FOR YEARS -- THE WINNER OF PENNSYLVANIA, THERE IS A MORAL OBLIGATION, AT LEAST IN THE FIRST ROUND, TO SUPPORT THE PERSON THAT WON. WE WON BIG. YOU HAVE THE THREE PEOPLE. WHEN YOU HAVE 3 PEOPLE, TO GET 60%, THAT'S ALMOST UNHEARD OF. GETTING 60% WITH 2 PEOPLE, THAT'S STILL A REALLY BIG VICTORY. WE HAVE A GREAT REPUBLICAN LEADER AND YOU HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION. ALL I CARE ABOUT IS THE FIRST ROUND. YOU HEAR THAT CRUZ GROWING AROUND BITING PEOPLE DINNER, GETTING THEM INTO HOTEL ROOMS. HE'S LOOKING FOR THE SECOND AND THIRD AND FOURTH. I'M NOT TOO INTERESTED IN THAT. WE ARE GOING TO WIN ON THE FIRST. I'M NOT LOOKING TO GO TO THE SECOND AND FOURTH. THE TRUTH IS, EVEN IF IT WENT THERE, CAN YOU IMAGINE-- IN CALIFORNIA, I THINK WE HIT 50% TODAY. THEY ARE AT 18%, 60% -- THERE IS A MASSIVE DIFFERENCE. --18%, 16%. CALIFORNIA IS HOME OF AREA -- HOME OF CARRIER AIR-CONDITIONING, WHICH IS LEAVING FOR MEXICO. I AM SAYING THAT WON'T HAPPEN IF I'M PRESIDENT. CARRIER WILL NOT BE LEAVING INDIANA IF I'M PRESIDENT. I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME. THE UNFAIR THING THAT PUNDITS NEVER REPORT, WHEN I BEGAN THE PROCESS, VERY CAPABLE PEOPLE WITH THESE PEOPLE -- 17, A RECORD IN HISTORY OF POLITICS. 17 PEOPLE. I START WINNING. I'LL WIN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND I GET 32%. PEOPLE WILL SAY, WHY DID HE GET 32%? YOU CAN'T GET 50% WHEN YOU HAVE 16 PEOPLE. I GO TO SOUTH CAROLINA. WE HAVE A MASSIVE VICTORY. THAT WAS CRUZ'  STRONGHOLD. EXCEPT I WON IT IN A LANDSLIDE BECAUSE OF THE EVANGELICALS THAT BACK TO ME. THEY HAVE BEEN UNBELIEVABLE. I WON THERE. WE HAD 12-14, MANY PEOPLE. WE GOT A LOT. WE WENT TO NEVADA. ALABAMA, WITH ALL THE PEOPLE WE HAD, WE ALMOST HAD TO PERCENT. MASSACHUSETTS, WE ALMOST GOT 50%. I WAS WATCHING TONIGHT, THE PUNDITS NEVER TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THESE EARLY STATES 3 IS UNFIAR. -- IS UNFAIR. THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIGHTING ONE PERSON AND FIGHTING TWO PEOPLE IN TERMS OF PERCENTAGES. WHENH YOU TALK ABOUT THE 1237 NUMBER, THE FIRST 70%, WE HAD 16-17 PEOPLE TO 10, TO 8, TO0 6, TO 5, TO 4, AND NOW WE ARE AT 3. IT'S REALLY UNFAIR. I MEAN, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GOOD AT MATH. NOBODY EVER DISCUSSES THAT. WHEN I WATCH TELEVISION -- WHETHER IT'S CNN, FOX -- THEY NEVER TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE. IF YOU'VE GOT A 32 OR 38%, AND YOU HAVE 7 PEOPLE RUNNING, THAT'S LIKE 75%. I'M HONORED TO HAVE HIT OVER 60% IN VIRTUALLY EVERY RACE WITH ONLY THREE PEOPLE LEFT.  I DID NOT WANT TO BORE YOU WITH THAT LONG -- I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S NEVER DISCUSSED ON TELEVISION.  HE IS WASTING HIS TIME. LIST OF RUNNING MATES? I HEARD HE HAD A NEWS CONFERENCE TONIGHT, AND A NEWS CONFERENCE WAS FOR THE PURPOSE THAT IS GETTING OUT OF THE RACE. THAT IS WHAT I THOUGHT. AND INSTEAD JUST MORE TALK. NO, I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT. I'M NOT DOING THAT. WE'RE GOING TO SET UP A COMMITTEE IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE. I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW. I THINK CHRIS CHRISTIE IS FANTASTIC.   NO, I AM ME. HE WILL BE PRESIDENTIAL, NOT ESSENTIAL -- IT'S EASY TO BE PRESIDENTIAL. I AM NOT PLAYING A PART. LOOK, I STARTED OFF IT 17, AND IN WINNING, IT IS OVER. AS FAR AS IT CAN CONCERN, IT'S OVER. WHY WOULD I CHANGE? YOU HAVE A FOOTBALL TEAM AND YOU ARE WINNING AND YOU GET TO THE SUPER BOWL, YOU DON'T CHANGE YOUR QUARTERBACK. SO I'M NOT CHANGING. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO GREAT IN THE GENERAL. I MAY ACT DIFFERENTLYM BUT MY THOUGHT PROCESS IS THE SAME. IF I SPEAK TO GROUP OF 10 PEOPLE IN A CONFERENCE ROOM, I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK THE SAME WAY I SPOKE IN PENNSYLVANIA YESTERDAY TO 25,000 PEOPLE. BUT I WILL BE SAYING SIMILAR THINGS.  I'M DOING A FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH, YES. WHICH I LOOK FORWARD TO.  IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION. I'VE HAD MANY PEOPLE WRITE IN, TWEET IN, CALL IN -- PLEASE DON'T CHANGE, STATE THE WAY YOU ARE! LOOK, I'M NOT CHANGING. I WENT TO THE BEST SCHOOLS. I AM GOING TO REPRESENT OUR PERSON WITH DIGNITY AND VERY WELL. BUT I DO WANT TO CHANGE MY PERSONALITY.  IT GOT ME HERE. SOMEBODY SAID, IF YOU CHANGE YOU WOULD BE WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW. WE BEAT A LOT OF PEOPLE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING WHAT HAPPENED DARLING, WHY ARE WE SITTING HERE WATCHING TELEVISION? WHEN I ANNOUNCED, THERE WERE MANY FAVORITES GOING TO WIN. ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE RAISED OVER $100 MILLION IN A PAC, HAVE A LOT OF MONEY PERSONALLY. OTHERS HAD BIG ADVANTAGES, GOVERNORS OF MAJOR STATES, ETC. THEY WERE ALL GOING TO DO GREAT. BUT ONE AFTER ANOTHER, AND HERE WE STAND, WITH 5 VICTORIES OVER 60%.  I CALL HER CROOKED HILLARY. SHE WOULD BE A HORRIBLE PRESIDENT, SHE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT JOB CREATION. HER HUSBAND SIGNED NAFTA WHICH DESTROYED TO THIS COUNTRY ECONOMICALLY. LOOK AT NEW ENGLAND, PENNSYLVANIA, NAFTA WAS A DISASTER. HER HUSBAND SIGNED IT. IT WAS A DISASTER FOR THE COUNTRY. HILLARY WILL BE HORRIBLE, ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. SHE WILL BE TERRIBLE ON JOBS. SHE DOES NOTHING ABOUT JOBS EXCEPT JOBS FOR HERSELF.  WHEN IT CAME TO ANSWERING THE PHONE AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING, SHE WAS SLEEPING. SHE WASN'T WITH BENGHAZI. LOOK AT SYRIA, SO MANY OTHER THINGS. SHE WILL NOT BE A GOOD PRESIDENT. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH, THE STAMINA. I KNOW ABOUT DEALING WITH CHINA. I'VE MADE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DEALING WITH CHINA. CHINA CAN BE DEALT WITH AND YOU CAN GET ALONG WITH THEM. HILLARY DOES NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH OR THE STAMINA TO DEAL WITH CHINA OR OTHER THINGS. PUT BOTTOM LINE, ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS OUR COUNTRY HAS HIS PROBLEMS WITH TRADE. CHINA, JAPAN, MEXICO -- SO MANY COUNTRIES RIPPING US LEFT AND RIGHT. THE POLITICIANS CANNOT HANDLE THE PROBLEM. THEY DON'T HAVE THE COMPETENCE TO DO IT. MOST OF THEM ARE PAID OFF THROUGH CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS SO THAT THEY DON'T TOUCH CERTAIN THINGS. WHEN PEOPLE ARE MAKING LESS MONEY IN REAL WAGES THAN THEY WERE 18 YEARS AGO, AND SOME PEOPLE SAY WOW, HE HAD A BIG CROWD. THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG REASONS. YOU HAVE PEOPLE MAKING LESS MONEY TODAY, BECAUSE YOU SEE EVERY STAT -- LESS MONEY TODAY THAN THEY MADE 18 YEARS AGO. AND IN SOME CASES, THEY ARE WORKING 2 JOBS. SO THEY ARE GETTING OLDER AND WORKING HARDER. IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY.  NO, NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT. I AM NOT A HATEFUL PERSON. I MCPHERSON THAT LETS PEOPLE.  -- AM A PERSON THAT LOVES PEOPLE. THAT'S THE THEME. SHE IS GOING WITH THAT. I WILL DO FAR MORE FOR WOMEN THAN HILLARY CLINTON LEVERAGING. -- CLINTON WILL EVERY DO. SHE WILL NOT BE GOOD WITH THE MILITARY. SHE WILL NOT BE GOOD AT PROTECTING OUR COUNTRY. SHE HAS HAD HER SHOT. SHE RAISED HER HAND WHEN IT CAME TO IRAQ, AND SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE VOTED. TAKE A LOOK AT THE THINGS BERNIE SANDERS WAS SAYING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON. HE SAID SHE IS NOT QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT. BUT HE SAID SOMETHING ELSE. YOU AHVE TO RUN AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. BUT HE SAID SOME THINGS ABOUT HER THAT WERE SO INCREDIBLE. AND SO INCREDIBLY BAD. IS A GREAT LEVEL OF HATRED. HE HAS BEEN TELLING THE TRUTH. I THINK BERNIE SANDERS SHOULD RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT. I THINK HE WILL DO GREAT.  I THINK THE PARTY IS SEEING ME THAT WAY. I'M GETTING CALLS THAT YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE. I CAN EVEN KNOW HOW THEY CAN DO IT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE SAID SUCH HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT ME. NOW THEY WANT TO JOIN THE TEAM. CHRIS CAN TELL YOU THAT. BEN CARSON CAN TELL YOU THAT. OTHER PEOPLE CAN TELL YOU THAT. COREY, ALL CAN TELL YOU. -- PAUL CAN TELL YOU. I ACTUALLY SAY, HOW CAN YOU DO THIS? AND THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM. NAMES THAT YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. NAMES THAT YOU INTERVIEW AND SAY OH, TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP. AND HOW THEY WANT TO JOIN THE TEAM. A LOT OF THEM WILL BE COMING OUT SOON.  TOMORROW IS GOING TO BE INTERESTING. SOME OF MY VIEWS ON FOREIGN POLICY AND DEFENSE, AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS. AND PART OF IT IS THE ECONOMICS. I WAS ASKED THE QUESTION RECENTLY BY WOLF BLITZER ON CNN, AND HE TALKED ABOUT NATO. AT FIRST, PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE IT. THEY SAID, TRUMP IS RIGHT. I SAID IT WAS OBSOLETE AND TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE GETTING A FREE RIDE. WE ARE FUNDING 72-73% OF NATO. MANY OF THESE COUNTRIES ARE JUST TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES. YOU HAVE TO PAY UP. WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY WITH $19 TRILLION IN DEBT. PART OF WHAT I'M SAYING -- WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND OUR ALLIES, BUT OUR ALLIES CAN NO LONGER BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS COUNTRY. THIS ISN'T 40 YEARS OR 20 YEARS AGO, THIS IS NOW.WE HAVE TO REBUILD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, OUR COUNTRY, WE HAVE TO GET RID OF ISIS AND FAST. OUR MILITARY IS TOTALLY DEPLETED. IT'S GOING TO BE THE CHEAPEST THING WE CAN DO. A LOT OF GREAT THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. >>   NO NO, YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO HEAR DIFFERENT THINGS. I'LL NEVER CHANGE ONE THING. YOU KNOW WHAT I WILL NEVER CHANGE? ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.""  NO, IS NOT GOING TO BE THE TRUMP A DOCTRINE. -- TRUMP DOCTRINE.IN LIFE YOU HAVE TO HAVE, ITS ABILITY. YOU MAY SAY ONE THING AND, THE FOLLOWING YEAR YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT, BECAUSE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DIFFERENT. I HAVE FOLLOWED PEOPLE FOR YEARS. I HAVE FRIENDS, MANY OF THEM ENDORSING ME, MANY GREAT BUSINESS PEOPLE. YOU HAVE TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY. YOU CAN'T SAY, THIS IS MY DOCTRINE AND I WON'T MOVE. THE WORLD CHANGES, LEADERS CHANGE.LOTS OF THINGS HAPPEN . YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.  WE DON'T HAVE A CEILING. DO YOU KNOW WHAT OUR CEILING IS? I THINK IT'S 100%.  AGAIN, THE CEILING WAS ALWAYS SO UNFAIR. I WANT TO DO IT BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT. THE CEILING, THEY KEPT SAYING, HE DOESN'T HIT 50%. HOW DO YOU HIT 50% WHEN YOU HAVE 16 PEOPLE IN A RACE? YOU CAN'T DO IT. NO NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, I HAVE MANY PEOPLE RUNNING. I THINK I'M GOING TO WIN NEW YORK. KNOW OF THE REPUBLICAN CAN SAY IT. CONSERVATIVE VOTERS? DID YOU SEE THE POLLS COMING OUT TONIGHT? THE MOST CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE INTO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, TONIGHT, BACK DONALD TRUMP.  THAT IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST QUESTION I AM GETTING -- STUDENT AT. WE ARE GOING TO WORK ON THAT. --STUDENT DEBT. STUDENTS HAVE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT. -- WITH DEBT. THEY GO TO A COULD COLLEGE, THEY ARE CHOKING ON DEBT. THEY GET GOOD MARKS, THEY WORKING HARD, AND THEY CAN'T GET A JOB. I AM GOING TO DRINK JOBS BACK -- BRINGS JOBS BACK TO THIS COUNTRY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN.  THAT IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. WE HAVE A LOT OF CONTRAST IN TERMS OF JOBS, IN TERMS OF HOW I WOULD HANDLE WALL STREET. HILLARY CLINTON IS FUNDED BY WALL STREET, FOLKS. SHE WON'T GET THE NOMINATION UNLESS SHE GETS INDICTED WITH THESE E-MAILS. YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS TO SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE. THEY WENT THROUGH HELL, THEIR LIVES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED FOR DOING LESS THAN WHAT HILLARY CLINTON DID. WHAT YOU DID IS AN OUTRAGE. IT IS ABSOLUTE CRIMINAL OUTRAGE. FOR HER TO BE ABLE TO RUN AS A DEMOCRAT, MAYBE THAT IS WHY BERNIE SANDERS ISN'T FINISHED. THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SAY THAT IS IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO HER. SHE IS BEING PROTECTED BY THE DEMOCRATS. I SEE IT, AND WHETHER I READ ABOUT IT IN THE PAPERS OR WATCH IT WITH LEGAL EXPERTS OR TV, VIRTUALLY EVERY ONE OF THEM SAYS WHAT SHE DID IS A CRIMINAL ACT AND A VERY DANGEROUS THING FOR OUR COUNTRY. YET HERE SHE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I THINK HILLARY IS A FLAWED CANDIDATE. I THINK SHE'S GOING TO BE EASY TO BEAT. I THINK SHE'S GOING TO BE MUCH EASIER TO BEAT THAN MOST OF THE 16 PEOPLE THAT I COMPETED WITH JUST RECENTLY.   TO ME, ALWAYS THE NUMBER ONE SECURITY THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES IS NUCLEAR. THAT SI OUR BIGGEST THREAT. IS OUR BIGGEST RISK. THE POWER OF WEAPONRY. WE HAVE TO BE UNBELIEVABLY CAREFUL. PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THE BIGGEST THREAT IS GLOBAL WARMING. GIVE ME A BREAK. THE BIGGEST THREAT TO OUR COUNTRY IS NUCLEAR. WE CANNOT LET IRAN GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON.  WE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING WHERE WE WILL HAVE A REAL PARTNERSHIP WITH CHINA. CHINA HAS REBUILD ITSELF BY MAKING A FORTUNE OVER US. CHINA HAS TREMENDOUS POWER OVER NORTH KOREA. WE HAVE TO BE VERY VIGILANT ON NORTH KOREA. WE CANNOT LET THIS GUY GO MUCH FURTHER. CHINA SHOULD HANDLE THE PROBLEM. THEY CAN HANDLE IT VERY EASILY. THEY SAY THAT THEY CAN, BUT THEY ARE TOYING WITH US. WE HAVE A LOT OF POWER. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA, WITH PUTIN AND RUSSIA. CHINA HAS A LOT OF POWER OVER NORTH KOREA. THEY JUST REFUSE TO USE IT, AND THEY REFUSE TO TALK ABOUT IT. THEY DON'T RESPECT US OR OUR PRESIDENT AND THEY ARE GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, VERY IMPORTANT TO ME -- NUCLEAR WEAPONRY, THAT IS YOUR SINGLE BIGGEST THREAT IN THE WORLD TODAY. NO, THAT IS A CIVIL CASE. I AM GOING TO WIN THAT EASILY. >>   MY UNFAVORABLES HAVE COME DOWN A LOT OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS. REMEMBER THIS -- I SAW IT ON ALL OF THE CABLE STATIONS, AND A LOT OF THE NETWORKS. I'VE HAD 55,000 NEGATIVE ADS AGAINST ME. WHEN IRAN IN FLORIDA, I HAD 14,000 NEGATIVE ADS. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AND I WON IN A LANDSLIDE. I'VE HAD NEGATIVE ADS ALL THROUGHOUT, AND I WON IN A LANDSLIDE. YOU ALL REPORTED IT. EVEN CARL WOULD AGREE TO THAT. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HURT THE INDUSTRY. LARGELY THE ADS WERE FALSE. I HAD 55,000. JEB SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON NEGATIVE ADS. MOST OF THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THE OREGON. WHEN I AM ONE-ON-ONE WITH HISTORY -- WITH HILLARY, SHE WILL BE MUCH EASIER TO BEAT THASN  I THINK THEY ARE HURTING THE PARTY BECAUSE THEY HAVE ZERO PATH TO VICTORY. WE ARE GOING TO WIN ON THE FIRST BALLOT. WE DON'T LOOK FOR THE DELEGATES ON THE OTHER BALLOTS. LET US ASSUME IT DID GO BEYOND THE FIRST BALLOT, AND LET US ASSUME THAT THE HEAD OF THE RNC, AND TRUMP WAS WHILE SHORT OR 15 DELEGATES SHORT, OR 25 SHORT, BUT 500 MORE THAN CRUZ AND FAR MORE THAN THAT AHEAD OF KASICH. YOU GO TO A SECOND BALLOT. TRUMP, BY THAT TIME, WILL BE 5 MILLION VOTES BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA, AND IN THE END THAT AND OTHER PLACES, TRUMP WILL BE 5 MILLION VOTES AHEAD OF CRUZ. WE WILL BE MUCH MORE THAN 5 MILLION VOTES AHEAD OF KASICH. I CALL KASICH -- NOW I CHANGE IT TO ONE OUT OF 46. I WOULD HAVE WON OHIO HOT I NOT BEEN GIVEN A DIRTY COAL SAYING -- DIRTY POLL. IF I SPENT TWO MORE DAYS IN OHIO, I WOULD HAVE WON IT. I AM THE ONE THAT BROUGHT ALL THESE PEOPLE AND THE PARTY. THAT IS WHAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS UP ALMOST 70% FROM FOUR YEARS AGO.   THOSE PEOPLE, AT A MINIMUM, ARE GOING TO BE VERY UPSET, AND AT A MINIMUM THEY ARE NOT GOING TO VOTE. HOW DO YOU SAY, OK, TRUMP WON BY 5 MILLION VOTES, HE IS FIVE, SIX, HUNDRED DELEGATES MORE THAN CRUZ , AND HE BROUGHT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE INTO THE PARTY, AND EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THE PARTY, WORLD WIDE. HOW HOT, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THE DEMOCRATS ARE DOWN FROM FOUR YEARS AGO. THE REPUBLICANS ARE, 70% UP FROM FOUR YEARS AGO. THAT IS AMAZING. THAT IS NOT BECAUSE OF KASICH CRUZ. THAT IS BECAUSE OF ME. HOW DO YOU SAY TO THEM, WE ARE GOING TO CHOOSE A MAN LOST BY 5 MILLION VOTES AND 500 DELEGATES. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DO THAT. WITH THAT BEING SAID, I INTEND TO GET ENOUGH DELEGATES, BUT THAT IS IT. YES, MA'AM, ONE MORE QUESTION. GO AHEAD.  I WILL SIT WITH MY FEELINGS ON IMMIGRATION. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON IN IMMIGRATION, AND THE RECORD NUMBERS OF PEOPLE RIGHT NOW THAT ARE POURING ACROSS THE BORDERS OF THIS COUNTRY, ITS USE ME. I JUST READ IT. I READ IT IN A LEGITIMATE JOURNAL. WE NEED PROTECTION IN OUR COUNTRY. YOU LOOK AT THE KIND OF CRIME, YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON ECONOMICALLY, WE NEED BORDERS. BY THE WAY, I WANT TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY, BUT I WANT THEM TO COME IN LEGALLY. THEY HAVE TO COME IN THROUGH A PROCESS.   THERE WILL BE ONE MORE.  EXCEEDINGLY SMART -- EXCUSE ME? I THINK THE ONLY CARD SHE HAS IS THE WOMAN'S CARD. SHE HAS NOTHING ELSE GOING. FRANKLY, IF HILLARY CLINTON WERE A MAN, I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD GET 75% OF THE VOTE. THE ONLY THING SHE HAS GOT GOING IS A WOMAN'S CARD, AND WOMEN DON'T LIKE HER. LOOK HOW WELL I DID WITH WOMEN TONIGHT.   LADIES AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE IT.

THANK YOU. OH BOY, OH BOY. THIS IS GREAT. DO WE LOVE DELAWARE? DO WE LOVE IT? YES? WHEN I LEFT THE OFFICE I ASKED FOR A COUPLE OF THINGS. I SAID, NUMBER ONE, I SPENT A FORTUNE IN DELAWARE. NOBODY DOES THAT, RIGHT? IT IS A GREAT PLACE. I SAID TO MY PEOPLE, WE DO A LOT OF BUSINESS IN DELAWARE. THAT MEANS TAXES AND EVERYTHING. HOW MANY ENTITIES DO WE HAVE REGISTERED IN DELAWARE, LIKE COMPANIES? I FIGURED THEY WOULD SAY MAYBE TWO OR THREE. 378. SO WE HAVE 378 ENTITIES REGISTERED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE. MEANING I PAY YOU A LOT OF MONEY. I DON'T FEEL AT ALL GUILTY. I DON'T KNOW. THEY MIGHT BE OFF BY A COUPLE, BUT THAT IS ABOUT IT. THEY HAD ABOUT 12 MINUTES TO GET ME THE ANSWER. IT IS A LOT. GOOD THAT IS GOOD. ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT. IT IS A GREAT PLACE. GREAT PEOPLE. THEY HAVE DONE AN UNBELIEVABLE JOB VERY HELLO, FOLKS. HELLO. THANK YOU. STILL CAN'T BELIEVE, 378. HERE IS THE BAD NEWS. WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO FIX IT. WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT FAST. REAL MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN DELAWARE HAS DECLINED BY MORE THAN $10,000. SINCE 2000. NO GOOD, RIGHT? I'M DOING MY SHARE. DELAWARE LOST 1/3 OF ITS MANUFACTURING JOBS SINCE CHINA ENTER THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION IN 2001. THIS REGION OF THE STATE ALSO LOST 1/3 OF ITS MANUFACTURING JOBS TO CHINA. LYING TED CRUZ SUPPORTS CHINESE CURRENCY CHEATING. THINK OF IT. HE VOTED AGAINST AN AMENDMENT TO TRY AND BLOCK CURRENCY CHEATING BY CHINA AND TED CRUZ VOTED AGAINST IT AND IT IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST 11 THAT CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE AGAINST US FOR DESTROYING OUR BUSINESSES. THIS GUY VOTED AGAINST IT. IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO VOTE AGAINST IT IF YOU LOVE OUR COUNTRY. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? SOMEBODY GOT TO HIM AND SAID WE WANT YOU TO VOTE AGAINST IT BECAUSE SOME COMPANY OR COUNTRY DID NOT WANT IT AND THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE RUNNING FOR OFFICE. WE ARE GOING TO END IT. TERRIBLE I ACTUALLY HAD TO HAVE THAT ONE CHECK. HOW CAN YOU VOTE AGAINST THAT HE VOTED. LYING TED CRUZ. DELAWARE WAS HIT HARD BY CLOSURES OF ITS AUTO MANUFACTURING PLANTS OVER THE YEARS, INCLUDING CHRYSLER AND GM PLANTS. CREWS AND KASICH SUPPORT THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP WHICH WILL ABSOLUTELY KILL THE AUTO INDUSTRY IN THE COUNTRY. I AM AGAINST IT. I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING IT. KASICH VOTED FOR NAFTA, WHICH HAS CLEANED OUR CLOCK FOUR YEARS. TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP IS WORSE THAN THAT. IT IS GOING TO BE WORSE. WE HAVE GOT TO STOP IT. WE HAVE GOT TO STOP IT. OBAMA WANTS IT. IF OBAMA WANTS IT, YOU KNOW IT IS NO GOOD. MAN. I HATE TO DO IT. IT IS SO NEGATIVE, RIGHT? BUT IT DOES NOT MATTER. IF I BECOME PRESIDENT, WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT AROUND. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE GREAT TRADE DEALS. WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR JOB BACK AND KEEP THE JOBS THAT WE HAVE HERE. BELIEVE ME. THE NUMBER OF FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS IN THIS COUNTY HAS INCREASED SIXFOLD. THAT IS A LOT. SINCE 2000. 6000 FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS, YOU HAVE 36,000. WE HAVE TO GET GOING. WE WILL GET IT CHANGED. DELAWARE VOTERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE INTAKE OF SYRIAN REFUGEES. IS THAT UNBELIEVABLE? THE STATE HAS SEEN LARGE INCREASES IN ITS FOREIGN-BORN POPULATION. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM, WHO THEY ARE. THEY ARE TOTALLY UNDOCUMENTED. WE HAVE SEEN A LARGE INTAKE. WITH THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE, WE HAVE SEEN A LARGE INTAKE. REMEMBER WHEN THEY SAID IT WAS 3000, THEN 6000? I SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE A LOT MORE LIKE 200,000. I WAS RIGHT. WE ARE TAKING IN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. WE ALL HAVE HEARTS AND WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THAT, BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THESE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM. THEY HAVE NO DOCUMENTS, TOTALLY UNDOCUMENTED. WE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS IN OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE $19 TRILLION IN DEBT. WE HAVE THE SOUTHERN BORDER WHICH IS LIKE A PIECE OF SWISS CHEESE AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT. WE WILL BUILD THE WALL, YES. WE WILL BUILD THE WALL. BUILD THE WALL. BUILD THE WALL.  WE WILL BUILD IT. WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT? 100%. ARE WE HAVING A GOOD TIME? WE HAVE A GREAT TIME CONSIDERING THE SUBJECT HEADER IS NO GOOD. LOOK AT ALL THOSE HATS. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WHEN WE SAY THAT, YOU KNOW SOMEBODY, A REPORTER -- BY THE WAY, THE WORLD'S MOST DISHONEST PEOPLE BACK THERE. LOOKING ALL THE CAMERAS GOING. THEY ARE DISHONEST. NOT ALL OF THEM, BUT MOST OF THEM. LAST NIGHT, BILL O'REILLY SAID, BECAUSE THERE IS A MOVEMENT, NO MATTER WHERE WE GO, THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE POURING IN. LOOK AT THIS PLACE. THAT IS A LOT OF PEOPLE. BILL O'REILLY ON FOX SAID LAST NIGHT THAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH TRUMP IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST POLITICAL EVENTS THAT HE IS EVER SEEN. I WILL GO A STEP FURTHER. HE ACTUALLY SAID IT IS THE BIGGEST MEDICAL EVENT THAT HE HAS SEEN IN HIS LIFETIME -- BIGGEST POLITICAL EVENT THAT HE HAS SEEN IN HIS LIFETIME. HE IS A PRO AND AN AMAZING GUY, TOUGH AND SMART. HE DOES NOT ALWAYS TREAT ME GREAT, BUT THAT IS OK. SAID THAT BIGGEST POLITICAL EVENT THAT HE IS EVER SEEN IN HIS LIFETIME. I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON THAT IS INCREDIBLE. WE GO TO ALABAMA, WE HAD 35,000 PEOPLE AND WE WON ALABAMA, WE WON ARKANSAS, WE WON FLORIDA, AND WE WON SOUTH CAROLINA. AND WE WON NEW HAMPSHIRE AND WE WON CONNECTICUT AND WE WON SO MUCH. WHY DID WE WIN TWO DAYS AGO WITH RECORD NUMBERS IN NEW YORK? YOU KNOW WHAT IS NICE ABOUT WINNING NEW YORK? REALLY, AND NOT JUST THE FACT THAT IT IS BIG AND WE WON ALMOST EVERY DELEGATE. WE WON BY A MASSIVE AMOUNT. WE HAD 62%. WHEN YOU THINK OF IT, YOU HAVE THREE PEOPLE RUNNING, IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK 50 AND WE GOT 62%. IT REALLY IS. YOU KNOW WHAT IS NICE ABOUT WINNING NEW YORK? THOSE PEOPLE KNOW ME WELL. YOU DON'T KNOW ME AS WELL. YOU JUST TAKE MY MONEY WITH ALL THE TAXES. I HAVE KNOWN DELAWARE FOR A LONG TIME AND IT IS A GREAT PLACE. WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF THE BAD STUFF THAT WE TALK ABOUT HER WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF IT. WE HAVE TO DO THAT ALSO AT A FEDERAL LEVEL. YOU CANNOT ALLOW POLICY THAT ALLOWS CHINA AND MEXICO AND JAPAN AND VIETNAM AND INDIA, YOU CAN'T ALLOW POLICY THAT ALLOWS THESE BUSINESSES TO BE RIPPED OUT OF YOUR STATE LIKE CANDY FROM A BABY. LIKE CANDY FROM A BABY. IT WILL END AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT. WHAT IS NICE ABOUT NEW YORK IS THEY KNOW ME THE BEST. I GREW UP IN NEW YORK AND I HAVE BEEN IN NEW YORK A LONG TIME AND I HAVE BEEN VERY PUBLIC. I HAVE BEEN WELL VETTED. IF I SNEEZE, IT IS A BIG STORY. THEY KNOW ME WELL. TO WIN BY THAT KIND OF A MARGIN IS NOT JUST THE SIZE OF NEW YORK, BUT EVEN A PERSON FROM ANOTHER STATE CALLED ME AND SAID THE NICEST PART, THEY KNOW YOU SO WELL IN NEW YORK, AND FOR YOU TO WIN BY THIS MASSIVE NUMBER, A RECORD-SETTING NUMBER, IS REALLY A GREAT TRIBUTE. I NEVER THOUGHT IT THAT WAY. I JUST WANTED TO GET OVER 50%. GREAT PEOPLE IN NEW YORK. I WENT OVER THE STATE AND I NEW YORK STATE VERY WELL. YOU HAD SYRACUSE AND ROCHESTER, WE WANT TO LONG ISLAND, WE WENT ALL OVER. SUFFOLK COUNTY. IT IS HORRIBLE WHAT IS GOING ON. IT IS THE SAME EVERYWHERE. I ALWAYS ASK FOR THESE THINGS. THIS STUFF. I ASKED FOR IT AND SAY THE STATISTICIANS, THEY GET IT OUT OF BOOKS, GOVERNMENT BOOKS, AND I SAY GIVE ME THE INFORMATION. I HAVE DONE MANY SPEECHES IN MANY PLACES OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS AND IT IS ALWAYS THE SAME. THE MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE BEING STOLEN. OUR JOBS ARE BEING TAKEN. WE ARE LOSING ON EVERY FRONT. THERE IS NOTHING GOOD. OUR COUNTRY DOES NOT WIN ANYMORE. WHETHER IT IS DELAWARE OR WHETHER IT IS SYRACUSE, NEW YORK, OR WHETHER IT IS ALBANY -- WE HAD 21,000 PEOPLE IN ALBANY SHOW UP. INCREDIBLE PEOPLE AND IN A GREAT ARENA. WE HAD 21,000 PEOPLE. WE HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SHOW UP AT EVERY STOP AND IT IS ALWAYS THE SAME. I SAY GET ME THE INFORMATION AND IF THE INFORMATION WAS GOOD, I WOULD LIKE TO READ IT. IT IS ALWAYS THE SAME. THE JOBS ARE BEING STRIPPED. THE FACTORIES ARE CLOSING. YOU RIDE THROUGH SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES AND YOU GO FROM THE AIRPORT TO A VENUE LIKE THIS AND YOU SEE ALL OF THE CLOSURES. YOU CAN SEE IT. A THRIVING PLACE 10 YEARS AGO, 20 YEARS AGO, AND IT HAS BEEN STRIPPED. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN ANYMORE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE THE DUMMIES. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE THE DUMMIES. IT IS TERRIBLE. I EVEN SAID WHEN THEY GAVE ME THE STATISTICS, I SAID, WHAT DO I NEED THEM FOR? I HAVE A GOOD MEMORY. A GREAT MEMORY. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS GET UP AND SAY MANUFACTURING DOWN 30%. IT IS THE SAME THING EVERYWHERE. IN SOME CASES, YOU HAVE TO SAY LOCAL POLITICS AND LOCAL POLITICIANS, BUT THE MEGADEAL IS WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH OUR COUNTRY. OUR LEADERSHIP IS TERRIBLE. OUR LEADERSHIP IS INCOMPETENT. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING. THERE REALLY IS NO LEADERSHIP. YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT, HE GOES TO CUBA AND WATCHES A GAME AND A BIG TRAGEDY HAPPENS, WATCHES THE END OF THE GAME. HE LANDS IN CUBA -- NO. HE LANDS IN CUBA AND THERE'S NOBODY TO GREET HIM. HERE IS THE DIFFERENCE. NO PROBLEM WITH CUBA, BY THE WAY. IT IS TIME TO MAKE A DEAL. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A BETTER DEAL. YOU LAND IN CUBA AND NO ONE IS THERE. IN THE HISTORY OF AIR FORCE ONE, WHICH IS PRETTY LONG, IT IS PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME THE PLANE LANDED WITH NO ONE THERE. THERE WAS NOT THE HEAD OF STATE, CASTRO, ANYBODY, AND THEN HE GOES THE SAUDI ARABIA AND SAME THING HAPPENS. THE BIG LEADERS ARE NOT THERE TO GREET HIM AT THE PLANE. YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO? IF I SAID, HOW ARE WE DOING? WHO IS HERE TO GREET ME? I AM ON THE AIR FORCE ONE. WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO GREET YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. HERE IS WHAT I DO. PILOT, GO BACK TO WASHINGTON. GO BACK TO WASHINGTON. AND I LOVE THE CUBAN PEOPLE AND I LOVE THE SAUDI'S. GO AHEAD. LET'S HAVE SOME FUN. IT'S FRIDAY. LET'S HAVE SOME FUN. LET'S HAVE SOME FUN. I HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD. LOTS OF IT. GREAT PEOPLE. GREAT PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE APPLE AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE COMPANIES, YOU WATCH. THEY'RE GOING TO START MAKING THEIR PRODUCTS IN OUR COUNTRY. YOU WATCH. YOU WATCH. I KNOW HOW TO FIX THE SYSTEM. YOU HAVE THESE GUYS THAT TALK ABOUT FREE TRADE. LOOK WHAT FREE-TRADE HAS DONE TO OUR COUNTRY. NO MATTER WHERE I GO, NO MATTER WHERE I GO, LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH FREE-TRADE. I BELIEVE IN FREE TRADE, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IN BEING STUPID. I DON'T BELIEVE IN THESE DEALS. A ARE SO BAD. WE HAVE TO MAKE GREAT DEALS. WE HAVE A LOT OF TIME. I TOLD THE STORY A COUPLE OF TIMES. HE IS SO HONORED BY IT. A FRIEND OF MINE IS DYING. HE IS VERY SICK. HE IS THE TOUGHEST GUY AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE TOUGHEST GUY. SUCCESSFUL. HE MADE HIMSELF SUCCESSFUL. HE JUST MADE HIMSELF. HE IS A GOOD PERSON, BUT REALLY A TOUGH PERSON AND I LIKE HIM. HE IS A WINNER AND HE GETS SICK. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD YEAR AGO. HE HAS GOOD GENETICS OR SOMETHING. WE SPEAK TO THE DOCTORS AND SAY, HOW IS HE DOING? WE CAN'T BELIEVE IT. HE IS ALIVE A YEAR LONGER THAN HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE. I CALL HIM EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS. HOW ARE YOU DOING? I'M ALL RIGHT. IN A WAY, IT REMINDS ME OF OUR COUNTRY. OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN SO ABUSED FOR SO LONG BY INCOMPETENT POLITICIANS, BY HORRIBLE DEALS, BY HORRIBLE DEALS. WE HAVE POTENTIALLY THE GREATEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD, BUT IT IS BEING DECIMATED WITH CUTS AND PROBLEMS. WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF OUR FATS. WE LOSE ON EVERYTHING WILL FRONT -- EVERY SINGLE FRONT. AND THEN WE MAKE TRADE DEALS THAT ARE HARD TO BELIEVE. A FRIEND OF MINE SAID HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A DEAL LIKE THAT? THEY MUST BE STUPID. THEY ARE NOT STUPID. THEY GET MAJOR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. THEY ARE PAID OFF WITH CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. IT IS SAD. IT REMINDS ME OF MY FRIEND. THIS COUNTRY, IT KEEPS GOING. THE DEBT KEEPS GETTING LARGER. NOW WE ARE UP TO $19 BILLION. THEY SIGNED A HORRIBLE BUDGET DEAL THREE MONTHS AGO, WHICH FUNDS THE SYRIANS COMING IN. IT TAKES CARE OF A LIMO -- CARE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION COMING IN. IT TAKES CARE OF OBAMACARE, WHICH IS A DISASTER. WE WILL REPEAL IT AND REPLACE IT. IT REMINDS ME OF MY FRIEND. IT SHOWS YOU HOW GREAT OUR COUNTRY IS THAT OUR COUNTRY CAN BE ABUSED BY POLITICIANS WHO ARE SO CORRUPT OR INCOMPETENT THAT WE CONTINUE TO GO ALONG. WE ARE SITTING ON A BIG BUBBLE AND WE HAD BETTER GET GOING FAST BECAUSE IT IS NOT GOING TO BE PRETTY. IT WILL BE LIKE NO OTHER. WE HAD BETTER GET GOING FAST OR IT -- GET GOING FAST. THANK YOU. WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY. THE THING WE HAVE IN COMMON IS WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY, RIGHT?  WE DO. IT IS AMAZING. MY FAMILY ASKED ME, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? WHERE ARE YOU GOING TOMORROW? I GET UP AT 5:00 AND I TRAVEL TO A STATE FAR AWAY AND THEN I GO TO ANOTHER ONE AND ANOTHER ONE AND THEN I COME HOME. I SHOULD BE HOME AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING AND I GET UP AT 6:00 THE NEXT DAY. MY DAUGHTER YVONNE CUP -- IVANKA SAID WHAT YOU DO THAT? I SAID IT IS SIMPLE. I LOVE THIS COUNTRY. THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN SO GOOD TO ME. I WOULD RATHER NOT DO IT. I WISH WE HAD SOMEBODY TO WAS SO GOOD, I DON'T CARE OF IT AS A REPUBLICAN OR A DEMOCRAT. IF WE HAD A GREAT PRESIDENT WHO IS A DEMOCRAT -- WE NEED A GREAT PRESIDENT. WE NEED A GREAT, GREAT PRESIDENT BECAUSE WE ARE REALLY IN TROUBLE. BUT I WISH, AND I TOLD MY WIFE, I WISH WE HAD A GREAT PRESIDENT. I'M A REPUBLICAN. I'M A CONSERVATIVE. YOU KNOW THEY SAY -- JEB BUSH. HE SAID, HE IS NOT A CONSERVATIVE. WHY? BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE FREE-TRADE IF IT IS STUPID TRADE. IT IS STUPID TRADE. FREE TRADE IS FINE. WE GET OUTSMARTED BECAUSE WE DO NOT USE OUR BEST AND FINEST. YOU SAW WHEN I WON. CARL ICAHN WAS THERE. WE HAVE THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ON OUR SIDE. WE DON'T USE THEM. WE USE POLITICAL HACKS. WE USE PEOPLE WITH NO ABILITY WHATSOEVER TO NEGOTIATE MASSIVE DEALS BIGGER THAN ANY BUSINESS DEAL YOU COULD EVER DO. THE BIGGEST COMPANY IS SMALL COMPARE TO TRADE DEALS. WE USE POLITICAL HACKS TO NEGOTIATE THE BIGGEST DEALS IN THE WORLD AGAINST CHINA, WHERE THEY USE PEOPLE THAT ARE THE SMARTEST AND THE TOUGHEST. HIGH ENERGY. REMEMBER WHEN I SAID LOW ENERGY? THEY ARE VERY HIGH ENERGY. THEY COME IN WAVES AS NEGOTIATORS. I HAVE MADE A LOT OF MONEY NEGOTIATING AGAINST CHINA. YOU CAN BE CHINA. YOU HAVE TO BE SMART, YOU HAVE TO BE SHARP. THE LARGEST BANK OF THE WORLD IS A TENET OF MINE FROM CHINA IN A BUILDING IN MANHATTAN. THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT, THE PEOPLE, THEY ARE GREAT. I AM NOT ANGRY AT MEXICO FOR RIPPING US OFF, WHICH THEY ARE DOING BOTH AT THE BORDER AND ON TRADE. I'M NOT ANGRY AT CHINA. I AM NOT ANGRY AT JAPAN. JAPAN SENDS CARS BY THE MILLION. YOU KNOW WHAT WE GIVE THEM? PRACTICALLY NOTHING. EVER HEAR THE WORDS TRADE IMBALANCE? IT IS LIKE THIS. IT HAS GOT TO END. I'M NOT ANGRY AT JAPAN. I'M NOT ANGRY AT VIETNAM AND INDIA, ALL THESE COUNTRIES. YOU EVER CALL UPON YOUR CREDIT CARD? YOU WANT TO FIND OUT ABOUT YOUR CREDIT CARD. YOU WERE TALKING TO A PERSON FROM INDIA. HOW DOES THAT WORK? WHERE ARE YOU FROM? I WAS NOT CHECKING ON MY CARD, I WAS FINDING OUT IF THIS WAS TRUE. I CALLED UP UNDER THE GUISE OF CHECKING MY CAR. WHERE ARE YOU FROM? WE ARE FROM INDIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT IS ALL I NEED. INDIA IS A GREAT PLACE. I AM NOT UPSET WITH OTHER LEADERS. I AM UPSET WITH OUR LEADERS FOR BEING SO STUPID. SO STUPID. THE MIDDLE CLASS THAT BUILT THIS COUNTRY, WHICH I AM REALLY INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS. THESE PEOPLE, YOU ARE TIRED AND YOU ARE DISGUSTED. YOU ARE TIRED AND YOU ARE DISGUSTED. PEOPLE ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS. THEY ARE WORKING HARDER AND IN MANY CASES THEY ARE WORKING A SECOND JOB AS THEY NEVER DID BEFORE. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE OTHER WAY. YOU DO A GOOD JOB AND YOU TAKE IT EASY. THEY ARE NOW WORKING HARDER AND THEY MAKE LESS MONEY THAN THEY MADE 18 YEARS AGO. THEIR REAL WAGES ARE LESS THAN THEY WERE 18 YEARS AGO. THEN PEOPLE SAY, DONALD, THERE IS A LOT OF ANGER AT YOUR RALLIES. THEY ARE NOT ANGRY PEOPLE. THEY ARE ANGRY AT WHAT IS HAPPENING. THERE ARE ACTUALLY HAPPY PEOPLE. THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE. WHEN I WON SOUTH CAROLINA, NIKKI HALEY, THE GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA, BUT SHE BACKED SOMEBODY ELSE, WHO I'D BE VERY BADLY. THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR BACK TO ME AND THE GOVERNOR BACKED SOMEBODY ELSE AND I SAID, I WANT THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, RIGHT? BUT NIKKI HALEY MADE A SPEECH. IT WAS A RESPONSE TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH. SHE TALKED ABOUT US, NOT ME. US. SHE SAID THEY ARE ANGRY. SOMEBODY CALLED FROM THE PRESS RIGHT AFTER THAT SPEECH. MY LINES WERE GOING CRAZY. THEY SAID, ARE YOU ANGRY? AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO SAY NO WE ARE NOT ANGRY. WE ARE ANGRY. WE ARE ANGRY AT WHAT IS HAPPENING. I SAY THIS ALWAYS. WE ARE NOT ANGRY PEOPLE. WE ARE REASONABLE PEOPLE. WE ARE ANGRY AT WHAT IS HAPPENING, BUT WE ARE NOT ANGRY PEOPLE. WE ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. HARD-WORKING, INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. BUT WE ARE ANGRY AT A SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT ALLOW US TO ACHIEVE ANYTHING. WE GIVE ALL OUR MONEY AWAY. WE HAVE MILITARY DEALS WHERE WE PROTECT EVERY COUNTRY. WE ALWAYS SAY WE SPENT MANY TIMES WHAT ANY COUNTRY SPENDS ON THE MILITARY. MANY, MANY TIMES. YOU THINK WE ARE SPENDING ON DOVER? WHO IS HERE FROM DOVER? GOOD PLACE. I'LL BET IT COULD USE A LITTLE OF FLIPPING, RIGHT -- UPLIFTING, RIGHT? WE SPEND ON DEFENDING OTHER COUNTRIES. EVERYONE SAYS, THE MILITARY, GREAT. WE ARE NOT SPENDING THE MONEY. WE ARE SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY DEFENDING. GERMANY. YOU KNOW WE DEFEND GERMANY, RIGHT? NOBODY KNOWS THAT. WE DEFEND JAPAN. WE DEFEND SOUTH KOREA. WE ARE RIGHT NEXT TO THE MAD MEN. NO DUMMY. ANYONE THAT CAN TAKE OVER FROM HIS FATHER WITH ALL THOSE TILL HER GENERALS, NO DUMMY. -- THOSE KILLER GENERALS, NO DUMMY. I THINK HE IS A LITTLE OFF. DIDN'T HIS UNCLE FIND THAT OUT? HIS ENCORE WAS CUT UP INTO 40 PIECES BECAUSE HE RAISED HIS VOICE -- HIS UNCLE WAS CUT UP INTO 40 PIECES BECAUSE HE RAISED HIS VOICE. THE PROBLEM IS IT IS AN ECONOMIC BEHEMOTH. WHEN I WANT A TELEVISION SET, I ORDERED THOUSANDS OF TELEVISION SETS A YEAR FOR DIFFERENT PROJECTS. WHEN I WANT A TELEVISION, IT COMES FROM SOUTH KOREA. SONY COMES FROM JAPAN. FROM SOUTH KOREA, LG, SAMSUNG, ALL THESE. WE DON'T MAKE TELEVISIONS ANYMORE. THIS GUY, GEORGE WILL, HE SAYS, WHY DOESN'T SOMEBODY SAY THAT WE DO HAVE A TELEVISION COMPANY IN THIS COUNTRY? IS A COUNTRY THAT YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF, A COMPANY THAT ASSEMBLES PARTS. THE PARTS COME FROM SOUTH KOREA. THEY USED TO SAY DONALD TRUMP WON'T RUN. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. PEOPLE NOT RUN. AND THEN I READ, OH, HE RAN. HE WILL NOT FILE FORM A. I FILED FOR MADE. THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS. HE WILL NOT FILE HIS FINANCIALS. HE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE -- YOU WERE ALLOWED TO PUSH IT OFF FOREVER. YOU HAVE 30 DAYS BUT YOU GET 45 DAY EXTENSIONS AS LONG AS YOU WANT. I WANT TO HAVE MY FINANCIALS FILED IN 30 DAYS. THE BIGGEST FINANCIALS IN HISTORY OF ELECTIONS. MOST 100 PAGES. I TELL MY ACCOUNTANTS FROM WASHINGTON AND MY LAWYERS, ALL THESE PEOPLE EXPENSIVE PEOPLE. I SPEND A FORTUNE. IT IS SO COMPLICATED. TAXES ARE WAY DOWN. IT IS LOWER BY FAR, IT IS SIMPLE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE H&R BLOCK ANYMORE. GREAT FOR BUSINESS, GREAT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. LOWER TAXES. LOWER TAXES. THE HIGHEST-TAXED NATION IN THE WORLD. I FILED MY PAPERS. THESE GUYS, THE MEDIA, IT WAS LIKE A FEEDING FRENZY. IT WAS LIKE A FEEDING FRENZY IN WASHINGTON IN FRONT OF THE ELECTION. THEY WANTED TO SAY, WAIT A MINUTE. LOOK HOW LITTLE -- THIS IS TERRIBLE. EXCEPT MY COMPANY TURNS OUT TO BE MUCH BIGGER, MUCH STRONGER. THAT IS WHY YOU DON'T HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT IT. FRIEND OF MINE SAID WHEN I ANNOUNCED I AM RUNNING, BECAUSE I AM A PRIVATE PERSON. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT I OWN. FRIEND OF MINE SAYS DONALD, YOU ANNOUNCE YOUR RUNNING NOW I KNOW YOU'RE RICH BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO FILE. I BUILT A COMPANY THAT IS PHENOMENAL. I BUILT SOME OF THE GREATEST ASSETS IN THE WORLD. I BORROWED $1 MILLION NOT SO LONG AGO. I BORROWED $1 MILLION AND NOW IT IS WORTH OVER $10 BILLION. SOME OF THE GREAT ASSETS OF THE WORLD. MIAMI AND TURNBERRY AND SCOTLAND, OFFICE BUILDINGS ALL OVER THE PLACE. VERY LITTLE DEBT, TREMENDOUS CASH FLOW. ONE OF THE GREAT COMPANIES. I DON'T SAY THAT BRAGGING WAY. I SAY THAT BECAUSE THAT IS THE KIND OF THINKING OUR COUNTRY NEEDS AT LEAST UNTIL WE GET THINGS STRAIGHTENED OUT. WE NEED IT. WE NEED IT. BOY, WE NEED IT. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE A CLUE. A GUY LIKE OBAMA NEVER EMPLOYED ONE PERSON IN HIS LIFE. HE NEVER EMPLOYED A PERSON. THINK OF IT. RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. HE REFUSES TO MENTION THE WORDS. YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. HE SEES PARIS, HE DOES NOT WANT TO A KNOWLEDGE IT HEARD HE SEES WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE 14 PEOPLE KILLED, MANY PEOPLE INJURED IN CALIFORNIA. HE DOES NOT WANT TO A KNOWLEDGE IT. HE WILL NEVER ACKNOWLEDGE IT. THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON THERE THAT IS STRANGE. WHY CAN'T HE SAY RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM? UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE IT. THIS STARTED ON JUNE 16 WHEN I CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR WITH MY WIFE AND I SAID, WOW. I LOOKED DOWN AT TRUMP TOWER AND IT LOOKED LIKE THE ACADEMY AWARDS, THERE WAS SO MUCH PRESS. I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. EVEN HERE, WE HAVE A LOT. LOOK AT THOSE CAMERAS GOING. THEY NEVER SHOW THE CROWD. THEY NEVER -- YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW , WITH BERNIE, HILLARY, THEY CAN'T TALK ABOUT BECAUSE HER CROWDS ARE SO SMALL. WITH BERNIE, IF HE HAS A BIG CROWD, THEY WITH DOUBLE IT. BERNIE HAD 25,000. HE DID NOT HAVE 25,000. THEY SAID IT WAS 28,000. THEY WERE NOT 28,000. WITH ME, THEY NEVER DO IT. I WAS IN ALABAMA. WE HAD 35,000 PEOPLE OR MORE. THEY GO, YOU DON'T EVEN SEE IT. THEY KEEP THE CAMERAS ON ME. I GO HOME AND THEY SAY TO MY WIFE, DID YOU SEE THE CROWD? NO. THEY DID NOT SHOWED IT. THE ONLY THING I LIKE IS THE PHONY PROTESTERS. MOST OF THEM ARE PUT THERE. AS SOON AS SOMEBODY RAISES THEIR HAND, USUALLY WITH A WEAK VOICE AND START SHOUTING, BECAUSE THE CAMERAS FOLLOW THEM. LOOK AT HOW BIG THE CROWD IS TODAY ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON? WITH BERNIE, AND BERNIE IS OUT AND I AM SORT OF HAPPY BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO RUN AGAINST CROOKED HILLARY. DON'T WE WANT TO RUN AGAINST CROOKED HILLARY? ALL THE POLLS SAY THAT IF IT IS DONALD TRUMP AGAINST CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON, IT WILL BE, SERIOUSLY, IT WILL BE THE GREATEST TURNOUT OF VOTERS IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. I BELIEVE THAT. I BELIEVE IT. I MEAN, THINK OF THIS. TRUMP AGAINST CLINTON. HOW ABOUT THIS? LYING TED CRUZ? IT DOES NOT WORK. SHE WOULD BEAT HIM SO BADLY, HE WOULD LOSE SOME MANY STATES, THERE IS NO CHANCE. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM THIS WEEKEND. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM THIS WEEK. HE LOST TO KASICH. CRUZ CAME IN THIRD. HE IS SO EMBARRASSED THAT HE WALKED AWAY FROM THE CAMERAS. HE CAME IN THIRD IN NEW YORK. I WILL WIN NEW YORK AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON. I THINK I'M GOING TO WIN NEW YORK. AND I WILL WIN MICHIGAN AND I WILL WIN PENNSYLVANIA. AND OF COURSE WE ARE GOING TO WIN DELAWARE. WE KNOW THAT, RIGHT? AND I WILL WIN FLORIDA. WE HAD A HUGE WIN IN FLORIDA. WE WON BY MORE THAN 20 POINTS. I WAS NOT EXPECTING TO WIN FLORIDA. JUST TO SHOW YOU THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO WIN BIG. ON TUESDAY, EVERYONE HAS TO GO OUT AND VOTE. WE HAVE TO WIN BIG BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED. THE FIGHTERS HAVE A GREAT EXPRESSION. YOU HAVE A CHAMP THAT GOES INTO A BIG TERRITORY BUT IT IS UNFRIENDLY. IT IS THE HOME OF THE OTHER FIGHTER. NO, I'M NOT WORRIED. IF I KNOCK HIM OUT, THERE IS NOTHING THE JUDGES CAN DO. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS KNOCK THEM OUT WITH VOLUME OF VOTES. RIGHT NOW I HAVE MILLIONS MORE VOTES THAN CRUZ, MILLIONS MORE VOTES THAN KASICH, I HAVE ALMOST 300 OR DELEGATES THAN CRUZ, EVEN THOUGH IT IS A CROOKED SYSTEM. THEY TAKE HIM OUT TO DINNER, A SEND THEM TO HOTELS. IT IS SUCH A CROOKED SYSTEM. IT IS DISGUSTING. KASICH, THINK OF THIS. KASICH IS ONE FOR 38. YOU KNOW WHAT HIS ANSWER IS I'M NOT LEAVING. I'M NOT LEAVING. CRUZ SAID KASICH COULD GET OUT. THERE IS NO WAY HE COULD WIN. THERE IS ONLY ONE PROBLEM. NOW THERE IS NO PATH TO VICTORY FOR CRUZ, SO HE SHOULD GET OUT. THEY SHOULD BOTH GET OUT. WHEN THEY GET OUT, WHEN THEY GET OUT, WE WILL START ON HILLARY CLINTON LIKE NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. NOBODY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN UNBELIEVABLE TIME. THEY SAID TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN CLINTON'S CAMP, WHO DOES SHE LEAST WANT TO RUN AGAINST? THE GUY SAID TRUMP. LOOK WHAT HE DID. HE HAD 17 SENATORS, GOVERNORS, VERY CAPABLE PEOPLE LIKE BEN CARSON, WHO ENDORSED ME AND IS AN INCREDIBLE GUY AND SMART AND GOOD, AND CHRIS CHRISTIE, THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY, A GREAT GUY, A GREAT GUY, BUT LOOK WHAT HE DID TO THOSE PEOPLE ONE AFTER ANOTHER. BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. NOW I AM LEFT WITH HARDLY TWO GUYS. THERE IS NO PATH. ONE AND A HALF. MAYBE YOU CAN JUST SAY ONE. A HALF AND A HALF. THAT IS WHAT O'REILLY SAID LAST NIGHT. HE GOES INTO THIS THING, HE IS COMPETING AGAINST SENATORS AND GOVERNORS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF OUR NATION, AND ONE BY ONE THEY GET KNOCKED OFF. THIS PERSON FROM OBAMA'S CAMPAIGN, WHY THINK IS NOW INVOLVED WITH HILLARY CLINTON, SAID THE PERSON SHE LEAST WANTS TO RUN AGAINST HIS TRUMP BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS COMING FROM. THIS GUY. IT IS TRUE. I TELL THIS ALL THE TIME, THE WORD UNPREDICTABLE. WE HAVE TO BE UNPREDICTABLE. OUR MILITARY IS TOTALLY PREDICTABLE. OBAMA GETS UP. WE WILL LEAVE IRAQ. HE GIVES A DATE. CAN YOU IMAGINE GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR, GENERAL GEORGE PATTON, HEARING THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES GAVE AN EXACT DATE? HOW ABOUT A FEW MONTHS AGO, WE SAID 50 OF OUR FINEST PEOPLE OVER TO IRAQ AND SYRIA IN THE PRESENT HAS A NEWS CONFERENCE TO ANNOUNCE WE ARE SENDING 50 OF OUR FINEST. WHAT HAPPENS? YOU KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING? ISIS IS LOOKING FOR THOSE PEOPLE LIKE YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE, RIGHT? WHY DOES HE HAVE TO TALK? WHY DOES HE HAVE TO SAY IT? FIRST OF ALL, WHEN YOU SAY 50 PEOPLE, THESE ARE ELITE PEOPLE. IT IS NOT ENOUGH. 50 PEOPLE? BUT IN TERMS OF SCARING SOMEBODY, IN TERMS OF SCARING -- BUT WHY WOULD HE ANNOUNCE THIS? WHEN THEY ANNOUNCE IT, THEY HAVE A TARGET ON THEIR BACK. THEY ARE BEING LOOKED FOR. I HAVE FRIENDS IN THE MILITARY SAID THAT IT WAS SO DEVASTATING, THEY DID NOT WANT TO GO. THESE ARE TOUGH, BRAVE SOLDIERS. WHY ARE YOU ANNOUNCING? BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HAVE SOME KIND OF A POLITICAL BENEFIT. WE HAVE TO BE UNPREDICTABLE. WHEN HE ANNOUNCED AN EXACT DATE, I SAID THAT IS SMART BECAUSE HE IS PROBABLY DOING A LITTLE CAMOUFLAGE, RIGHT? IT WASN'T. THE ENEMY PULLS BACK AND THEN WE ARE GONE AND BOY, DID THEY HIT US. ISIS FORMED. LOTS OF BAD THINGS HAPPEN. HILLARY WANTED TO GO TO LIBYA, RIGHT? LIBYA HAS THE FINEST OIL. IT IS OF HIGH AND IT IS THE FINEST QUALITY OIL. WHO HAS THE OIL RIGHT NOW? ISIS. WE DON'T EVEN BLOCKADE THAT. THEY ARE TAKING OUT THE OIL. WE ARE HITTING OTHER OIL PORTS AND WE ARE HITTING OTHER OIL REFINERIES. HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN SAYING TAKE THE OIL? FOUR YEARS, RIGHT? OBAMA'S PEOPLE SAY THAT IS NOT A PLAN. IT'S A GREAT PLAN. THE PROBLEM IS ISIS HAS GOTTEN VERY RICH WITH THE OIL AND WITH THE DARK BANKING CHANNELS, AND I KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT BANKING. DO I KNOW BANKING? I AM THE KING. I KNOW ALMOST AS MUCH AS ALL THE PEOPLE IN DELAWARE ABOUT BANKING. DO I KNOW. THEY ARE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY OFF OF CROOKED BANKING. THEY CALL IT THE DARK BANKING CIRCLES. THEY ARE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY. THEY ARE MAKING FORTUNES OF MONEY WITH THE OIL. WE DON'T HIT THEM. DID YOU EVER HEAR WE SENT LEAFLETS DOWN? PLEASE LEAVE YOUR TRUCK. WE WILL BE BOMBING YOUR TRUCK SHORTLY. WHEN I FIRST HEARD THAT, I LAUGHED BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY WERE KIDDING. THEY ARE NOT GETTING. THEN WE DON'T HIT THE REFINERIES BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO CAUSE ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION. YOU HAVE HEARD THAT TOO, RIGHT? CAN YOU IMAGINE GUYS LIKE GEORGE PATTON, THAT WAS ROUGH AND TOUGH? IF HE EVER HEARD THAT STUFF -- FIRST, HE WOULD NEVER BE A GENERAL TODAY BECAUSE HE IS NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT. HE USED TO SLAP HIS SOLDIERS. IF YOU SLAP A SOLDIER, THEY WOULD PUT HIM IN PRISON FOR 15 YEARS. THIS GUY WAS TOUGH. SOLDIERS LOVED HIM. THEY WOULD DIE FOR HIM. THEY DID DIE FOR HIM. HE WOULD BE RIGHT UP THERE WITH HIM. COULD YOU IMAGINE IF THEY SAID WE CAN'T REALLY HURT ANYBODY, WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING AND WE DON'T WANT TO BOMB THE OIL BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THE PLUME TO GO UP AND HURT THE ATMOSPHERE. HONESTLY, FOLKS? WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING. DURING ONE OF THE DEBATES WHEN THEY ASKED LINE TED ABOUT WATERBOARDING, THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT WATERBOARDING AND HE DID NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. I UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE IT IS A TOUGH QUESTION. FOR ME, NOT SO TOUGH. THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT WATERBOARDING. DID YOU EVER SEE HIM WHEN HE GETS SOMETHING THAT HE IS UNCOMFORTABLE AND HE STARTS TO STUMBLE LIKE A FOOL. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. HE DID NOT GIVE AN ANSWER. THEN THEY TOOK THE CAMERA. ON THE DEBATE, I WAS CENTER STAGE FOR EVERY SINGLE DEBATE. I DIDN'T KNOW IF I COULD DEBATE. I HAD NEVER DEBATED BEFORE PROFESSIONALLY. I HEARD CRUZ WAS A GOOD DEBATER IN COLLEGE. HE HAD NEVER BEEN INTERRUPTED. I INTERRUPTED HIM AND HE WENT CRAZY. ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT WOULD HAPPEN AND HAPPEN TO US AS A NATION, IT IS MAKING US LOOK FOOLISH. IT IS MAKING US LOOK STUPID. IT IS GOING TO CHANGE. IF I GET ELECTED, IT IS GOING TO CHANGE FAST. LET ME JUST TELL YOU. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE GREAT TRADE DEALS. YOU ARE ABOUT CARRIER, FORD, NABISCO. NABISCO LEFT CHICAGO. THERE -- THEY ARE BUILDING A PLANT IN MEXICO. CARRIER ANNOUNCED THEY ARE LAYING OFF 1400 PEOPLE AND MOVING TO MEXICO. IT WAS A VICIOUS ANNOUNCEMENT. IN UPPER LEVEL GUY SAID WE ARE MOVING TO MEXICO, EVERYONE WILL BE FIRED. NASTY. FORD, BUILDING A $2.5 BILLION PLANT FROM TWO YEARS AGO. NOW THEY ARE DOUBLING UP. WHEN THEY DO IT, NOBODY GOES TO TALK TO THEM. NOBODY TELLS THEM OF CONSEQUENCES. THEY HAVE NO CONSEQUENCES. HERE IS TRUMP. PRESIDENT FORD, TAKE FORD, TAKE CARRIER, TAKE ANY OF THEM. I LIKED TO JOKE BECAUSE WE HAVE FUN WITH IT. MY WIFE OR DAUGHTER, THEY SAY, DAD, PLEASE BE MORE PRESIDENTIAL. I CAN'T. RIGHT NOW I HAVE TO BE THESE PEOPLE. DON'T WORRY. BEING PRESIDENTIAL FOR ME IS MUCH EASIER THAN DOING THIS. IF I WAS TOTALLY PRESIDENTIAL, WE HAVE 10,000 PEOPLE HERE OR SOMETHING? I WOULD HAVE ABOUT 300 AND YOU WOULD BE FALLING ASLEEP AFTER 20 MINUTES. HONESTLY, I PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE HERE BECAUSE I WAS HIT REALLY HARD BY THESE 17 PEOPLE. I WAS HIT REALLY, REALLY HARD. IF I DID NOT HIT THEM BACK HARDER, I WOULD NOT BE HERE. I WOULD BE HOME WATCHING THIS THING ON TELEVISION. THERE WOULD BE NO CROWDS LIKE THIS. IT WOULD BE IN SOME LITTLE CONFERENCE ROOM IN A HOTEL SOMEPLACE. RIGHT? SO I HIT HARD. WE ARE GOING TO BE VERY PRESIDENTIAL. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE OUR COUNTRY RESPECTED AGAIN. YOU WILL BE PROUD OF YOUR PRESIDENT, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY YOU WILL BE PROUD OF YOUR COUNTRY. YOU'RE GOING TO BE REALLY PROUD OF YOUR COUNTRY. I WOULD DO THE FOLLOWING. SO CARRIER. THIS PERTAINS TO HUNDREDS OF BUSINESSES. I WANT TO DO IT MYSELF. YOU KNOW, IS GOING TO BE TOUGH FOR ME BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE THESE CALLS MYSELF A BUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT BE CALLING IN AIR CONDITIONING COMPANY, RIGHT? IT IS SO EASY FOR ME. IT IS SO NATURAL. I LOVE DOING IT. I DON'T TAKE VACATIONS. OTHER PEOPLE GO AWAY FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS. I LEARNED THAT FROM MY FATHER. MY FATHER WAS A HARD WORKER AND HE NEVER TOOK VACATIONS. IF YOU LOVE WHAT YOU DO, YOU DON'T TAKE VACATIONS. HE TOOK ONE VACATION AND HE CAME BACK EARLY. HE WAS GOING NUTS. HE SAID I WAS GOING CRAZY. I HAD TO GET BACK. THAT MEANS YOU LOVE YOUR LIFE. I DON'T TAKE VACATIONS, UNLIKE OBAMA WHO TAKES A PLANE THAT FLIES INTO HAWAII. THINK OF IT. HE TAKES A BOEING 747 AND HE FLIES IT TWO HAWAII TO PLAY GOLF AND THEN HE TALKS ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING. IF THAT PERSON OK? EVERYTHING GOOD? WE LOVE OUR PEOPLE, RIGHT? WE LOVE OUR PEOPLE.  THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE LOVE. THOSE ARE REAL GREAT PEOPLE, RIGHT? THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE LOVE. SO HE FLIES A 747 TO PLAY GOLF. THERE A LONG TIME, TWO OR THREE WEEKS. HE PLAYS MORE GOLF THAN PEOPLE WHO PLAY PROFESSIONALLY ON THE PGA TOUR. I LIKE GOLF, BUT YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE GOT TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS, FOLKS. HERE IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. WE GOING TO TELL CARRIER, LISTEN, YOU LET GO OF 1400 PEOPLE. NABISCO, THE SAME CONVERSATION. USE A RECORDER. SAME CONVERSATION. WE TELL THEM, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU HAVE TO SEE THEM EARLY, BECAUSE IF YOU DO NOT SEE THEM EARLY, YOU ARE GOING TO MOVE AND BE TOO LATE. IF YOU SEE THEM EARLY, DIFFERENT. HEY, YOU ARE GOING TO MOVE, HERE IS THE DEAL. YOU ARE GOING TO PAY A 35% TAX ON EVERY AIR CONDITIONING UNIT THAT YOU SEND ACROSS THE NOW VERY STRONG BORDER, RIGHT? EVERY TIME YOU MAKE A UNIT, IT IS GOING TO COST YOU 35% TAX. HERE IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. IF IT IS LYING TED CRUZ OR IF IT IS KASICH OR HILLARY, THEY ARE LOBBYISTS, THEY ARE SPECIAL INTERESTS, THEIR DONORS WILL CALL THEM AND SAY YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO CARRIER OR NABISCO. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. THESE PEOPLE GAVE YOU MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. URI. I CAN'T DO THAT. WITH ME, FORGET. I'M SELF FUNDING. I'M NOT TAKING THEIR MONEY. HERE IS THE STORY. THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO HAVE PEOPLE CALL ME. I WOULD NOT EVEN TAKE THEIR CALLS BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT IS RIGHT AND WRONG. WE'RE LOSING OUR JOBS. WE ARE LOSING OUR PAY. WE ARE LOSING OUR MONEY. WE ARE GETTING KILLED. WE ARE GETTING KILLED DURING HERE IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. WITHIN 24 HOURS, THE HEAD OF CARRIER IS GOING TO CALL THE PRESIDENT. MR. PRESIDENT, WE'VE DECIDED TO STAY IN THE UNITED STATES. OR, IF THEY HAVE ALREADY MOVED AND THEY ARE BUILDING THEIR PLANT, I WOULD SAY, ENJOY YOUR PLANT. EVERY SINGLE TIME A UNIT CROSSES OUR NOW VERY POWERFUL AND STRONG BORDER, BECAUSE THE WALL WILL BE THERE AND AGENTS WILL BE THERE, YOU ARE PAYING A TAX. YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN? ONE OF TWO THINGS. THEY ARE EITHER COMING BACK OR WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY COLLECTING TAXES. IF YOU LOOK, OUR GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS PROBLEM FOR FIVE YEARS. STOPPING COMPANIES FROM LEAVING. THEY SAID WE WILL GIVE THEM INCENTIVES. WE WILL TRY TO LOWER THEIR TAXES. WE'RE THE HIGHEST TAXED NATION IN THE WORLD BY FAR. THEY WANT TO GIVE INCENTIVES. THEY DON'T EVEN BOTHER TALKING. THEY JUST LEAVE. THEY ARE NOT TALKING TO THE GOVERNMENT. EVEN IF THEY DID, THERE IS ONLY ONE THING YOU CAN DO. THEY ARE LOOKING AT ALL SORTS OF FORMULAS. I AM A FREE TRADER, BUT WE HAVE STUPID PEOPLE ON OUR SIDE NEGOTIATING. FREE TRADE IS GREAT, BUT NO GOOD FOR US BECAUSE IT HAS NOT WORK.","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Campaign Rally in Harrington, Delaware"

I GUESS WE ARE CLOSE TO 70%, AND WE ARE GOING TO END A HIGH LEVEL AND GET A LOT MORE DELEGATES , THAN ANYBODY PROJECTED, EVEN IN THEIR WILDEST IMAGINATIONS. SO I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY HERE. I WANT TO THANK MY FAMILY.   I REALLY WANT TO THANK MY TEAM. MY TEAM HAS BEEN AMAZING. YOU KNOW, IT IS ACTUALLY A TEAM OF UNITY. IT IS EVOLVING, BUT PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. THE PRESS DOES UNDERSTAND IT. THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. THAT IS OK. JUST KEEP TALKING. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. KEEP TALKING. THIS HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE EVENING, AN INCREDIBLE DAY AND WEEK. WE WENT ALL OVER NEW YORK STATE. NEW YORK STATE HAS PROBLEMS LIKE VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER STATE IN THE UNION. OUR JOBS ARE BEING SUCKED OUT OF OUR STATE. THEY ARE BEING TAKEN OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN ANYMORE. WE ARE GOING TO STOP IT. VERY IMPORTANTLY, AND BEHIND ME I HAVE TO SAY, WE HAVE SOME OF OUR GREAT BUSINESSMEN OF THE WORLD. CARL ICAHN IS HERE SOMEPLACE. WHERE IS CARL? BEN LEBEAU, THE GREAT STEVE ROSS. STEVE IS BUILDING A BIG BUILDING ON CENTRAL PARK SOUTH. IT IS A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. THEY SAID STEVE, CONGRATULATIONS ON THE BUILDING. HE SAID, DONALD, IT IS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH YOU. ANYWAY, WE ARE PROUD OF HIM. WE HAVE OUR GREAT LEADERS. IT HAS BEEN REALLY SOMETHING. IT HAS REALLY BEEN SOMETHING AMAZING. BELIEVE ME, WE ARE GOING TO USE OUR GREAT BUSINESS PEOPLE TO NEGOTIATE UNBELIEVABLE TRADE DEALS SO WE BRING OUR JOBS BACK AND WE DON'T LET OUR COMPANIES GO TO MEXICO AND ALL OF THESE OTHER COUNTRIES ANYMORE. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP THE JOBS HERE. YOU ARE GOING TO BE VERY PROUD OF THIS COUNTRY VERY SOON. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD OUR MILITARY BIGGER, BETTER, STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. [CHEERS AND  NOBODY IS GOING TO MESS WITH US. THAT I CAN TELL YOU. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS. VETS ARE GREAT PEOPLE. WE HAVE FORGOTTEN OUR VETS. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE TAKING -- ARE TAKEN CARE OF IN MANY CASES BETTER THAN OUR VETS. THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE. THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. WE ARE GETTING RID OF OBAMACARE. IT IS GOING TO BE REPEALED AND REPLACED. IT IS A TOTAL DISASTER WITH PREMIUMS GOING UP 35%, 45%, 55%. IT IS GOING TO PROBABLY END OF ITS OWN VOLITION. WE ARE GETTING RID OF IT. WE ARE BRINGING COMMON CORE, KNOCKING IT OUT, WE'RE CUTTING IT. IT IS GOING TO BE OVER, AND WE ARE BRINGING EDUCATION LOCALLY. LOCAL COMMUNITIES WILL TAKE CARE OF THEIR EDUCATIONAL NEEDS. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT FOR A LONG TIME. WITH ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TODAY, TONIGHT, AND OVER THE WEEK, I TELL YOU WHAT, THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING WEEK. ALL OVER NEW YORK STATE, WE WANT TO SYRACUSE, WE WENT TO ALBANY. 20,000 PEOPLE. ON AVERAGE, WE WOULD HAVE 15,000 TO 20,000 PEOPLE. WE WENT TO ROCHESTER. WE WENT ALL OVER. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE TRULY ARE GREAT AND AMAZING PEOPLE. WE ARE GOING TO BE SO STRONG AGAIN. REALLY. LEGITIMATELY SO GREAT AGAIN. AND I JUST CAN'T WAIT. SO, WE DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A RACE ANYMORE BASED ON WHAT I AM SEEING ON TELEVISION. SENATOR CRUZ IS JUST ABOUT MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED.   AND WE HAVE WON ANOTHER STATE. AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE WON MILLIONS OF MORE VOTES THAN SENATOR CRUZ. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS MORE VOTES THAN GOVERNOR KASICH. ESPECIALLY AFTER TONIGHT, WE HAVE CLOSE TO 300 DELEGATES MORE THAN SENATOR CRUZ. WE ARE REALLY, REALLY ROCKING. WE EXPECT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN AMAZING NUMBER OF WEEKS BECAUSE THESE ARE PLACES IN BIG TROUBLE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT PENNSYLVANIA, WHEN YOU LOOK AT INDIANA, WHEN YOU LOOK AT MARYLAND AND RHODE ISLAND AND SO MANY PLACES, WE HAVE PROBLEMS EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK. WE ARE GOING TO SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS.   ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS IS THE ECONOMY AND JOBS. AND THAT IS MY WHEELHOUSE. AGAIN, I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY. IT IS REALLY NICE TO WIN THE DELEGATES WITH THE VOTES. YOU KNOW? IT IS REALLY NICE.    NOBODY SHOULD BE GIVEN DELEGATES, WHICH IS A TICKET TO VICTORY. AND IT IS NOT A FAIR TICKET. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE LEADING BY A LOT AND CANNOT BE CAUGHT, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CATCH US, NOBODY SHOULD TAKE DELEGATES AND CLAIM VICTORY UNLESS THEY GET THOSE DELEGATES WITH VOTERS AND VOTING. THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU WATCH, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO STAND FOR IT. IT IS A CROOKED SYSTEM. IT IS A SYSTEM THAT IS RIGGED. WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK TO THE OLD WAY. IT IS CALLED YOU VOTE AND YOU WIN. WE WILL BE GOING INTO THE CONVENTION NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, AND I THINK WE ARE GOING TO GO IN SO STRONG. OVER THE NEXT NUMBER OF WEEKS, WE JUST SAW A POLL OUT OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS AN UNBELIEVABLE POLL. WE ARE GOING TO GO INTO THE CONVENTION I THINK AS THE WINNER. BUT NOBODY CAN TAKE AN ELECTION AWAY WITH THE WAY THEY ARE DOING IT IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND BY THE WAY, I AM NO FAN OF BERNIE. BUT I HAVE SEEN BERNIE WIN, WIN, WIN. AND THEN I WATCH, AND THEY SAY HE HAS NO CHANCE OF WINNING. SO THEY HAVE THEIR SUPERDELEGATES. THE REPUBLICAN SYSTEM IS WORSE. I WANT TO JUST THANK EVERYBODY. I HAVE GREAT ADMIRATION AND PRAISE FOR THE CITY OF NEW YORK AND THE STATE OF NEW YORK. I CAN THINK OF NOWHERE THAT I WOULD RATHER HAVE THIS VICTORY. SO WE LOVE YOU ALL. HAVE A GREAT EVENING. WE CELEBRATE. AND TOMORROW MORNING, WE GO BACK TO WORK. I AM FLYING TOMORROW MORNING TO INDIANA. I'M GOING TO PENNSYLVANIA. I WILL BE ALL OVER. SO WE ARE GOING TO CELEBRATE FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS. THEN EARLY IN THE MORNING, I GET UP AND WE BEGIN WORKING AGAIN. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. AND THANK YOU, NEW YORK. WE LOVE NEW YORK. WE LOVE NEW YORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU.

AN HONOR TO BE WITH SO MANY -- WOW, LOOK AT THIS. I WANT TO THANK YOU. WE HAVE PHENOMENAL POLL NUMBERS IN CONNECTICUT.  WE ARE GOING TO BRING BACK YOUR ECONOMY, JOBS TO CONNECTICUT. WE ARE GOING TO BRING THEM BACK. IT IS SAD WHAT IS HAPPENING. OUR JOBS ARE BEING SENT TO  MEXICO, ALL OVER THE PLACE. EVERYPLACE BUT OUR NATION AND WE  ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN  ANYMORE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT  HAPPEN ANYMORE. REMEMBER THAT. YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST. WITH OUR COMPETITORS, THE PEOPLE  I RUN AGAINST, I'M STILL FUNDING. ELF FUNDING.  I COME ON MY DIME. WHEN THESE OTHER GUYS COME UP,  IT IS A DIFFERENT ROUTE. JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND, THEY ARE CONTROLLED BY THE SPECIAL  INTERESTS, LOBBYISTS. THEY ARE TOTALLY CONTROLLED BY  PEOPLE WHO PUT UP THEIR MONEY.  NO GOOD. WE HAVE HAD IT. WE'VE NOW HAD IT. THIS ALL BEGAN IN JUNE AND I  CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR. I TALKED ABOUT ILLEGAL  IMMIGRATION. NOBODY WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT  THAT IF I DID NOT BRING IT UP. I TALKED I TALKED ABOUT THE WALL -- THE WALL.  YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.   WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL. AND MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL.  OK? I WILL TELL YOU THAT. JUST LIKE YOU ARE STANDING HERE,  10,000 PEOPLE AT LEAST, JUST  LIKE YOU STANDING HERE, MEXICO  WILL PAY FOR THE WALL. THEY UNDERSTAND IT, YOU UNDERSTAND IT. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE STRONG BORDERS AND WE ARE GOING TO STOP  DRUGS FROM POURING IN. BY THE WAY, POURING IN -- I WAS JUST BACKSTAGE AT A REPORTER WAS  TELLING ME HOW HEROIN IS  POISONING AREOUR YOUTH. WE ARE GOING TO STOP IT. WE CANNOT LET IT GO ON LIKE  THIS. I CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR AND I  SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS  SOMETHING I HAVE TO DO. RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT -- NOT  EASY, NOT EASY. ALTHOUGH, I'M ENJOYING IT. WE ARE HAVING A GOOD, GOOD TIME. I LOVE YOU, TOO. I LOVE THIS GUY. I LOVE THIS GUY WHOEVER HE IS. SO, I TALKED ABOUT TRADE, IMMIGRATION, A LOT OF THINGS.  MY FOCUS WAS TRADE AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. WHAT HAPPENED IS IT TOOK OFF.  WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS IS HAPPENING NOW? WE ARE LEADING IN THE POLLS BY A  LOT. LYIN'TED CRUZ HAS GONE WAY DOWN. WHOA. HE'S GONE DOWN. KASICH WAS IN FAVOR OF NAFTA. NAFTA HAS KILLED CONNECTICUT. IT HAS KILLED HARTFORD. IT HAS KILLED BIG PARTS OF OUR  COUNTRY. YOU CANNOT HAVE PEOPLE AND YOU CANNOT VOTE FOR PEOPLE WHO VOTED  IN FAVOR OF NAFTA.  IT IS NO GOOD. IT IS NO GOOD. SO, I STARTED OFF WITH ILLEGAL  IMMIGRATION AND TRADE. LET ME TELL YOU -- LET'S TALK  TRADE BECAUSE CONNECTICUT MORE  THAN ANYTHING ELSE. BOY, DO YOU NEED JOBS. WE NEED JOBS. WE ARE GOING TO BRING JOBS BACK  IN. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE THE DUMMIES THAT LOSE ALL OF OUR  JOBS. WE ARE GOING TO BE THE SMART  ONES. THERE IS ONE OF THE DUMMIES. GET HIM OUT OF HERE.  GET HIM OUT. THERE IS NOTHING MORE FUN THAN A TRUMP RALLY. NOTHING. GET HIM OUT. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. LOOK. DO WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY?  ARE WE GOING TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK? ARE WE NOT GOING TO BE THIS  STUPID PEOPLE ANYMORE? WE ARE LED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE GROSSLY INCOMPETENT. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE  DOING. MILITARILY, WE CANNOT BEAT ISIS. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE NO  CLUE. THAT IS GOING TO END, FOLKS, IT  IS GOING TO END.  IT IS GOING TO END RIGHT AFTER THIS ELECTION. IT IS GOING TO END. LET ME TELL YOU, WHEN I CAME DOWN, I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO? GO AHEAD. USA, YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.   WHEN I CAME DOWN -- I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS IN NEW YORK. I WAS AT LONG ISLAND YESTERDAY. I JUST LEFT UPSTATE NEW YORK. IT IS BEING DEVASTATED BY JOB  LOSS. I KNOW, HARTFORD VERY  WELL.  I LOVE CONNECTICUT. I KNOW WE HAVE PROBLEMS. WE LOST GENERAL ELECTRIC. HOW DO YOU LOSE GENERAL  ELECTRIC?  I MEAN, IT DOES NOT HELP YOU  FOLKS MUCH. AT LEAST WE LOST THEM TO THE  UNITED STATES. ONE OF THE FEW. THIS DOES NOT HELP YOU TOO MUCH,  BUT YOU CANNOT LOSE GENERAL  ELECTRIC. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I WILL SAY THIS -- IF I WERE GOVERNOR, I WOULD NOT BE LOSING  GENERAL ELECTRIC. THAT I CAN TELL YOU, THAT I CAN  TELL YOU. SO, SINCE 2000, I SAID GIVE ME SOME STATS BECAUSE I WANT TO  HAVE ACCURATE -- THIS IS RIGHT  OUT OF THE BOOK. SINCE 2000, THE NUMBER OF FOODS  THAT RECIPIENTS IN HARTFORD COUNTY, CONNECTICUT HAS INCREASED BY 54,000 PEOPLE. IT IS AN INCREASE OF 150%. WE NEED JOBS, WHEN HE JOBS. E NEED JOBS. THE ECONOMY OF THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT HAS EXPERIENCED ABSOLUTE DEVASTATION HAVING TO  DO WITH MANUFACTURING. WE KNOW THAT. I DID NOT HAVE TO GET A REPORT  TO TELL YOU THAT.  I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT. THERE WERE 300-7000  PEOPL IN,000 PEOPLE  EMPLOYED. NOW THERE ARE 159,000.  DID HAS BEEN CUT INIT HAS BEEN CUT IN HALF.  IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT, WE ARE  BRINGING OUR COMPANIES BACK  AND BRINGING OUR JOBS BACK.  THERE HAS BEEN A CUT -- THIS IS TERRIBLE -- A CUT OF 30% IN  CONNECTICUT MANUFACTURING JOBS  SINCE ONLY THE YEAR 2000. BY THE WAY, INCIDENTALLY, THAT  HAPPENS TO BE THE YEAR CHINA ENTERED THE WORLD TRADE.  THAT IS REALLY WHEN IT CAME IN. YOU KNOW WHAT? NO GOOD. CRUZ, LYIN' TED CRUZ.  DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS? CRUZ. HE SUPPORTS CURRENCY CHEATING BY CHINA BECAUSE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE BY DEVLAALUING THEIR  CURRENCY -- THEY ARE NOT  SUPPOSED TO BE DOING -- IT MAKES  IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR COMPANIES TO COMPETE WITH CHINESE COMPANIES. WE ARE GOING TO STOP IT. CRUZ WANTS IT TO GO WANT BECAUSE SOMEBODY PROBABLY REPRESENTING  INTEREST IN CHINA SAYS THIS IS  WHAT WE WANT.  LET ME TELL YOU, FOLKS, I'M SELF FUDNDING. THEY ARE NOT. THEY ARE BEING FUNDED BY  COMPANIES, COUNTRIES. THEY ARE GOING TO GO WHERE THE MONEY IS, NOT WHERE YOU ARE. REMEMBER THAT, BELIEVE ME. I HAVE BEEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF  THAT EQUATION FOR A LONG TIME. I HAVE BEEN A POLITICIAN -- I  HATE SAYING IT FOR NINE MONTHS,  BUT WE ARE DOING PRETTY WELL,  RIGHT?  THE LABOR FORCE IN CONNECTICUT TODAY IS 10,000 PEOPLE SMALLER THAN 2011. THAT IS A LOT OF PEOPLE. WE ARE HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. I CAN GO ON AND ON. NO GOOD. MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME WAY, WAY  DOWN. FOLKS, WE NEED A CHANGE BUT NOT  AN OBAMA CHANGE. WE DON'T NEED HILLARY CLINTON  WHO IS A DISASTER. WE DON'T NEED HILLARY CLINTON. HILLARY CLINTON IS A JOKE. HILLARY CLINTON --  HILLARY CLINTON -- NOTHING ABOUT TRADE, NOTHING ABOUT BUSINESS EXCEPT GETTING BUSINESS AND  MONEY INTO HER OWN ACCOUNT USING  WHAT SHE HAS GOT TO GET IT IN. REMEMBER WHEN SHE SAID SHE WAS POOR AND HAD NO MONEY AND SHE HAD TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS? SHE IS A LIAR, WOULDN'T YOU SAY? I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN USE THE SAME TERM. YOU ONLY HAVE ONE LYIN' TED. I DON'T THINK WE CAN USE THE  SAME TERM FOR HILLARY. HILLARY CLINTON HAS NEVERIS NOT  GOING TO BRING JOBS BACK TO THIS  COUNTRY. WALL STREET OWNS HILLARY  CLINTON.  WALL STREET, REMEMBER. I AGREE WITH BERNIE SANDERS -- I  AGREE TWICE.  I AGREE THERE. I'M NO FAN OF BERNIE SANDERS. I AGREE ON TWO THINGS -- HILLARY  CANNOT DO IT. I AGREE WITH HIM ON SOMETHING  VERY IMPORTANT. HE FEELS FOREIGN TRADE DEALS ARE  A DISASTER. HE CANNOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND. BASICALLY, HE IS A COMMUNIST.  WHAT THE HECK? EVERY GOING TO HAVE A ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A COMMUNIST?  THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED.  THE TOP REPUBLICANS SAID DONALD,  CAN YOU STOP SAYING THAT? I'M TELLING THE TRUTH, I DON'T CARE.  WE ARE CHANGING THE SYSTEM. ALL OF THESE BOSSES HAVE PICKED  DELEGATES -- I'M LEAVING BY  HUNDREDS WITH DELEGATES. I'M LEADING BY MILLIONS WITH VOTES. HILLARY CLINTON SAID I HAVE MORE VOTES THAN TRUMP. I HAVE BEEN RUNNING AGAINST 17 PEOPLE. SHE IS RUNNING AGAINST ONE, OK? IF I WAS RUNNING AGAINST FOUR OR FIVE, I WOULD HAVE MILLIONS OF MORE VOTES THAN HILLARY CLINTON. WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY IS AMAZING  BECAUSE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF  PEOPLE ARE COMING IN THAT DID NOT COME IN FOUR YEARS AGO WITH ROMNEY WHO LET US DOWN. HE CHOKED. HE CHOKED. HE WAS GAGGING. WE HAVE A LOT OF ATHLETES. YOU KNOW, THE GAG? HE WAS GAGGING. WE HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE RIGHT NOW, MILLIONS MORE COMING INTO  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. 70%. IN TERMS OF VOTES, THE DEMOCRATS  ARE DOWN 35%.  THINK OF IT.  THE REPUBLICANS WANTED TO PLAY CUTE.  IF I DON'T MAKE IT, YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE BILLIONS OF PEOPLE  THAT DON'T MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GOING TO VOTE BECAUSE THEY ARE TIRED OF THE REPUBLICANS, THE POLITICIANS. ALL TALK, NO ACTION. THEY HAVE TOTALLY HAD IT. YOU CAN HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE  THAT ARE NOT GOING TO VOTE AND HOPEFULLY THAT IS ALL. THEY ARE VERY, VERY ANGRY AND DISENFRANCHISED. WE HAVE A RIGGED SYSTEM ON TOP OF IT. DESPITE THAT, WE CAN GET THERE  BEFORE THE CONVENTION. I THINK WE DO.  SO, I BUILT A GREAT BUSINESS AND  I FILED MY PAPERS. THESE ARE THE MOST DISHONEST HUMAN BEINGS YOU WILL EVER MEET,  THE REPORTERS.  THE MOST DISHONEST. THE MEDIA, THE MEDIA. THE MOST DISHONEST.  THE ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT THE PROTESTERS, I CALL THEM AGITATORS BECAUSE MOST OF THEM  ARE PAID. WE DON'T HAVE ANY IN HARTFORD,  BUT APPLE SAY THISI WILL SAY THIS -- I  WILL PUT THEM IN DIFFERENT CORNERS BECAUSE THE ONLY TIME  THE CAMERAS WILL SHOW THESE MASSIVE CROWDS, THE ONLY TIME IS  WHEN THERE IS TROUBLE. MEANING A LITTLE BIT OF A  PROTEST THE RAISES THEIR HAND  AND SAYS SOMETHING.  I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT. THEY DON'T TELL THE STORY.  THEY DON'T TELL THE STORY.  YOU KNOW, IT IS FUNNY.  I 'VE HAVE THE BIGGEST CROWDS. LAST NIGHT OR THE NIGHT BEFORE,  BERNIE SANDERS IN NEW YORK, THEY  SAID HE HAS 27,000.  BELIEVE ME, THAT WAS NOT 27. WHEN TRUMP HAS A CROWD, THEY  WILL SAY, WE ARE HERE WITH DONALD TRUMP. THEY DON'T REPORT WHAT IS GOING ON. LOOK, SOME ARE HONEST, BUT THEY  DON'T REPORT THE KIND OF CROWDS -- THEY DON'T RECORD, REPORT IT. BERNIE ALWAYS HAS BIG CROWDS. I HAVE MUCH BIGGER CROWD THAN HE DOES.  THEY DON'T WANT TO REPORT IT. WE HAVE A MOVEMENT GOING ON THE  LIKES OF WHICH NOBODY HAS EVER  SEEN IN THIS COUNTRY.   PEOPLE ARE FED UP. THEY ARE DISGUSTED. THEY ARE DISGUSTED WITH OBAMACARE. THEY ARE DISGUSTED WITH EVERY SINGLE THING THAT IS HAPPENING  TO US IN OUR COUNTRY. WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE. WE LOSE THAT EVERY SINGLE FACET. GET HIM OUT OF HERE. OUT. OUT.  GET HIM OUT. GET HIM OUT. THEY JUST WANT TO BE ON TELEVISION FOR TWO SECONDS, THAT  IS ALL. I ALWAYS SAY DON'T HURT THAT  PERSON, RIGHT? DON'T HURT THAT PERSON. SO, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT -- ANOTHER THEY. TRUMP RALLIES ARE AMONG THE SAFEST PLACES TO BE ON EARTH. IT IS TRUE. WE DON'T HEAR THAT. BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM  LOVE EACH OTHER AND THEY PROTECT EACH OTHER AND THAT IS WHAT WE  HAVE TO DO AS A COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO PROTECT EACH OTHER  AND THAT MEANS EVERYTHING. RIGHT NOW, WE ARE UNDIVIDED  COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO BRING OUR COUNTRY  BACK AND BE INCLUSIVE AND THAT  MEANS EVERYBODY. BUT WE HAVE THE SAFEST PLACES  THAT YOU WILL EVER BE. I SEE IT ALL THE TIME. IF ONE PERSON RAISES THEIR HAND,  THE NEXT DAY HEADLINES -- ""T RUMP'S PROTESTER."" I LOVE OUR LOYAL PEOPLE. THERE ARE NO PEOPLE LIKE OUR  PEOPLE.  SO, IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO US FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT, WE HAVE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT WHICH IS  PRACTICALLY ZERO. IF CHINA HAD PRACTICALLY ZERO,  THEY WOULD HAVE A REVOLUTION. CHINA GOES DOWN TO 7%, 8% AND IT  IS A BIG DEAL AND THERE IS  TURMOIL. WE ARE PRACTICALLY AT ZERO, MEANING WE HAVE NOTHING GOING. WHEN I COME UP TO HARTFORD -- WHEN I GO UP TO NEW YORK STATE AND I LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE EMPTY BUILDINGS THAT USED TO HAVE JOBS, WORKERS, GREAT COMPANIES AND THOSE COMPANIES HAVE LEFT FOR MEXICO AND OTHER PLACES -- WHEN I SEE THE KIND OF BUSINESS  THAT CHINA IS TAKING OUT -- CHINA HAS HAD 5 -- THINK OF IT. 500 AND$505 BILLION -- A DEFICIT. WE HAVE A DEFICIT WITH MEXICO OF $58 BILLION.  WE HAVE A MASSIVE DEFICIT WITH  JAPAN AND VIETNAM AND EVERY  SINGLE COUNTRY VIRTUALLY THAT WE  DO BUSINESS WITH.  WE HAVE AN IN COMPETENT OR CROOKED  PEOPLE MAKING DEALS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT  ANYMORE, FOLKS.  IT IS OVER, IT IS OVER. YOU KNOW -- GET HIM OUT.  GET HIM OUT. DON'T HURT HIM. SEE HOW NOWICE I AM? I SAY GET HIM OUT! AND THEN I GO, DON'T HURT HIM,  DON'T HURT HIM. OK, GET HIM OUT. NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT. THEY REALLY IMPEDE FREEDOM OF  SPEECH AND IT IS A DISGRACE. THE GOOD NEWS IS, FOLKS, IT WILL  NOT BE LONG. IT WON'T BE LONG. RECENTLY, THEY SAID WHAT DO YOU  THINK OF NATO? NOW, I NEVER STUDIED NATO BUT IT IS OBSOLETE AND THE UNITED  STATES IS PAYING TOO MUCH. YEAH, GET HIM OUT, THANK YOU. GET HIM OUT.  GET HIM OUT. AREN'T. YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST PROBLEM  WITH THESE PROTESTERS IS US. MAY HAVETHEY HAVE NOTHING. THE SIGNS ARE BEAUTIFULLY  MANUFACTURED AND HANDED TO THEM  AND THEY SAY WHY ARE YOU HERE?  WHY ARE YOU HERE? THE PRESS WAS SAYING. THE PERSON SAID I DON'T KNOW. I WAS TOLD TO BE. WHY ARE YOU PROTESTING AGAINST TRUMP? I THINK SO, YEAH. THIS IS SUCH A CON JOB BEING  PLACED ON THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.  IT IS A TOTAL AND COMPLETE CON JOB. THE WORST IS THIS -- THEY HAVE  NO VOICE -- THEY RAISE THEIR  VOICE. DON'T KEEP POINTING TO THEM  BECAUSE WE MAKE MORE NOISE THAN THEY DO. THERE IS NO PROBLEM. WE END AND UPUP MAKING THE  NOISE. THE POOR PERSON DOES NOT EVEN  KNOW WHY THEY ARE THERE.  THAT DON'T HAVE A CLUE. HERE IS THE STORY -- WE ARE  GOING TO BRING JOBS BACK TO OUR  COUNTRY.  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A STRONG  BORDER. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET CARRIER AIR-CONDITIONING MOVED TO MEXICO, MAKE  AIR-CONDITIONING, FIRE PEOPLE  THAT WERE THERE FOR YEARS AND  YEARS.  I'M A BIG BUYER OF CARRIER  PRODUCTS. I WILL NOT BUY THEM ANYMORE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET CARRIER  MOVED TO MEXICO. DON'T MAKE ANY NOISE, FOLKS. THAT IS OK. JUST NICE AND EASY. NICE AND EASY. IS THIS THE GREATEST PLACE ON  EARTH TO BE RIGHT HERE?  THE GREATEST. GET HIM OUT. WHEN I FIRST STARTED THIS -- I  USED TO GET ANGRY AT THE  PROTESTERS. I WOULD SAY GET HIM OUT OF HERE! AND THEN THE PRESS WOULD SAY IT  WAS HORRIBLE THE WAY MR. TRUMP BEHAVED. HE WAS SO MEAN AND NASTY. THE NEXT DAY WE HAD A PROTEST  AND I SAID PLEASE GET HIM OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? THEY SAID HE IS GETTING WEAKER. THAT WAS NO GOOD EITHER. GET HIM OUT. LOOK AT THOSE CAMERAS THE WAY THEY ARE ALL TURNED. LOOK AT THOSE CAMERAS. OH, THEY ARE SO DISHONEST. SO DISHONEST. GET HIM OUT.  GET HIM OUT. GO HOME TO MOMMY. GO ALONE. HOME. I'M TELLING YOU -- MOST OF THEM  DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THEY ARE HERE.  WHEN THESE GUYS -- THEY DON'T  EVEN SHOW IT -- BUT WHEN THEY  SHOW IT, THEY SAY WE DON'T  REALLY KNOW WHY WE ARE HERE. I ACTUALLY FEEL SORRY.  BRING BACK WHAT? OK. I WON'T SAY THAT. SO, FOLKS, YOU'RE GOING TO BE  VOTING VERY SOON. VERY SOON.  YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME, YOU HAVE  TO PROMISE ME YOU ARE GOING OUT AND GOING TO VOTE. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I WANT YOU, I WANT YOU. WE ARE GOING TO GET YOU. WE ARE GOING TO BRING IT BACK FAST. THEY USED TO SAY THE WORD SILENT MAJORITY. THIS IS NO LONGER A SILENT MAJORITY. THIS IS A MASSIVE, NOISY MAJORITY. WE ARE ON THE COVER OF ""TIME"" MAGAZINE ALL THE TIME. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET GO. NOBODY KNOWS POLITICIANS BETTER  THAN I DO. I WAS ESTABLISHMENT WILL MONTH AGO,12 MONTHS AGO, RIGHT? THEY ALWAYS LOVE YOU WHEN THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY.  NOW, I'M PROBABLY  ANTIESTABLISHMENT AS GOT EVER D EVER CREATED. I UNDERSTAND THE GAME BETTER THAN ANYBODY. I UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM AND THE  SYSTEM IS RIGGED. THE ECONOMY IS RIGGED, THE BANKS  ARE RIGGED. WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE IT  AROUND. WE ARE GOING TO BRING IT BACK. WE'RE GOING TO REALLY LOOK -- I'M LEADING AND DELEGATES BY A LOT, BUT THE DELEGATE SYSTEM IS A DISASTER THE WAY THEY COUNT. IT AS A DISASTER. NOT FAIR, NOT GOOD AND NOT GOOD FOR DEMOCRACY. IT IS NOT GOOD FOR WHAT WE STAND FOR. SO, WE ARE GOING TO WIN IT ANYWAY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE OUR 1237  ANY WAY.  BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, IT IS A  BAD SYSTEM AND A DANGEROUS SYSTEM BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ANGRY AS HELL ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON. THEY ARE ANGRY ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON. HERE IS THE STORY -- YOU ARE  GOING TO REMEMBER THIS EVENING. YOU ARE GOING TO GO HOME TO YOUR  WIFE, YOUR BOYFRIEND, WHOEVER YOU ARE GOING ON TO. WHATEVER IT IS, ENJOY YOURSELF,  OK? YOU ARE GOING TO SAY THAT WAS A GREAT EVENING. YOU ARE GOING TO GO VERY  SHORTLY, NOT THIS TUESDAY BUT RIGHT AFTER, YOU WILL GO BECAUSE  NEW YORK IS LOOKING  FANTASTICALLY. NEW YORK IS LOOKING BIG, BIG LEAD. BIG, BIG POLL NUMBERS. THEA POLL CAME OUT NATIONWIDE --  HE IS GONE, BUT LYIN' TED CRUZ  IS LIKE THIS. LYIN' TED. WHAT A LIAR. LYIN' TED.  DID YOU EVERT SEE -- HE WALKS  INTO A ROOM WITH HIS BIBLE HELD  HIGH. LYIN' TED, FOLKS. REMEMBER WHAT HE DID TO BEN  CARSON? BEN CARSON WHO ENDORSED ME. AND CHRIS CHRISTIE WHO ENDORSED ME. BUT, BEN CARSON DURING THE  ELECTION IN IOWA -- DURING THE ELECTION, HE SPREAD THE WORD  THAT BEN CARSON HAD LEFT THE RACE ANY TOLD EVERYBODY'S COME VOTE FOR HIM. RIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION, HE APOLOGIZED AND SAID HE DID NOT  KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  HE IS LYIN' TED, BUT HE IS GOING  LIKE THIS. HE IS DROPPING LIKE A ROCK IN  THE POLLS. YOU KNOW, WHEN HE GOES BACK IN THE POLLS, HE IS LIKE A BASKET CASE.  WATCH WHAT HAPPENS.  WATCH HOW BADLY WE BEAT HIM AND  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF FUN DOING IT, FOLKS. HERE'S THE STORY -- I LOVE BEING  WITH YOU.  I HAVE LIVED IN THIS STATE AND I  KNOW THIS DATE AND I HAVE SOME  OF THE GREATEST FRIENDS FROM THE  STATE.  A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE IN HARTFORD. EXCEPT INSURANCE COMPANIES CHARGE ME TOO MUCH MONEY WHICH I HATE. OUR COUNTRY DOES NOT WIN  ANYMORE. WE DON'T WIN WITH MILITARY, ON THE BORDERS, HEALTH CARE, WE  DON'T WIN WITH OUR SECOND AMENDMENT WHICH BY THE WAY WILL BE 100% PROTECTED BY ME.  YOU KNOW WHAT? WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING. WHEN YOU CAST YOUR VOTE IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME -- YOU HAVE  TO PROMISE ME. DOES EVERYBODY PROMISE? WE ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR TRUMP. AND IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR TRUMP, DON'T BOTHER GOING. WE ARE GOING TO TURN OUR COUNTRY AROUND. YOU WERE GOING TO LOOK BACK IN  TWO YEARS, FOUR YEARS, 20 YEARS -- WE WILL LOOK AT YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND SAY THAT WAS THE GREATEST VOTE I HAVE EVER CAST. THAT IS WHEN AMERICA BECAME  GREAT AGAIN. THAT IS WHEN WE STARTED WINNING  AGAIN. THAT IS WHEN WE WON WITH OUR MILITARY. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE DOWN ISIS  FAST. THAT IS WHEN WE STARTED WINNING ON TRADE. THAT IS WHEN WE ENDED COMMON  CORE AND BROADERUGHT OUR EDUCATION BACK.

MR. TRUMP: THANK YOU EVERYBODY. GREAT TO BE BACK IN NEW YORK, I WILL SAY THAT. GREAT TO BE BACK.  WHAT A CROWD.  YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT WOULD DO   SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT.  WHEN ED CALLED ME A FEW MONTHS   AGO AND SAID WE WOULD LOVE FOR   YOU TO SPEAK.  I SAID WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO  HAVE IT? HE SAID AT THE GRAND HYATT. I SAID I WOULD LOVE TO SPEAK THERE BECAUSE I BUILT THE HOTEL. IT WAS A SUCCESSFUL DEAL AND IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE   1970'S AND THE MARKET WAS HORRIBLE AND THIS AREA FOR THOSE OF YOU LIKE MY GOOD FRIEND,  EVERYBODY WOULD SAY THIS WAS A   CRAZY DEAL AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE  DONE IT AND I SAID I HAVE TO DO  IT. AND MY FATHER, WHO WAS IN BROOKLYN AND QUEENS SAID SON, WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MANHATTAN. DON'T DO IT. I SAID POP, I WANT TO BE IN MANHATTAN. I AGREE THE LOCATION IS  TERRIBLE.  YOU HAD TO SEE THE PEOPLE. THAT WAS ONE I HAVE TO SAY REPUBLICANS FOR GERALD FORD SAID TO NEW YORK, DROP DEAD.  DROP DEAD. THAT WAS A KILLER. NOT A GOOD TIME FOR OUR CITY. IT WAS A BAD TIME FOR OUR CITY, BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS -- WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE   WE LOVE NEW YORK.  WE LOVE NEW YORK AND THAT WAS PROBABLY MAYBE THE WORST OF THE WORST. BUT I JUST WANTED TO DO IT. I LOVE THE BUILDING AND THE  POTENTIAL OF THE BUILDING. CALLED THE COMMODORE HOTEL BUILT IN 1909 AND IT WAS A MESS. AND THEY HAD A SPA AND IT WAS CALLED RELAXATION PLUS. AND NOBODY EVER GOT INTO WHAT  THE PLUS MEANT.  YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.   MR. TRUMP: EVERY RETAIL CENTER   IN THE BUILDING WAS FAILING. BUT RELAXATION PLUS WAS MAKING   AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE AND I  COULDN'T GET THEM OUT. AND I ASKED ABOUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS.  I SHOULDN'T SAY THIS TOO LOUD  BECAUSE I WILL RIDICULED BY THE CONSERVATIVES, OF WHICH I AM   ONE. I SAID WHAT ABOUT CONDEMNATION?  EVERYBODY HAPPY I DIDN'T DO THAT.  I ENDED UP GETTING THEM OUT AND BROUGHT THE BUILDING DOWN TO ITS STEEL EXCEPT FOR THE DETAILS ON  A COUPLE OF THE CEILINGS BECAUSE -- THIS IS ONE OF THE ROOMS  HERE. THE DETAIL OF THE BALLROOM AND   THE DETAIL OF THE ROOMS OUTSIDE AND TRYING TO SAVE THOSE COST A FORTUNE BECAUSE WHEN THE   BUILDING WAS BROUGHT TO THE  STEEL WE HAD TO PUT CANVASS OVER IT AND IT WASN'T AN EASY   SITUATION. AND I GOT IT BUILT AND AS WE WERE OPENING, THE MARKET CHANGED BECAUSE THE CITY WAS DOING SO  BADLY AND THAT WAS THE WORST   THAT THE CITY HAD BEEN   ECONOMICALLY. PEOPLE AND COMPANIES WERE  LEAVING IN DROVES AND IT WAS   SOMETHING OF A MIRACLE. THE AREA.  I OPENED THE BUILDING TO TREMENDOUS FANFARE AND THE AREA  BECAME SPECIAL.  AND I CALLED IT A PARK AVENUE  ADDRESS. I CALLED IT PARK AVENUE. IT'S ON THE PARK AVENUE RAMP.  MIGHT NOT BE PURE PARK.  I HAD A CHOICE OF LEXINGTON AVENUE, 42ND STREET OR PARK  AVENUE.  AND GUESS WHAT? I CHOSE PARK AVENUE. THAT WASN'T BAD. I HAD THAT IN COLUMBUS CIRCLE. I DID THE BIG HOTEL, TRUMP INTERNATIONAL AND BEEN A GREAT   SUCCESS AND WE'RE IN THE CIRCLE. AND COLUMBUS CIRCLE DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD NAME, BUT IT WAS ALSO ON  CENTRAL PARK WEST, BUT CALLED 7  COLUMBUS CIRCLE. AND A LITTLE KNOWN FACT, AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT GOVERNMENT  AND RULES AND REGULATIONS, A   LITTLE KNOWN FACT WHEN YOU HAVE AN ADDRESS IN NEW YORK, IT'S   VERY, VERY HARD, SO HARD TO  CHANGE.  SO WHEN YOU HAVE A BUILDING THAT IS 7 COLUMBUS CIRCLE, YOU HAVE   TO GO THROUGH THE UNITED STATES  GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF THE MAIL SERVICE AND U.S. MAIL AND ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PROBLEMS.  SO IT WAS 7 COLUMBUS AND I   STRIPPED THAT ONE DOWN.  WE BUILT A TREMENDOUS BUILDING.  I SAID YAME NOT DOING IT AND I   PUT A BIG CAMPAIGN IN WASHINGTON AND GOT IT CHANGED TO NUMBER 1 CENTRAL PARK WEST. AND THE DAY I GOT THAT CHANGED, THE BUILDING WAS WORTH SEVEN TIMES WORTH MORE THAN I PAID FOR IT. THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING EVENT THRKS BUILDING. I THINK OF IT BECAUSE WHEN I DID THE BUILDING, EVERYBODY SAID   DON'T DO IT. CAN'T BE DONE. NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. BAD AREA, BAD LOCATION,  TREMENDOUS CRIME.  THE CITY'S DYING AND THE CITY WAS DYING. IT WASN'T JUST LIKE NOT DOING  WELL, BUT THE CITY WAS DEAD. AND I SAID TO A FRIEND OF MINE WHO WAS IN A GOOD BUSINESS AND   HE BECAME A FRIEND AND I SAID  I'M IN THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS  IN NEW YORK AND HE SAID, THAT'S  TOO BAD. BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE A GREAT  BUSINESS AND TURNED OUT TO BE A  GREAT SUCCESS AS A HOTEL AND   HYATT WAS MY PARTNER AND WE DID  A GOOD JOB AND FROM THE TIME IT  OPENED, IT WAS AMAZING, FROM THE DAY IT OPENED THAT'S THE WAY THE MARKET CHANGED. I BOUGHT THE TALLEST BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN AND BOUGHT IT LITERALLY DURING THE DEPRESSION  OF THE EARLY 1990'S AND PAID   VERY LITTLE FOR IT. NOBODY WANTED IT AND WHEN IT   OPENED, IT WAS LIKE THE WORLD  CHANGED AND BECAME A   TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL  BUILDING, WHICH I STILL HAVE. BUT WITH THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR, WHEN I DID IT, PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT IT. ESPECIALLY MY FATHER. MY FATHER WAS THE MAN WHO TAUGHT ME THE MOST AND LOANED ME A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY AND BUILT IT INTO A GREAT, GREAT COMPANY AND THIS BECAME SO SUCCESSFUL  AND HE SAID WOW! PAID HIM BACK THE MONEY. WE DID OTHER THINGS, WE DID THE CONVENTION CENTER. I GOT THE STATE AND CITY TO  BUILD AND TO THIS DAY AND GOING  TO BUILD THAT ONE IN THE WATER AND HAD ENVIRONMENTAL APROVALS. EVEN THEN THEY HAD ENVIRONMENTAL APROVALS. AND THEY WERE IN THE WRONG LOCATION.  I WENT TO GOVERNOR CAREY AND HE WAS A GREAT PROBLEM SOLVER AND   WASTING -- AND COULDN'T GET APPROVAL. WE HAD A MAN AND HE WAS TOTALLY AGAINST WHAT I WAS DOING AND HE WAS WANTING TO BUILD IT IN ONE   LOCATION. YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH HELL'S   KITCHEN AND WEST SIDE HIGHWAY,   RAMPS OVER THE HIGHWAY AND IT  WAS BEING BUILT INTO THE HUDSON RIVER. OTHER THAN THAT, IT WAS A WONDERFUL SITE.  THIS GUY, I WON'T MENTION HIS  NAME, RICHARD RAVITZ. HE WAS SO INTENT ON BUILDING IT  AND I WAS ARGUING WITH HIM AND FIGHTING.  AND I SAID I HAVE OPTIONS TO THE WEST SIDE RAILROAD YARDS AND I DN IT WITH THE PENN CENTRAL RAILROAD.  THE SITE IS GREAT. WE WENT UP TO GOVERNOR CAREY AND HE APPOINTED THIS COMMISSION TO BUILD THE CONVENTION CENTER AND  THEY WERE JUST ABOUT STARTING. AND I SAT DOWN WITH GOVERNOR CAREY AND HIS STAFF AND HE SAID RICHARD, YOU MAKE THE CASE FOR YOUR SITE. AND MADE THE CASE FOR 20 MINUTES AND EVERY TIME HE TALKED IT WAS WRONG, WRONG, WRONG. HE SAID DONALD, WILL YOU MAKE  THE CASE. IT TOOK ME FIVE MINUTES. TOTALLY CHANGED GEARS. GOT IT, GOT THE APPROVALS. AND TO THIS DAY GREAT. SO WE'RE HAPPY ABOUT IT.   THEB I BUILT MANY OTHER BUILD -- THEN I BUILT MANY OTHER BUILDINGS ACROSS THE CITY. THIS WAS MY FIRST. THE GRAND HYATT HOTEL. AND SEVEN YEARS THE CITY   COULDN'T FIX AN ICE SKATING RINK.  I BECAME MORE FAMOUS BECAUSE OF  THAT RINK. THEY COULDN'T GUILD IT FOR SEVEN YEARS AND I HAD MY DAUGHTER -- DID ANYBODY HEAR OF IVANKA AND KEPT SAYING, DADDY, DADDY CAN'T WE GO ICE SKATING? I WENT DOWN AND LOOKED AND SAW 400 MEN, IN THOSE CASES IT WAS MEN, TODAY YOU HAVE MEN AND  WOMEN AS CONSTRUCTION PEOPLE, 400 MEN SITTING IN THE RINK NOT LOOKING AND I CAME BACK HALF AN HOUR LATER AND STILL WEREN'T WORKING. TAKING LUNCH BREAKS MANY, MANY TIMES A DAY. AND THEY WENT OUT AND GOT FROM   MIAMI BEACH AN EXPERT ON ICE.  BUT THEY MEANT REFRIGERATORS, NOT TO MAKE ICE. I HOPE THIS IS AN INTERESTING STORY. WHO THE HELL WANTS TO TALK ABOUT POLITICS ALL THE TIME. POLITICS GETS A LITTLE BORING. BUT WHAT HAPPENED IS I WENT TO THE MAYOR AND I SAID, ED KOCH. IT'S SEVEN YEARS NOW AND EIGHT, NINE, 10 AND THEY USE A GAS THAT GOES THROUGH COPPER TUBING.  FOUR INCHES APART AND IT WAS   LAID -- THIS MASSIVE RINK, 90,000 SQUARE RINK.  BIG OFFICE FLOORS TIMES THREE. I HAVE RUN IT FOR MANY YEARS.  IT HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS PLACE. BUT THEY HAD THE FREEON AND FOUR INCHES, MILES OF IT AND EVERY  TIME THEY PUT THE BEAUTIFUL  COPPER DOWN, EVERY SINGLE TIME,  THE NEXT NIGHT, PEOPLE WOULD   STEEL IT.  KEPT PUTTING IT DOWN, KEPT GETTING IT STOLEN. UNTIL THE POLICE FORCE DECIDED   TO GO TO LUNCH, IT WAS ALL   STOLEN.  THEY WERE LOSING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, $22 MILLION.  AND I WENT TO SEE ED KOCH. AND THEN I WENT TO SEE SOME OF   THE NEWSPAPERS AND EDITORIAL   BOARDS.  I SAID I WILL DO IT IN SIX   MONTHS TO A YEAR AND YOU ARE   GOING TO BE YEARS AND YEARS AND  DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND SPENDING A FORTUNE.  I WENT TO TWO EDITORIAL BOARDS,  ""NEW YORK TIMES"" AND THE OTHER   ONE I WON'T SAY BECAUSE I DON'T  LIKE -- BUT I DO LIKE THE ""NEW   YORK POST."" AND THEY DID EDITORIALS. YOU HAVE TO LET HIM DO IT. I TOOK OVER THE PROJECT AND A  LOT OF PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BUILT. IT WASN'T BUILT. THE CONCRETE WAS POURED. IT WAS NINE INCHES HIGHER ON ONE SIDE THAN THE OTHER SIDE.  WHEN YOU POURED THE WATER, YOU   HAD A BIG SWIMMING POOL. AND THE WATER WAS SO DEEP YOU COULDN'T FREEZE IT.  I HAD TO RIP OUT THE ENTIRE SLAB AND IT WAS A FOOT AND A HALF   THICK. SO WE RIPPED IT AND I FINISHED IT IN FOUR MONTHS AND I SAID IF IT COSTS MORE THAN $2 MILLION -- THEY STUDIED THIS AT WHARTON SCHOOL AND HARVARD BECAUSE IT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE   PRIVATE SECTOR AND PUBLIC  SECTOR. TO THIS DAY, IT'S A GREAT CASE STUDY. I WENT IN AND DID A JOB LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. WE TOOK OUT THAT MASSIVE SLAB OF CONCRETE AND LEVELED IT OUT. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I SAID TO  THE PEOPLE THAT'S WITH THE FREEON AND LOSING COPPER PIPING. MIAMI, I DON'T WANT ICE FROM MIAMI. I WANTED A PART OWNER WHO OF THE MON TREIAL CANADIENS.  DO YOU HOW I CAN GET ICE?  HE SAID MR. TRUMP, FIVE MILES OF THIS PIPING, IF THERE IS A -- IT'S GAS, IF THERE IS A LITTLE   PIN HOLE IN FIVE MILES, YOU DON'T WANT THAT. YOU WANT RUBBER HOSE AND IN THE  WATER, YOU PUT SALT SO IT  DOESN'T FREEZE.  I SAID BOY, THAT SOUNDS GOOD. AND I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT IT FOR A TINY AMOUNT OF MONEY. RUBBER HOSE EVERY FOUR INCHES. THEY CALL IT BRIAN.  AND WE DID THE RUBBER HOSE.  NOBODY WANTED IT. WE DIDN'T NEED SECURITY. NOBODY SOLD THE RUBBER HOSE. AND WE OPENED IT UP AND MOST AMAZING THING. WE TESTED AND WASN'T A LEAK IN THE WHOLE THING. 6.2 MILES OF RUBBER HOSE. NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE PUT THE CONCRETE OVER. WE HAD CONCRETE TRUCKS LINED UP TO HARLEM. ALL OF MY CONSTRUCTION FRIENDS   IN THAT CORNER, THEY HAVE THE WORST SEATS, CONSTRUCTION GUYS   USUALLY HAVE THE BEST SEATS. THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, THE CITY USED TO POUR 10 FEET COME BACK AND POUR ANOTHER 10 FEET. YOU WANT IT CONTIGUOUS. BUT ALL THE WAY BACK TO HARLEM, WE HAD TRUCKS. AND THE MOST AMAZING THING, IT TOOK TWO DAYS TO POUR THE SLAB.  WE MADE IT SIX INCHES AND TWO  INCHES ON TOP OF THIS SLAB AND   IT WAS A PERFECT SLAB. TO THIS DAY, IT'S PERFECT. PUT THE WATER ON TOP. I SAID TRY IT. I SAID TRY IT AND IN TWO HOURS WE HAD THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ICE JUST LIKE THE MONTREAL CANADIENS.   I HAVE HAD A LOT OF   FUN WITH NEW YORK AND DID ANOTHER JOB IN THE BRONX, FERRY  POINT. THERE THEY ARE.  YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. FERRY POINT WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION FOR 26 YEARS. 26 YEARS. IT ENDED UP COSTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, NOBODY  KNOWS WHAT THE PRICE IS. AND MICHAEL BLOOMBERG SAID COULD YOU LOOK AT THIS.  IT'S BEEN A DISASTER. AND HE WAS EMBARRASSED.  AND IT'S A VERY GOLF PROJECT DESIGNED BY JACK NICKLAUS. BUT I GOT IT BUILT IN ONE YEAR   AND OPENED TODAY AND GREATLY SUCCESSFUL.  AND BY THE WAY, AND FOR PEANUTS. WHEN I SAY -- AM I RIGHT?  THAT'S THE WOMAN RIGHT THERE.  AM I RIGHT? THANK YOU, DARLING. I DON'T KNOW WHO THE HELL SHE  IS. SHE'S NOT A PROTESTOR, SHE'S ON MY SIDE. I TELL YOU WHAT. YOU LOOK OUTSIDE, THESE ARE PAID PROTESTORS, FOLKS. THEY HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SIGNS FROM A FACTORY.  IF YOU WANT INFORMATION ON A SIGN, CALL THIS NUMBER. IF THEY'RE REAL PROTESTORS, WE WANT THOSE SIGNS MADE IN THE BASEMENT.  WE HAVE DONE SO MANY JOBS SINCE THEN.  IT'S AN AMAZING CITY.  WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL. OUR MAYOR HAS TO BE CAREFUL,   BECAUSE HE CAN BLOW IT VERY  QUICKLY. NOT DOING GOOD.  BETTER BE CAREFUL, MR. MAYOR,  BUT WE HAVE A CITY THAT OUTLASTS EVERYBODY AND GOING TO OUTLAST   US. ONE OF THE GREAT, GREAT CITIES   OF THE WORLD AND IT'S CALLED NEW YORK CITY.   I THINK WHILE I'M AT  AT IT AND PROUD OF SO MANY OF THE JOBS AND MY PROJECTS.  JUST SO MANY GREAT EXPERIENCES   FROM NEW YORK. WE CAN DO THE SAME THING WITH OUR COUNTRY. WE CAN BRING THESE JOBS IN UNDER BUDGET INSTEAD OF 20 TIMES BUDGET.  WE NEED INFRASTRUCTURE.  WE NEED MORE MILITARY. OUR MILITARY IS BEING DISS   MATED. WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS AND DO SO MANY THINGS. WE CAN DO IT, SAME THING, ICE SKATING RINKS AND FERRY POINT. IT'S ALL THE SAME THING. DOING THE PENNSYLVANIA ON HOE  PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. THE G.S.A., TOTAL PROFESSIONALS, THE MOST COMPETITIVELY BID JOB.  EVERYBODY WANTED IT. THE OLD POST OFFICE. AND WE GOT IT. WE GOT IT BECAUSE OUR CONCEPT WAS GREAT AND OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENT IS GREAT.  AND NOW IT'S UNDER BUDGET AND  AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND GOING TO   OPEN IN SEPTEMBER, SUBSTANTIALLY MORE THAN A YEAR AHEAD OF  SCHEDULE AND WE'LL HAVE IT   OPENED IN SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR AS OPPOSED TO TWO YEARS FROM   THEN. IT WILL BE OPEN -- YOU'LL JOIN   ME. I WILL BE IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND YOU CAN STAY IN THE HOTEL, OK? [CHEERS AND  ONE OF THE REPORTERS  RECENTLY ASKED ME, THEY SAID, MR. TRUMP, IF YOU WIN THE PRESIDENCY, WILL YOU BE STAYING IN YOUR NEW HOTEL OR THE WHITE   HOUSE? I SAID I'LL TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT NEW YORK VALUES BECAUSE IT'S BECOME A BIG THING. I WROTE A FEW THINGS DOWN, BUT   IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS. I TALKED TONIGHT ABOUT NEW YORK  VALUES THAT WE ALL, MANY OF US,  THAT WE ALL KNOW SO WELL.  THE VALUES THAT MAKE US LOVE   THIS STATE, WHICH HAS BEEN A SYMBOL OF AMERICAN STRENGTH  THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, NO MATTER  WHERE YOU GO, THEY LOVE NEW  YORK.  YOU CAN BE FROM LOTS OF OTHER PLACES AND IF YOU WANT TO SEE  SOMEBODY, YOU SAY WHEN ARE YOU   COMING TO NEW YORK? THERE IS NOTHING LIKE IT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT VALUES, WHAT  DO WE SEE IN NEW YORK VALUES?  WE SEE A REALLY, INCREDIBLE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT SEPTEMBER 11 ESPECIALLY, NEW YORK POLICE AND  NEW YORK FIREFIGHTERS, INCREDIBLE.    WE SEE OUR UNBELIEVE  AND THEY KEEP THOSE TRAINS AND BUSES GOING AND EVERYTHING ELSE, BUT OUR TRANSIT WORKERS AND WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH ON SEPTEMBER 11 WAS INCREDIBLE.   WE SEE FAMILIES   PLAYING IN CENTRAL PARK. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WITH THEIR CHILDREN,  SOME WITHOUT CHILDREN, SOME TOGETHER, SOME NOT TOGETHER, BUT WE SEE PEOPLE IN CENTRAL PARK AND PEOPLE PLAYING IN CENTRAL PARK.  WE SEE RESTAURANT WORKERS ALL OVER THE CITY, DELIS AND FACTORY WORKERS IN UPSTATE NEW YORK AND  THOSE FACTORIES ARE RAPIDLY LEAVING OUR STATE AND WE CAN'T   LET THAT HAPPEN. AND WE HAVE A WHOLE FABRIC OF OUR COMMUNITY. SO WHAT ARE NEW YORK VALUES? BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DISPUTING -- I'M NOT DISPUTING AND MOST   PEOPLE WHO KNOW NEW YORK AND   WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND LOOK AT  WHAT HAPPENED AFTER SEPTEMBER  11, THE JOBS THAT THIS CITY HAS  DONE AND THE JOBS IS BEYOND WHAT ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN. AND YOU SAY, WHAT ARE NEW YORK VALUES?  NUMBER ONE, HONESTY AND STRAIGHT TALKING. HONESTY -- YOU BETTER BELIEVE  IT. IT'S A WORK ETHIC. HARDWORKING PEOPLE.  IT'S ABOUT FAMILIES. NEW YORK, BELIEVE IT, IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.  SO IMPORTANT. IT'S THE ENERGY TO GET THINGS DONE, BIG ENERGY. IF JEB BUSH CAME HERE, I'M TELLING YOU HE WOULD HAVE MUCH   MORE ENERGY THAN HE HAS RIGHT NOW. HE SHOULD MOVE TO NEW YORK, RIGHT? WE ARE BUILDERS. WE MAKE THINGS HAPPEN, IT'S SO   IMPORTANT. WE MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. AND IT'S COURAGE AND COMMUNITY SERVICE, BECAUSE THERE IS  TREMENDOUS COMMUNITY SERVICE.  NEW YORK VALUES WERE ON DISPLAY FOR ALL TO SEE IN THE AFTERMATH  OF 9/11 THAT STRUCK AT THE HEART OF OUR CITY AND OUR NATION. IN OUR DARKEST MOMENTS AS A CITY, WE SHOWED THE WORLD THE VERY, VERY BEST IN TERMS OF BRAVERY AND HEART AND SOUL THAT WE HAVE IN AMERICA.   THE FIREFIGHTERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS AND THE POLICE OFFICERS AND THE PORT AUTHORITY  WORKERS WHO RAN UP THOSE STAIRS, THOSE ARE NEW YORK VALUES AND THOSE ARE NEW YORKER VALUES. [SOMEONE SCREAMING IN BACKGROUND.  IS SHE SERIOUS. THE NEW YORK CITY CHAPLAIN WHO   DIED AND AN AMAZING GUY THAT I   KNEW A LITTLE BIT AND WHO RUDY   KNEW VERY WELL BUT LOOK AT FATHER JUDGE AND I TELL YOU  WHAT, HE WAS SOME GUY AND RAN UP THERE TO PRAY AND HE KNEW WHAT   WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND HE DIED AND HE DIED PRAYING AND TAKING   CARE OF PEOPLE AND HE WAS AN   AMAZING GUY. THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWERS THAT HELPED RESCUE EACH OTHER, THOSE  ARE THOSE OF NEW YORK VALUES.  THE RESTAURANTS AND LOCAL  BUSINESSES WHO KEPT THEIR SHOPS OPEN TO HELP EVERYBODY DURING  THIS INCREDIBLE TIME, THOSE ARE  NEW YORK VALUES. EVERYONE WHO HELPED CLEAR THE  RUBBLE AND THE RESCUE, THE   INJURED, THOSE ARE NEW YORK VALUES.  EVERY SMALL ACT OF KINDNESS,   EVERY GREAT ACT OF COURAGE OF  WHICH THERE WAS SO MANY, THERE   HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE   THIS. THIS WAS THE GREATEST AND MOST HORRIFIC ATTACK IN OUR COUNTRY, FAR GREATER THAN PEARL HARBOR  BECAUSE THE ATTACK WAS ON  CIVILIANS. BUT THOSE ARE NEW YORK VALUES. AND THESE ARE THE VALUES THAT WE NEED TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT   AGAIN. WE NEED THESE VALUES TO BRING AMERICA TOGETHER AGAIN AND TO HEAL AMERICA'S WOUNDS AGAIN. SO I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT  I AM SO PROUD TO BE WITH YOU   TONIGHT. I'M SO PROUD TO BE DISCUSSING ALL SORTS OF TOPICS, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY NEW YORK VALUES,   BECAUSE NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO   ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, THEY TALK IN A MOST POSITIVE TONE ABOUT WHAT ALL OF US HAVE DONE.  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HAVE A   GREAT DINNER AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN AMAZING ELECTION COMING UP.  WE ARE HAVING SOME REALLY GREAT PRIMARIES. IT'S ABOUT A LOT OF FUN. IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THIS  WAY. I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH   POLITICIANS ALL MY LIFE. IT HAS BEEN A GREAT EXPERIENCE. I'M MILLIONS OF VOTES AHEAD OF   MY CLOSEST RIVAL. THEY TALK DELEGATES. I HAPPEN TO BE HUNDREDS OF   DELEGATES AHEAD, TOO.  TO ME, IT'S SO IMPORTANT,  MILLIONS OF VOTES AHEAD. AND WE HAVE -- THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MILLIONS OF VOTES, 22 STATES AND IT STARTED, BY THE WAY, WITH NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE WENT DOWN TO SOUTH CAROLINA.  STATES I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO WIN  AND ENDED UP WINNING IN A LANDSLIDE, ALABAMA, ARKANSAS,  KENTUCKY -- I MAY MOVE TO THE  SOUTH IF NEW YORK DOESN'T TREAT US WELL. THE SOUTH HAS BEEN SO GREAT TO   ME.  AND THEN WE WENT TO FLORIDA, IT'S MY SECOND HOME. THIS IS MY FIRST HOME. FLORIDA IS MY SECOND HOME AND DID SO UNBELIEVABLY. WON BY 20 POINTS AND AN ABSOLUTE LANDSLIDE AND WE HAVE SOMETHING HAPPENING. THE NEXT FOUR, FIVE WEEKS ARE GOING TO BE EXCITED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND WE START ON TUESDAY, SO BIG. AND YOU KNOW THE INTERESTING THING IS WITH ALL THE PRIMARIES WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH, YEARS AND  YEARS AND YEARS OF PRIMARY. NOT IMPORTANT BY THE TIME THEY GET TO NEW YORK. NEW YORK IS IMPORTANT. SO IMPORTANT. LIKE NEW YORK SHOULD BE SO   IMPORTANT AND I SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND I SEE THE POLLS  AND I'M SO HONORED BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW ME BEST ARE THE  PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK. WHEN I'M UP 42 POINTS. I SAID 42 POINTS THAT'S A LOT. UP BY 42 AND 44 POINTS IN THE NEWEST POLLS. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW ME BEST.  WE WILL HAVE AN EXCITING NEXT FOUR, FIVE WEEKS. GREAT TIME IN CLEVELAND. HOPEFULLY NOT A GOOD A TIME BUT HOPEFULLY SOLVED BY THE TIME WE  GET THERE.   ENJOY THE HOTEL AND ENJOY THIS GREAT, GREAT CITY AND IT'S AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU TONIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ",Donald Trump Remarks at New York State Republican Gala

HE HAS THE STRENGTH TO MAKE HARD DECISIONS AND MOTIVATE THOSE AROUND HIM TO ACHIEVE THE IMPOSSIBLE.   IT IS MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU TODAY, A MAN WHO I HAVE LOVED AND RESPECTED MY ENTIRE   LIFE, MY FATHER, DONALD J. TRUMP.  Y'ALL  READY FOR THIS      MR. TRUMP: THANK YOU, THANK   YOU, EVERYBODY.   UNBELIEVABLE. UNBELIEVABLE.   THANK YOU SO MUCH.  THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.   THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FIRST OF ALL, IT'S GREAT TO BE   HOME.   THIS IS HOME.   IT'S GREAT TO BE HOME.    WE LOVE NEW YORK.   WE LOVE NEW YORK AND WE ARE ALL TOGETHER GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, FOLKS.   SO I WAS DRIVING OVER FROM   MANHATTAN AND I PASSED QUEENS -- I LOVE QUEENS. DO WE HAVE A LOT OF QUEENS -- I   LOVE -- I GREW UP IN QUEENS.  I GREW UP IN QUEENS.  AND I USED TO PLAY -- YOU KNOW,   I USED TO GET HERE AT LIKE 2:00   IN THE MORNING TO PLAY A ROUND   OF GOLF AT BETHPAGE.  YOU ALL KNOW WHAT I MEAN, RIGHT?  BUT I LOVE THIS CITY AND I LOVE THIS COUNTRY.   AND WE ARE GOING TO START   WINNING AGAIN WITH OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE WE DON'T WIN. WE NEVER WIN. WE NEVER EVER EVER WIN ANYMORE.   WE DON'T WIN WITH OUR MILITARY.   WE DON'T WIN ON TRADE.  WE DON'T WIN ON HEALTHCARE. WE DON'T WIN ON ANYTHING.   WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING   AGAIN, FOLKS.   SO IN COMING UP, I SAID TO MYSELF AND I SAID TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHEN WE WERE IN THE CAR. I SAID I'M SELF-FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN.   I'M PUTTING MY OWN MONEY IN, RIGHT?  AND ALL OF THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE RUNNING FOR OFFICE THEY'RE LIKE   OFF THE TROUGH, THEY TAKE MONEY   IN FROM ALL THE SPECIAL INTEREST WHERE THEY CAN'T MAKE PROPER   TRANSACTIONS FOR YOU.   AND THAT'S GOING TO STOP.   IT'S GOING TO STOP.   YOU LOOK -- YOU LOOK -- YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING -- I LOVE YOU TOO. I LOVE THESE PEOPLE! THESE ARE MY PEOPLE!  MAN!    I'VE GOT SO MANY FAMILY MEMBERS HERE TODAY.   LOOK AT THAT!   BOY, OH, BOY, MY SONS AND MY   DAUGHTER. DID IVANKA DO A GOOD JOB?   YOU KNOW, SHE HAD A BABY LIKE FIVE DAYS AGO. SO SHE DID A GOOD JOB.  SO I SHOULD NOT SAY IVANKA, YOU'RE FIRED, RIGHT?  I PROMISE. I PROMISE.  I PROMISE. SO I LOVE THIS. YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD   SAY, THAT'S A TOUGH CROWD. IT IS WITH A HEART. WE LOVE THIS CROWD. WE LOVE YOU PEOPLE. WE LOVE YOU.  WE LOVE -- SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.  ON JUNE 16 -- I CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR WITH MILANIA.  AND I TOOK A BIG BREATH. IT WAS ALL ABOUT ORDERS. IT WAS ALL ABOUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS.   BUT TODAY IT'S SAD BUT IT'S ALSO  ABOUT OUR MILITARY. WE CAN'T BEAT ISIS.   WE'RE GOING TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS, BELIEVE ME.  CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT OUR GREAT GENERALS, GENERAL GEORGE PATTON, GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR, CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THEY'D BE SAYING IF THEY SAW WHAT'S GOING   ON WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THE  WAY WE FIGHT? WE DON'T FIGHT LIKE PEOPLE FROM LONG ISLAND.  WE DON'T FIGHT LIKE PEOPLE FROM   NEW YORK. SO WE'RE GOING TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY. IT'S TOTALLY DEPLETED.  YOU KNOW IT.  WE KNOW IT.   THEY DON'T LIKE TALKING ABOUT IT.   WE ARE GOING TO REBUILD OUR   MILITARY. IT'S GOING TO BE BIGGER AND BETTER AND STRONGER THAN EVER   BEFORE AND NOBODY IS GOING TO MESS WITH US. NOBODY. AND VERY, VERY IMPORTANT, WE'RE   GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS.   OUR VETS ARE NOT TAKEN CARE OF. SO OUR COUNTRY OWES NOW, $19 TRILLION.   WE OWE TRILLIONS TO CHINA.  WE OWE TRILLIONS TO JAPAN.  THE WHOLE THING IS ABSOLUTELY   RIDICULOUS. IT'S GOING TO CHANGE AROUND.  IT IS GOING TO CHANGE QUICKLY.  WE ARE GOING TO RENEGOTIATE OUR TRADE DEALS.  THE IN THE CASE OF CHINA, $500 BILLION TRADE DEFICIT EVERY   SINGLE YEAR. IT'S GOING TO END.  MEXICO, I LOVE THE MEXICAN   PEOPLE. I LOVE HISPANICS.   I LOVE HISPANICS. THEY'RE UNBELIEVABLE PEOPLE. WE HAVE NOW $58 BILLION TRADE DEFICIT WITH MEXICO AND OUR BUSINESSES ARE SADLY LEAVING OUR COUNTRY, GOING TO OTHER   COUNTRIES. THEY'RE LEAVING OUR JOBS IN LONG ISLAND.   YOU KNOW IT BETTER THAN ALMOST   ANYBODY. OUR COMPANIES ARE BEING   UPROOTED, TAKEN OUT. THEY'RE MOVING TO MEXICO.   THEY'RE MOVING TO OTHER   COUNTRIES. EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR JOBS. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'RE GOING TO END THE PRACTICE.  WE'RE GOING TO KEEP OUR COMPANIES HERE.   AND WE'RE BRINGING COMPANIES BACK TO THE UNITED STATES.      WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A STRONG   BORDER. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD THE WALL.   IT WILL BE A REAL WALL. A REAL WALL. ARE YOU READY? ARE YOU READY? ARE YOU READY?  WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL?  WHO?  THESE POLL -- POLITICIANS SAY YOU CAN'T GET   MEXICO TO PAY. WHEN WE'RE LOSING $3 BILLION IN TRADE DEFICITS.   FOLKS, HOW EASY IS THAT? IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, $100%. -- 100%.  IT'S GOING HAPPEN.  GO AHEAD.     AH, IT NEVER CHANGES.   HEY, NEW YORK IS CALLED NEW YORK.   IT NEVER EVER EVER WILL CHANGE. SO WHAT'S HAPPENED AND VERY STRONGLY WHAT'S HAPPENED. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THOSE STRONG BORDERS.   AND JUST LIKE YOU SAW LAST WEEK. THE BORDER PATROL, 1,600 PEOPLE, ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT.  AND I DIDN'T EVEN ASKED. THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE EVER DONE IT.   THEY'VE NEVER ENDORSED ANYBODY FOR PRESIDENT. BUT THEY WANT TO HAVE STRONG BORDERS.  AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, HAS ANYBODY HEARD THE SNAKE?  HAS ANYONE HEARD OF IT?   HAVE YOU HEARD? SHOULD WE DO IT? SHOULD WE DO IT?  ALL RIGHT.  THE MAIN THING -- CAN YOU HEAR ME ALL THE WAY IN THE BACK?   CAN YOU HEAR ME? CAN ANYBODY NOT HEAR ME CLEARLY?  ALL RIGHT.  I WANT TO THANK MY BROTHER, MY   COUSINS, MY NEPHEWS, MY BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER-IN-LAWS, MY   SON, WONDERFUL IVANKA AS YOU   KNOW. THEY ALL DIME SEE THIS -- I   MEAN, THEY CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT.   YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW, LYIN' TED CRUZ CAME TOGETHER. HE COULDN'T DRAW 100 PEOPLE. 100 PEOPLE. I'M TELLING YOU.  IN FACT, IT WAS A BIG HEADLINE TODAY IN THE ""NEW YORK POST."" HE COULDN'T DRAW 100 PEOPLE. NOW, DO YOU REMEMBER -- DO YOU REMEMBER -- DO YOU REMEMBER DURING THE DEBATE WHEN HE   STARTED LECTURING ME ON NEW YORK  VALUES LIKE WE'RE NO GOOD, LIKE WE'RE NO GOOD.  HERE IS WHAT IS GOING  TO HAPPEN. IF IT IS NOT ME, IF IT IS SOMEBODY ELSE -- HOW ABOUT  HILLARY? HOW BAD IS HILLARY? HOW BAD IS HILLARY? SO IF IT IS HILLARY OR CRUZ -- BY THE WAY, I WILL BEAT HILLARY SO BADLY IN THE GENERAL ELECTION --   YOU HEARD THE OTHER DAY, MEMBERS OF HER TEAM WERE  CAUGHT SAYING THE ONE PERSON SHE  DOES NOT WANT TO RUN AGAINST IS TRUMP. BELIEVE ME, IT WILL BE FUN. WE HAVE NOT STARTED ON HER YET. THE ONLY TIME I STARTED ON HER WAS TWO MONTHS AGO, AND BELIEVE  ME, HER AND BILL HAD A BAD  EVENING. I DO NOT KNOW IT WILL BE  HILLARY. MAYBE SOMETHING IS GOING TO  HAPPEN. MAYBE SHE WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO RUN. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. FOR THE E-MAIL SCANDAL, MAYBE SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN. SO HERE IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. IF IT IS HILLARY, OR IF IT IS CRUZ, ANYBODY, ANY POLITICIAN,  THEY WILL CALL THEIR LOBBYIST  THAT HAS ""CRUZ"" EMBLAZONED ON HIS FOREHEAD. THEY WILL SEE CRUZ, HILLARY, WHOEVER IT MIGHT BE, AND THEY SAY, YOU CANNOT DO THAT. THEY GAVE YOU MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHEN YOU RAN FOR SENATE. THESE ARE GOOD PEOPLE. HERE IS THE DEAL. I DO NOT GET MONEY FROM ANYBODY. I SELF-FUND SO I CAN DO WHAT IS  RIGHT FOR YOU. I WILL DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU.  SO WITH CARRIER AS AN EXAMPLE, AND I COULD USE FORD, THEY WILL  CALL ME BACK AND PUT A LITTLE  PRESSURE ON ME. PRESSURE DOES NOT WORK ON ME. WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO IS I WILL SAY, YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND. IT IS A 35% TAX. THEY WILL SAY, MR. PRESIDENT, WE  HAVE DECIDED NOT TO LEAVE THE  UNITED STATES. IT IS SO, SO SIMPLE. HERE IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. I HAVE A LOT OF FANS HERE. THEY HAVE KNOWN ME A LONG TIME. A POLL CAME OUT TODAY THAT IS  THROUGH THE ROOF, MY STANDING IN  NEW YORK. WHAT MAKES ME HAPPY IS WHEN THE  PEOPLE WHO KNOW ME BEST, AND YOU  KNOW ME WELL, WHEN THE PEOPLE  WHO KNOW ME THE BEST GIVE ME POLL NUMBERS NO ONE CAN BELIEVE. IN TWO WEEKS, GO VOTE.  WE HAVE MOMENTUM. WE HAVE A MOVEMENT. WE WILL TURN THIS COUNTRY AROUND  SO FAST. YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE.   SO I HAVE BEEN  CALLING A LOT OF SHOTS RIGHT. I WROTE A BOOK IN 2000 AND TALK  ABOUT OSAMA BIN LADEN TWO YEARS BEFORE THE WORLD TRADE CENTER. ONCE IN A WHILE, A POLITICAL  PUNDIT WILL SAY, THAT IS  AMAZING. WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT WE ARE  TALKING ABOUT. I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TAKING  THE OIL FOR WHAT?  FIVE YEARS? YOU KNOW WHO HAS THE OIL? ISIS HAS THE OIL. IRAN AS THE OIL. OUR POLITICIANS ARE INCOMPETENT. THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE HELL  THEY ARE DOING. THE PRESS IS SO DIRTY. THE PRESS IS SO BAD. THEY ARE TERRIBLE. LOOK AT THEM. THEY ARE TERRIBLE. THEY ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE. BY THE WAY, WE HAVE 15,000  PEOPLE. ANOTHER 5000 OUTSIDE. THEY ARE NEVER GOING TO SHOW IT.   YOU WILL GO HOME TO  YOUR FAMILIES TONIGHT. YOU WILL SAY IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. YOUR WIFE OR YOUR HUSBAND WILL SAY, DARLING, WERE THERE MANY PEOPLE THERE? SHE WILL NOT KNOW BECAUSE SHE WATCHED IT ON TELEVISION. I AM ALWAYS MAKING THESE LIFE  SPEECHES. I WOULD LIKE TO DO IT LIKE THE  OTHER GUYS. NOBODY COVERS THEM. NOBODY SHOWS UP. YOU WILL GO HOME TONIGHT AND YOUR WIFE OR HUSBAND WILL SAY,  WERE THERE MANY PEOPLE? THE CAMERAS NEVER WANT TO SCAN  MY AUDIENCES BECAUSE THEY ARE SO BIG AND SO INCREDIBLE. BY THE WAY, WE HAVE SO MANY  PEOPLE. BEFORE I READ THIS THING, I WANT TO THANK YOUR POLICE AND YOUR CHIEF.   I WANT TO THANK BIG JOE FROM NASSAU. YOU KNOW BIG JOE. WHERE IS HE? HE IS AROUND HERE. I WANT TO THANK STEVE FROM SUFFOLK, ALL OF THE INCREDIBLE  POLITICIANS. HALF THE WORLD IS HERE TONIGHT,  BUT I WANT TO THANK ALL THE POLITICAL LEADERS. WE HAVE THE GREATEST LEADERS IN  NEW YORK STATE. WE HAVE LEADERS THAT SAY, WE ARE  NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH THIS  STUFF ANY LONGER. I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR BEING  HERE. SO I HAVE CALLED A LOT OF SHOTS. I HAVE GOTTEN CREDIT, PRETTY MUCH, FOR CALLING A LOT OF SHOTS.  I HAVE A GOOD INSTINCT FOR IT. WE HAVE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS  POURING INTO OUR COUNTRY. WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS  HAPPENING. THAT WILL STOP. WE HAVE THE MIGRATION. WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING IN BY THE  THOUSANDS WITH NO DOCUMENTATION,  WITH NO PAPERWORK. WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY COME  FROM, WHO THEY ARE. YOU WATCH WHAT HAPPENS.  IT COULD BE ISIS.  I HOPE IT IS NOT. YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN PARIS,  WHAT HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA WITH TWO YOUNG PEOPLE THAT GOT  MARRIED. THEY SHOT 14 PEOPLE, KILLED  THEM. THEY BECAME RADICALIZED. WE ARE NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH IT, FOLKS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH IT.   SO THIS WAS WRITTEN  BY THE GREAT AL GREEN. IT WAS A SONG. I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT. WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THE WORDS,  REMEMBER WHAT I AM SAYING. WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THE WORDS,  YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT PEOPLE  POURING INTO THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU. OUT OF 17,000 PEOPLE, I THINK WE HAVE ONE THAT WILL BE HEADLINES  TOMORROW. THAT IS ALL RIGHT. THAT IS ALL RIGHT. FOR GET HIM. YOU CANNOT HEAR HIM ANYWAY. THAT IS ALL RIGHT. ARE WE READY? OR DO YOU WANT TO LET HIM GO A  LITTLE FURTHER? DO YOU WANT HIM OUT? YOU GOT TO GET HIM OUT. YET HIM OUT -- GET HIM OUT. ALL RIGHT. GET HIM OUT. DO NOT HURT THE PERSON. DO NOT HURT THE PERSON. DO NOT HURT THE PERSON. DON'T HURT HIM. IS THE TRUMP RALLY THE GREATEST?   GET HIM OUT.  ALL RIGHT. GET HIM OUT. THEY ARE GONE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? I WILL TELL YOU. BE VERY GENTLE. VERY, VERY GENTLE. WHEN I AM LIKE THIS, THEY SAY TRUMP IS GETTING WEAKER, AND  WHEN I AM TOUGH, THEY SAY HE IS TOO TOUGH. YOU CANNOT WIN. OK. LET'S GO. ARE YOU READY? HERE IS THE STORY. YOU THINK OF THIS IN THE TERMS OF PEOPLE COMING INTO THE  COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY COMING IN  FROM SYRIA.  WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE,  WHO THEY ARE. THEY ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. BELIEVE ME, IT WILL BE A  PROBLEM. THIS IS CALLED ""THE SNAKE."" ON HER WAY TO WORK ONE MORNING, DOWN THE PATH ALONG THE LAKE, A TENDERHEARTED WOMAN SAW A POOR, HALF FROZEN SNAKE. HIS PRETTY SKIN HAD BEEN ALL  FROSTED WITH THE DEW. I WILL TAKE YOU IN AND TAKE CARE  OF YOU. TAKE ME IN, TENDER WOMAN.  TAKE ME IN FOR HEAVENS SAKE, SIGHED THE BROKEN SNAKE. SHE WRAPPED HIM UP ALL COZY IN A  CURVATURE OF SILK AND LAID HIM  BY THE FIRESIDE WITH HONEY AND  MILK.  SHE HURRIED HOME FROM WORK THAT  NIGHT. AS SHOOTING -- SOON AS SHE  ARRIVED, SHE FOUND THAT PRETTY  SNAKE SHE HAD TAKEN IN HAD  FINALLY BEEN REVIVED. TAKE ME IN, TENDER WOMAN. TAKE ME IN, FOR HEAVENS SAKE, SIGHED THE BROKEN SNAKE. SHE CLUTCHED HIM TO HURT BOSOM. YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL, SHE CRIED. IF I HAD NOT BROUGHT YOU IN, YOU  MIGHT HAVE DIED. SHE STROKED HIS PRETTY SKIN AND KISSED HIM AND HELD HIM TIGHT. INSTEAD OF SAYING THANK YOU,  THAT SNAKE GAVE HER A VICIOUS BITE. TAKE ME IN, TENDER WOMAN, TAKE  ME IN FOR HEAVENS SAKE. TAKE ME IN, TENDER WOMAN, SIGHED  THE BROKEN SPEC. -- SNAKE.  I SAVED DO -- YOU, AND NOW YOU  ARE GOING TO DIE. SHUT UP, SILLY WOMAN, SAID THE REPTILE WITH A GRIN. YOU NEW I WAS A SNAKE BEFORE YOU  TOOK ME IN.   BELIEVE ME FOLKS,  BELIEVE ME. BELIEVE ME. WE ALL UNDERSTAND. OUR COUNTRY HAS TO START GETTING  TOUGH. WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT. WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT. WE HAVE TO BE SMART. WE HAVE TO KNOW THAT THERE IS  ALL SORTS OF TRAPS OUT THERE. WE DO NOT WANT MORE WORLD TRADE  CENTERS, PLANES FLYING INTO THE  PENTAGON. WE DO NOT WANT THEM WHERE THAT OTHER PLANE WAS GOING, THE WHITE HOUSE. WE HAD SOME BRAVE PEOPLE. SOME BRAVE PEOPLE TOOK DOWN THAT  PLANE. BRAVE, BRAVE PEOPLE. BRAVE. YOU HAD BETTER BELIEVE IT.  IN THEIR HONOR.   SO WE ARE GOING TO BE  SMART. WE ARE GOING TO BE TOUGH. WE ARE GOING TO BE VIGILANT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE  POLITICALLY CORRECT ALL THE  TIME, POLITICALLY CORRECT.   I LOVE YOU TOO. I DO NOT SAY THAT OFTEN TO GUYS,  BUT I LOVE THAT GUY OVER THERE. SO WE ARE GOING TO DO A LOT OF  THINGS IF I WIN. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE OUR BUDGET. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT GOOD. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THE NATIONS WE ARE FRIENDS WITH,  JAPAN, GERMANY, SOUTH KOREA, SAUDI ARABIA, SO MANY NATIONS,  WE PAY FOR THEIR MILITARY. WE TAKE CARE OF THEIR MILITARY. IT IS ALL FINE. BUT WE ARE $19 TRILLION IN DEBT. WE ARE GOING TO $21 TRILLION IN  DEBT SOON BECAUSE OF A HORRIBLE  BUDGET MADE THREE MONTHS AGO  CALLED THE OMNIBUS BUDGET WHICH LETS EVERYONE COMING TO OUR COUNTRY, WHICH IS A DISASTER,  WHICH HELPS OBAMACARE WHICH, BY THE WAY, WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL  AND REPLACE WITH SOMETHING GREAT.   SO WE ARE GOING TO  BRING BACK OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY  STRONG AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY  RESPECTED AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO USE OUR FINEST  PEOPLE, OUR BRIGHTEST MINDS.  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE GREAT DEALS. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE APPLE  COMPUTERS. COMPANIES LIKE THAT, MANY COMPANIES, THEY ARE GOING TO  START MAKING THEIR PRODUCTS NOT  IN CHINA, BUT IN THE USA, FOLKS. THAT IS WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO  MAKE THEIR PRODUCTS, 100%. 100%.   SO HERE IS THE STORY. HERE IS THE STORY IN A NUTSHELL. YOU ARE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS  NIGHT IN TWO YEARS, FOUR YEARS,  12 YEARS, 20 YEARS, AND SAY THIS  WAS A GREAT EVENING. THIS WAS AN EVENING WEAR, FOR  THE FIRST TIME, WE HEARD SOMEBODY SAY THAT WE ARE NOT  GOING TO BE A SCAPEGOAT AND  STUPID PEOPLE ANYMORE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THE  WORLD TO CONTINUE TO RIPUS US OFF. WE ARE GOING TO GET ALONG GREAT  WITH THE WORLD, BUT WE ARE NOT  GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN. I SAY IT NOW, AMERICA FIRST.    IT WILL HAPPEN, TOO,  FOLKS. AND IT WILL HAPPEN FAST. HERE IS THE STORY. YOU ARE GOING TO REMEMBER THIS  EVENING. AND HOPEFULLY EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS ROOM AND PEOPLE YOU KNOW THAT ARE NOT IN THIS ROOM, NEXT TUESDAY, MEANING IN 12 DAYS, YOU ARE GOING TO GO OUT  AND VOTE. AND YOU ARE GOING TO SAY IT WAS  THE MOST IMPORTANT VOTE YOU HAVE  EVER CAST. YOU ARE GOING TO BE PROUD OF  YOUR COUNTRY AGAIN. YOU ARE GOING TO BE PROUD OF  YOUR PRESIDENT AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING. WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH OUR  MILITARY. WE ARE GOING TO KICK THE HELL  OUT OF ISIS. WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH OUR  VETERANS. WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH HEALTH  CARE. WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF  COMMON CORE. WE ARE BRINGING OUR EDUCATION  LOCALLY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE LOCAL  EDUCATION. WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT AND CHERISH OUR SECOND AMENDMENT, WHICH IS UNDER SIEGE.    AND WE ARE GOING TO  HAVE STRONG BORDERS. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE OUR COUNTRY BACK, AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE  THE WALL. LET ME JUST TELL YOU. WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING  AGAIN, FOLKS. [CHANTING ""BUILD  IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. GONNA HAPPEN. SO REMEMBER THIS EVENING. YOU GO OUT AND VOTE. I CAN ONLY TELL YOU YOU WILL BE  SO PROUD, SO HAPPY. WE ARE GOING TO WIN, WIN, WIN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA  GREAT AGAIN.  I LOVE YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THANK YOU.  >> SO BEAUTIFUL. SHE SAID DO YOU MIND? I WROTE SOMETHING COMING OUT AND I SAID SHOULD I READ IT? AND SHE SAID I DON'T WANT YOU TO READ IT.  I WANT TO THANK MALANIE FOR THAT. YOU KNOW, WISCONSIN IS A SPECIAL PLACE. WE HAD SPEECHES ALL OVER. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STANDING OUTSIDE AN AIRPLANE HANGER BECAUSE THE  HANGER WAS PACKEDISM WE HAD  ANOTHER ONE IN THE MORNING AND IT HAS BEEN AN AMAZING DAY AND PHENOMENAL RESULTS. YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE POLLS. IT IS LIKE A ROCKETSHIP. PRETEND YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT. GO OUT AND VOTE TOMORROW. I USED TO SAY THIS TO POLITICIANS. PRETEND YOU ARE A LITTLE BEHIND. THERE WAS SOMEONE I SAW IN THE AUDIENCE. AN KR  INCREDIBLE WOMAN. MALANIE SAID HELLO AND WAS TAKEN. SHE REPRESENTED YOU SO BEAUTIFULLY. SHE WAS MISS WISCONSIN AND HAS ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE  SPIRITS I HAVE EVER SEEN. HAS A HUSBAND AND A SON AND HER SON IS MAGNIFICENT AND SHE LOVES HIM MORE THAN ANYTHING YOU CAN  IMAGINE. SHE IS GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME AND HAS BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE AND SO LIKE JUST INCREDIBLE OF WHAT  WE ARE TRYING TO DO. I AM A MESSENGER. WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO; MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AND STOP LETTING THE WORLD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US. WE DON'T WIN ANY MORE. WE DON'T WIN WITH TRADE AND PAY FOR EVERYBODY ELSE'S MILITARY. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING. SHE SAW IT AND KNOWS WE ARE  GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR PEOPLE. IT IS GOING TO BE AMERICA FIRST. IT HAS TO BE AMERICA FIRST. WE HAVE NO CHOICE. SHE IS WITH A FRIEND OF HERS WHO IS VERY WELL KNOWN CHELSEA COOL COOLEY WHO IS A TREMENDOUS WOMAN AND GREAT SINGER. I AM NOT MENTION THAT. CHELSEA WOULD BE THE LAST TO WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT. CHELSEA IS SUCH A GREAT FRIEND OF MELISSA YOUNG AND I WANT TO BRING THEM ON STAGE. THIS IS AN UNBELIEVABLE WOMAN. CAN I ASK MELISSA TO COME UP ON  STAGE, PLEASE? THANK YOU. THANKS, EVERYBODY.  >> THAT IS AN AMAZING STORY. WE WILL MAKE SURE IT GOES AS  WELL AS IT CAN. SHE WAS SO AMAZING THE WAY SHE WALKED UP HERE AND SPOKE FROM  THE HEART. WE ALL HAVE TO SPEAK FROM THE HEART. YOU KNOW, THERE IS NO TELEPROMPTER. WE DON'T HAVE TELEPROMPTERS. WE WANT TO DO IT RIGHT FROM  HERE, AND FROM HERE AND HERE. BUT I WANT TO, I SAW MELISSA AND I SAID I HAVE TO HAVE YOU UP. HER STORY IS AMAZING AND A STORY OF COURAGE. WE WILL WORK WITH HER FAMILY AND WE WILL MAKE SURE EVERYTHING  GOES WELL. OKAY. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. SO IN COMING OVER TODAY, AND  GOING THROUGH A FEW OF THEM, I SAID TO A FEW FOLKS, I HAVE TO  EXPLAIN WHAT IS HAPPENING. OUR COUNTRY IS BEING DECIMATED BY STUPIDITY, BAD TRADES, HORRIBLE TRADES, TTP WHICH CRUZ WANTS BADLY AND IT WILL DESTROY WISCONSIN, THIS TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP IS A DISASTER. CRUISE CAN PUSHING IT HARD. -- CRUZ. KASICH, I DON'T THINK HE IS A CONTENDER, HE IS 1-32 AND IT WAS HIS OWN STATE. IN ALL FAIRNESS, JEB BUSH WAS DOING A LOT BETTER. MANY PEOPLE WERE DOING BETTER. IT IS CALLED YOU GET OUT. HE IS TAKING MY VOTES. WE HAVE TO GET OVER 50%. HOW DO YOU DO THAT? AT A CERTAIN POINT IN LIFE WHAT YOU DO IS SAY I AM 1-32. I HAVE WON ONE OUT OF 32. YOU DO WHAT MARCO DID WHICH WAS GREAT. AND YOU DO WHAT RAND PAUL AND A LOT OF THEM DID AND YOU GET OUT. BY THE WAY, IF YOU WANT YOU CAN PUT YOUR NAME UP AND SAY I WANT TO RUN AND YOU GO TO THE CONVENTION AND YOU RUN. BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE, BECAUSE I TELL YOU WHAT, HE TAKES MY VOTES AWAY MUCH MORE  THAN HE DOES CRUZ. I DON'T LIKE IT. I DON'T THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IF WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH HIM WE STILL BEAT HIM EASILY. OKAY, FOLKS? I MEAN OKAY. BUT KASICH VOTED FOR NAFTA WHICH WAS A DISASTER FOR WISCONSIN AND OUR COUNTRY. TED CRUZ WANTS TTP. IT IS GOING TO MAKE NAFTA LOOK  LIKE PEANUTS. WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO US WITH THOSE DOCKMUMENTDOCUMENTS AND CRUZ  INSISTED WE CANNOT TALK ABOUT MONEY MANIPULATION. HE FOUGHT CURRENCY DEVALUATION IS THAT IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST TOOL OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE FOR  TAKING OUR BUSINESSES AND MONEY  AND JOBS. WE CANNOT LET IT GO ONG ANY LONGER. THEY ARE CONTROLLED BY THEIR PACS AND THERE PEOPLE THAT PUT UP THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS. THE LOBBYIST IN WASHINGTON HAVE SIGNS ON THEIR FOREHEAD ""I TAKE CARE OF CRUZ "". I TAKE CARE OF KASICH OR HILLARY. TAKE CARE OF HILLARY. WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN ANYMORE. IT IS TIME. YOU KNOW OBAMA USED TO SAY TIME FOR CHANGE. IT IS TIME FOR CHANGE. BUT REAL CHANGE THIS TIME. NOT THAT CHANGE. REAL CHANGE. OBAMA YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA YESTERDAY STARTED HAVING RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE IRAN DEAL FOR THE FIRST TIME. I COULD HAVE TOLD THEM SIX MONTHS AGO, NINE MONTHS AGO, LONG BEFORE IT WAS SIGNED. THE INK ISN'T EVEN DRY AND HE IS FINALLY STARTING TO UNDERSTAND IT WAS A BIG BEAUTIFUL MISTAKE AND IT IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. BY THE WAY, IRAN IS GETTING WORSE. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO COME INTO  THE COMMUNITY, REMEMBER? WHAT A BUNCH OF BABIES. ARE WE BABIES? HELLO OVER THERE. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO COME INTO THE COMMUNITY AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO, YOU KNOW, GET INVOLVED. NOW YOU SEE THEY JUST ORDERED A 118 AIR BUS JETS. THEY DIDN'T ORDER BOWING. THE REASON, ONE OF THE REASONS IS WE RESTRICT THEM FROM SPENDING. WE GIVE THEM $150 BILLION. THEY ARE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO GIVE US MONEY BY INVESTING OR BUYING OUR PRODUCTS. HOW CRAZY ARE WE? HOW MUCH LONGER IS IT GOING TO  LAST? WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET START? WHEN ARE GO WE GOING TO STOP? WE ARE BEING RIPPED OFF BY VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY  IN THE WORLD. OKAY. WHETHER IT IS MILITARILY OR TRADE. WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE. WE CANNOT WIN WITH THE MILITARY. WE CANNOT BEAT ISIS. CAN YOU IMAGINE GENERAL MCARTHUR OR GENERAL GENERAL GEORGE PATTON SAYING WHAT TIME IS IT NOW? IT IS SO SAD TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING TO YOUR COUNTRY. WE WILL TURN IT AROUND AND MAKE IT RICH AGAIN, MAKE IT STRONG AGAIN --    >> AND SO MANY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS. I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TRADE. I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT TRADE BECAUSE WHEN I ANNOUNCED ON JUNE 16TH IT WAS LIKE THE ACADEMY AWARDS. IT WAS SO MANY CAMERAS. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE  IT. I TOOK A DEEP BREATH AND I SAID LET'S GO. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO IT. IT TAKES GUTS. RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BELIEVE ME TAKES GUTS. IT TAKES A LOT OF GUTS, BELIEVE ME. EVEN FOR THE POLITICIANS THAT RUN AT LEAST THEY ARE OUT ON THE LINE AND YOU SEE THE DISHONESTY AND SEE WHERE I WON LOUISIANA BUT I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO GET AS MANY DELEGATES AS THE PERSON I  BEAT. SOMEBODY SAID THERE IS A RULE AND ANOTHER RULE. I DON'T CARE ABOUT RULES, FOLKS. I GO OUT, I CAMPAIGN, WE WIN. WE GET THE DELEGATES; RIGHT? WE HAVE MORE VOTES THAN CRUZ AND HAVE BEATEN HIM IN MOST OF THE STATES. WE ARE WINNING SO MUCH. WE ARE WINNING BY ALMOST 300 DELEGATES. I THINK WE CLOSE IT OUT BEFORE  THE CONVENTION. I THINK WE CLOSE IT OUT BEFORE THE CONVENTION. IT IS LIKE A PRICE FIGHTER. THEY GO IN WITH THEY SAY YOU MAY HAVE AN UNFRIENDLY DECISION BUT  NO, WHEN YOU KNOCK THEM OUT THERE IS NO UNFRIENDLY DECISIONS. IF WE GET THE DELEGATES IT IS A KNOCKOUT. MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE CALLING AND WANT TO GET ON BOARD. WHEN I LOOKED AT WHAT HAPPENED TO ONE OF MY GREAT FRIENDS OF MINE WHO LIVES NOT FAR FROM  HERE. HE SAID WITH WISCONSIN YOU ARE  GOING TO WIN. I SAID, WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK? I AM NOT SEEING POLLS THAT ARE GREAT. I AM A LITTLE BIT DOWN IN SOME AND A LITTLE DOWN -- HE SAID NO, NO, YOU ARE GOING TO WIN. BUT YOU HAVE TO BE THERE. YOU HAVE TO COME IN AND TALK TO THE PEOPLE LIKE WE DID THIS  AFTERNOON AT THE HANGER. AND HE SAID YOU ARE GOING TO WIN. I MEAN YOU ARE GOING TO WIN. HE IS A SMART GUY. GREAT GUY. HE SAID YOU HAVE TO COME IN. AND WE HAVE BEEN MAKING SPEECHES. THREE TODAY, FOUR YESTERDAY, WE  ARE HERE CONSTANTLY. YOU ARE GOING TO GET SO SICK OF ME YOU ARE GOING TO SAY GET HIM THE HELL OUT OF HERE. WE ARE MAKING SO MUCH PROGRESS. IT HAS BEEN SO INSPIRING TO SEE THE PEOPLE. EVEN YOU PEOPLE DON'T SIT DOWN. STAND UP, WHAT THE HECK. WE DON'T WANT TO SIT DOWN. WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO SIT DOWN; RIGHT? BUT I DO APPRECIATE THAT. IT AS A SIGN OF AFFECTION AND RESPECT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. SO, WE HAVE TO BRING YOUR COUNTRY BACK. WITH CHINA WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT OF $500 BILLION A YEAR. WITH MEXICO, WE WILL BUILD A WALL AND HAVE STRONG BORDERS. STRONG BORDERS, BELIEVE ME. WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT OF $58 BILLION A YEAR. THE WALL COST $10 BILLION TO BUILD AND THE POLITICIANS ARE SAYING HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY GET THEM TO PAY? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, FOLKS, WE HAVE GOOD BUSINESS PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE. WHEN YOU HAVE A $58 BILLION DEFICIT AND YOU HAVE A $10  BILLION WALL IT IS EASY. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. THEY SAID HOW DO YOU GET THEM TO PAY? I SAID RELY ON ME. SO EASY. THAT IS SO EASY. WE WILL HAVE A STRONG BORDER. YOU KNOW, TWO DAYS AGO I WAS GREATLY HONORED BECAUSE THE BORDER PATROL, THE FOLKS THAT DO A GREAT JOB AND ARE TOLD TO STAND BACK BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO. THEY WANT TO DO THEIR JOB PROPERLY. THEY ARE PROUD PEOPLE AND INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. WE MAY NOT NEED THE WALL BUT WE ARE BUILDING IT ANYWAY. BELIEVE ME. 15,500 PEOPLE GAVE ME AN ENDORSEMENT AND I DIDN'T ASK OR ANY. FIRST TIME THEY HAVE EVER DONE IT. SHERIFF JOE FROM ARIZONA, I WON  ARIZONA BIG. WE HAVE TO HAVE STRONG BORDERS. WE CANNOT LET THE SYRIANS COME IN THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE. WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE SYRIANS. THIS COULD BE THE ALL-TIME GREAT TRO TRO TROJAN HORSE. WE WANT TO HELP THEM AND BUILD SAFE ZONES IN SYRIA. I WANT THE GULF STATES TO PAY  FOR IT. THEY HAVE NOTHING BUT MONEY. WE WILL RUN IT, DO A GOOD JOB, BUT LET SOMEBODY ELSE PAY FOR IT FOR A CHANGE. WE CANNOT DO IT. THE GREAT AL GREEN WROTE THE SNAKE? HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE HEARD ""THE  SNAKE""? PEOPLE LOVE IT. I LOVE IT BECAUSE IT SAYS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO US IF WE  ARE NOT CAREFUL. THIS REALLY PER TAINS TO ALLOWING PEOPLE INTO OUR COUNTRY THAT WE KNOW ARE GOING TO GIVE US PROBLEMS. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEIR  DOCUMENTS ARE. THERE ARE NO PAPERS OR NOTHING. WE LET THEM IN. HOW STUPID CAN WE BE? THIS IS CALLED THE SNAKE. I THINK IT IS PRETTY GOOD. ALL RIGHT? WE WILL GIVE IT A SHOT. YOU READY FOR FOR THIS? A COUPLE OF YOU HAVE HEARD IT BUT SOME OF YOU HAVEN'T. ON HER WAY TO WORK ONE MORNING, DOWN THE PATH ALONG THE LAKE, A TENDER HEARTED WOMAN SAW A POOR, HALF FROZEN SNAKE. HIS PRETTY COLORED SKIN HAD BEEN ALL FROSTED WITH THE DEW. OH, WELL, SHE CRIED. I WILL TAKE YOU IN AND TAKE CARE OF YOU. TAKE ME IN, OH TENDER WOMAN, CRIED THE BROKEN SNAKE. SHE WRAPPED HIM UP COZY IN A CURVATURE OF SILK AND LAID HIM BY THE FIRE SIDE WITH SOME HONEY AND MILK. SHE HURRIED HOME FROM WORK THAT NIGHT AND AS SOON AS SEE ARRIVED SHE FOUND THAT PRETTY SNAKE SHE HAD TAKEN IN HAD BEEN RERIVEVIVED. TAKE ME IN OH TENDER WOMAN. SHE CLUTCHED HIM TO HER BOOSEM. YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL. IF I HADN'T BROUGHT YOU IN BY NOW HEAVENS SAKE YOU MIGHT HAVE DIED. SHE STROKED HIS PRETTY SKIN, KISSED HIM AND HELD HIM TIGHTMENTTIGHT. BUT INSTEAD OF SAYING THANK YOU THAT SNAKE GAVE HER A VICIOUS BITE. TAKE ME IN OH TENDER WOMAN SIGHED THE VERY, VERY HEALTHY SNAKE. I SAVED YOU AND YOU BIT ME. YOU KNOW YOUR BITE IS POISONOUS AND NOW I AM GOING TO DIE. SHUT UP, SILLY WOMAN, SAID THE REPTILE WITH A GRIM, YOU DAMN WELL I WAS A SNAKE BEFORE YOU TOOK ME IN. THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY. WE NEED BORDERS AND WE WILL HAVE BORDERS AND WE NEED GREAT TRADE DEALS AND WE WILL HAVE THEM. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR MEXICO BUT WE CANNOT LET MEXICO AND CHINA AND ANY COUNTRY YOU WANT TO NAME STEAL OUR BUSINESS,  STEAL OUR JOBS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN WISCONSIN AND YOU  SEE IT. THE REASON I BEAT YOUR GOVERNOR WAS I JUST READ OFF THE STATISTICS. I STOOD UP AND READ THE STATISTICS. YOU ARE LOOSING JOBS. STEVEN CAME OUT BEFORE ME AND GAVE YOU THE INFORMATION SO I WILL NOT BORE YOU WITH IT. BUT IS AVERAGE. OUR COUNTRY IS LESS THAN AVERAGE. OUR COUNTRY IS DOING SO BADLY. IT IS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS. WE HAVE TO SMARTEN UP. WE HAVE TO GET REALLY TOUGH AND SO VIGILANT AND NOT BE SO  POLITICALLY CORRECT. WE HAVE TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY. WHEN THE GREAT FORD PLANT BUILDS A PLANT IN MEXICO, AND WHEN NABISCO MOVES TO MEXICO AND CARRIER AIR CONDITIONERS JUST  ANNOUNCED THEY ARE MOVING TO NEXT CO. PHIZER IS MOVING TO IRELAND. A LOT OF FRIENDS HAVE BEEN COMING UP TO ME SAYING DONALD LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. ARE THESE POLITICIANS THAT DUMB? I SAID NO, THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY THAT DUMB. SOME ARE BUT THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY THAT DUMB. THEY ARE ALL TAKEN CARE OF BY  THE SPECIAL INTEREST. WHEN YOU WANT SOMETHING DONE YOU SEE CERTAINLY PEOPLE IN  WASHINGTON, WHO IS BETTER THAN ME, TAKE A LOOK AT ME. BEFORE JUNE 16TH, I WAS A PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT. THEY WILL DO, NOT WHAT IS RIGHT  FOR YOU, BUT THEY WILL DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE COMPANY THEY REPRESENT OR THE COUNTRY THEY REPRESENT AND THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES TO GET RIPPED OFF, RIPPED OFF, RIPPED OFF. AND A LOT OF TIMES THEY WILL SAY HOW COULD A DEAL BE SO STUPIDLY MADE. THESE PEOPLE ARE SO STUPID. BUT THEY ARE NOT STUPID. THEY ARE IN IT FOR THEMSELVES. THEY ARE TOTALLY CONTROLLED BY  THE MONEY. BELIEVE ME. THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR OUR  COUNTRY. TERRIBLE THINGS ARE HAPPENING AND WE ARE GETTING WEAKER AND WEAKER. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AND MILLIONS OF JOBS ARE BEING TAKEN OUT. YOU SEE THE JOBS IN WISCONSIN THE MANUFACTURING IS DOWN AND GLOOMY. IT IS A DISASTER WHAT IS GOING ON WITH OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE JOBS LEFT. THEY DO IT WITH MANIPULATION OF CURRENCY AND SO MANY ELEMENTS  OUR POLITICIANS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING. WHEN THEY DO KNOW WHAT IS  HAPPENING AND THEY LET IT HAPPEN IT IS EVEN WORSE. SO I AM NOT TAKING MONEY FROM ANYBODY. I AM SELF-FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN. WE ARE GOING TO GET IT STOPPED. I LOOK AT THIS U.S. MANUFACTURING AND JUST LOOK AT  THESE CHARTS. YOU CAN SEE THEM. I THINK YOU CAN. THIS IS WHERE WE ARE GOING. THERE WAS ONE I JUST SAW AND  JUST GOT THIS. IT IS INCREDIBLE. LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS U.S. MANUFACTURE JOBS  RAPIDLY DECLINE. LOOK AT THAT CHART. ANOTHER COUPLE YEARS THERE WILL  NOT BE ANY JOBS. THE JOBS WE HAVE ARE BAD JOBS. THESE ARE BAD JOBS. NOT GOOD JOBS. EVERYBODY ADMITS THAT. THEY SAID WE AGREE THEY ARE BAD JOBS. THE NUMBER THEY TALK ABOUT WHEN THEY SAY 5% UNEMPLOYMENT IT IS FICTITIOUS. WHEN YOU STOP LOOKING FOR A JOB YOU ARE CONSIDERED STATISTICALLY EMPLOYED EMPLOYED. IT WAS A NUMBER MADE UP PROBABLY BY THE PRESIDENT BUT CERTAINLY POLITICIANS TO MAKE THEM LOOK GOOD. THE ECONOMY IS NOT GOOD. THE ECONOMY IS BAD. WE ARE SITTING ON A BUBBLE. THE BANKS HAVE MONEY. THEY GAVE IT TO YOU FOR NOTHING  IF YOU ARE RICH. IF YOU ARE NOT RICH, WHICH IS WHEN YOU NEED THE MONEY, THEY DON'T LOAN IT TO YOU. PROBABLY HERE YOU HAVE GREAT  COMPANIES WITH GOOD SMALLER COMPANIES AND YOU CANNOT GET THE BANKS TO GIVE YOU MONEY. THE BANKS ARE CONTROLLED BY THE REGULATORS. THE SYSTEM THAT THIS COUNTRY IS RUN UNDER IS OUT OF CONTROL. AND WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE IT. WE ARE GOING TO BRING BACK THE  JOBS. WE WILL BRING BACK OUR COMPANIES. AND YOU KNOW I HAVE HAD SUCH A  RESPONSE AND THE REASON I HAD THE RESPONSE IS BECAUSE OF THAT AND THEN I LOOK AT THE ADS TODAY AND I AM IN MY HOTEL LOOKING AT THE ADS AND CRUZ MAKES THIS UP SAYING WE WILL BRING BACK JOBS. HE IS USING MY SAME LANGUAGE. HERE IS THE PROBLEM; THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN. IF THEY DID LYING TED. LYING TED. LIAR. HE COMES UP -- DID YOU EVER SEE  A GUY LIKE THIS? BEN CARSON, WHO ENDORSED ME IS A GREAT GUY, AND LYING HEAD, HE SAID BEN HAS LEFT THE RACE. THIS WAS ON ELECTION DAY. IT IS NOT LIKE TWO DAYS BEFORE  OR AFTER. IT IS DURING THE ELECTION HE  LEFT THE RACE. PEOPLE BELIEVED HIM. AND THOUSANDS OF VOTES WERE CAST NOT FOR BEN BUT FOR TED CRUZ. IT IS PURE DECEPTION AND IT IS LYING. THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS. DURING THE DEBATES, MARCO RUBIO LOOKED OVER AND SAID YOU ARE A LIAR AND I SAID I NEVER HEARD AN ANOTHER POLITICIAN CALL HIM A LIAR SO WE CALL HIM LY'N TED. I HAVE MET A LOT OF TOUGH PEOPLE BUT NEVER ANYBODY WHO LIES AS  MUCH AS HIM. I HAVE THE TREMENDOUS EVANGELICAL SUPPORT AND SUCH  INCREDIBLE SUPPORT. HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO GET THE EVANGELICALS BUT THEY DON'T  LIKE LIARS. HE WALKS UP AND WALKS IN WITH THE BIBLE HELD HIGH. HELD HIGH AND THEN HE STARTS TO  LIE. HE IS BAD. SO ANYWAY, I DON'T THINK THAT YOU ARE GOING TO FALL FOR THAT. I REALLY DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN FALL. HEAP HE DOESN'T TALK. I SAID TED, TAKE IT EASY, JUST TALK. WE ARE DOING REALLY WELL. THE WHOLE THING IS WORKING OUT. I LOVED BEING HERE. I HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A LONG TIME TIME. THANK YOU. WE ARE STAYING AND I THINK WE WILL DO FOX AND FRIENDS TOMORROW AND SOME OTHER SHOWS. WE WANT TO BRING THIS HOPE. WE HAVE A MOVEMENT GOING ON, FOLKS. IT IS A MOVEMENT OF INTELLIGENCE AND COMMON SENSE. WE WILL NOT LET CARRIER MAKE AIR CONDITIONS, FIRE ALL OF ITS PEOPLE, AND MAKE AIR CONDITIONERS AND COME IN AND TAKE THE MONEY OUT OF THE COUNTRY. REMEMBER JEB BUSH HE IS NOT A  CONSERVATIVE THEY WOULD SAY. I AM A CONSERVATIVE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I BELIEVE IN FREE TRADE. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE FREE TRADE YOU NEED SMART PEOPLE RUNNING YOUR  SIDE OF THE FREE TRADE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE SMART PEOPLE,  OR IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE TED CRUZ THAT ARE TOTALLY CONTROLLED BY THE PEOPLE THAT GIVE HIM THE MONEY AND CONTROLLED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT. LOOK AT THE ESTABLISHMENT. THIS GUY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE WORD ESTABLISHMENT BUT NOW THEY SAY TRUMP IS TERRIBLE HE DOESN'T WANT MY MONEY. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO CAME INTO MY OFFICE AND WANTED TO GIVE ME MILLIONS AND I SAID I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY, I AM SELF-FUNDING. HE WANTED TO SUPPORT ME. I SAID I DON'T WANT IT. HE WAS FINALLY CONVINCED HE DIDN'T WANT HIS MONEY. AND I SAID WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THE MONEY AND HE SAID I AM GOING TO GIVE IT IT ANOTHER CANDIDATE. AND I SAID WHY? HE IS LIKE A GAMBLER. HE WANTS TO GIVE ME PROBABLY CLOSE TO $10 MILLION. I WOULD HAVE HAD THE GREATEST SUPER PAC IN HISTORY IF I HAD  TAKEN THE MONEY. MY WHOLE LIFE, I SAID THIS BEFORE, MY WHOLE LIFE AS A  BUSINESS PERSON IS THIS. IT IS OKAY. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WHERE IT. I KEEP TAKING. I TAKE AND TAKE. BUT NOW I AM GOING TO TAKE FOR THE UNITED STATES AND WE WILL NOT BE THE STUPID PEOPLE ANYMORE. WE WILL NOT BE THE STUPID PEOPLE ANYMORE. WE CANNOT BE. WE CAN'T BE. WITH NATO, WHEN THEY DON'T PAY, I SAID I WAS ASKED A QUESTION BY WOLF BLITZER A FAIR QUESTION NATO. I HAVE BEEN A WORLD CLASS BUSINESS MAN. BUILT A GREAT COMPANY. I TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE THAT IS THE THINKING WE NEED IN WASHINGTON. WE NEED SP OF THAT THINKING. WOLF BLITZER ASKED ME LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT NATO. I HAVEN'T BEEN ASKED ABOUT NATO BUT I UNDERSTAND NATO AND UNDERSTAND COMMON SENSE AND I AM A SMART PERSON LIKE MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, HOPEFULLY ALL OF THE PEOPLE, BUT HE ASKED ME ABOUT NATO AND I SAID IT IS OBSOLETE. GUYS THAT STUDY NATO, AND GOOD PEOPLE, BUT THEY STUDY NATO AND  SAID I DON'T BELIEVE IT. THEY STUDY IT BECAUSE THEY ARE SO INTO IT. IT WAS REALLY PUT THERE -- YOU HAD THE SOVIET UNION AND NOW YOU HAVE RUSSIA WHICH IS DIFFERENT BUT RUSSIA IS POWERFUL SO WE CAN SORT OF SAY IT IS A BALANCE BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY COVER TERRORISM. MANY OF THE COUNTRIES IN THERE ARE NOT COUNTRIES YOU ASSOCIATE WITH TERRORISM. SO I SAID, NUMBER TWO, TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THE UNITED STATES PAYS FAR TOO MUCH. WHY ARE WE ALWAYS PAYING THE  BILLS TO PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE? THE PRESS THE NEXT DAY SAYS TRUMP DOESN'T WANT NATO. I SAID WE HAVE TO PAY OUR BILLS AND IF THEY CANNOT PAY THE BILLS THEY HAVE TO GO. THIS ISN'T 68 YEARS AGO. THIS ISN'T WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY FORMED LIKE MANY YEARS AGO. MANY DECKADEDECADES AGO. IT IS INTERESTING, SOME OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE HAVE SAID TRUMP  IS GENIUS. IT IS OBSOLETE AND THAT IS TRUE. WE CANNOT GIVE THE FREE RIDES AWAY ANYMORE, FOLKS. WE NEED SOMEBODY WITH BACKGROUND. IT IS AMERICA FIRST. NORTH CAROLINA IS A PROBLEM. A PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED BY CHINA EASY BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO  SOLVE IT. THEY WANT TO TWEAK IT. THEY ARE BUILDING A MASSIVE MILITARY FORT AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE DOING THAT AND TAKING ON  MONEY AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE  IMBALANCE OF TRADE AND THE KIND  OF MONEY. HOW ABOUT THIS? WE OWE CHINA $1.7 TRILLION. THEY TAKE OUR MONEY, OUR JOBS,  AND I LOVE THEM. I AM NOT ANGRY AT CHINA. I AM ANGRY AT OUR LEADERS FOR LETTING IT HAPPEN. THEY TAKE OUR JOBS AND TAKE OUR MONEY. THEY TAKE EVERYTHING. WE OWE THEM $1.7 TRILLION. THAT IS A MAGIC ACT. JAPAN, THEY SEND CARS BY THE MILLIONS COMING OFF THE BOATS. LOS ANGELES, I WAS THERE AT THE DOCKS AND LOOK AT THE BIGGEST  SHIPS YOU HAVE SEEN. THE CARS ARE POURING OFF THE SHIPS. WE OWE THEM $1.5 TRILLION. IT IS LIKE HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN? HERE IS THE STORY. WE ARE GOING IT CHANGE OUR THINKING AND BE THE SMART PEOPLE. WE ARE GOING TO BE SO SMART AND  SO SHARP.   >> SO A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WE PROTECT JAPAN. DOES ANYBODY KNOW? YOU MIGHT KNOW THIS. WE PROTECT JAPAN, GERMANY AND SOUTH KOREA. WHEN YOU WANT A TELEVISION YOU  GET IT FROM SOUTH KOREA. AND BIG SHIPS. THESE ARE MONSTER ECONOMIES AND WE PROTECT THEM. THEY DON'T PAY WHAT THEY SHOULD  BE PAYING FOR NOT HAVING TO HAVE THIS MASSIVE MILITARY APPARATUS  THAT WE SUPPLY. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE GET THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN WASHINGTON FOR MANY YEARS. I AM NOT BLAMING. OBAMA IS THE WORST. THE WORST. I MEAN HE JUST REALIZED THE IRAN DEAL IS A BAD DEAL. I SAID WHY DIDN'T YOU LISTEN TO ME TWO YEARS AGO? JUST TWO YEARS AGO. CAN YOU IMAGINE? DID YOU EVER SEE A DEAL TAKE SO LONG? USUALLY IT IS BAD AUTOMATICALLY WHEN IT TAKES THAT LONG. WE PROTECT JAPAN. IT COMES OUT AND THEY SAY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF JAPAN AND I SAID I WOULD HAVE TO TELL JAPAN AND I AM TALKING ABOUT OTHER NATIONS  BECAUSE I HAVE GREAT FRIENDS FROM JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA. WE HAVE TO GO TALK TO IT. WE LOVE PROTECTING YOU. WE DON'T WANT THEM TO ARM NECESSARILY BUT AT SOME POINT HOW LONG ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS? WE HAVE TO SAY YOU HAVE TO HELP  US OUT. WE HAVE THIS MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE HAVE TO GET RID OF BECAUSE WE ARE SITTING ON ONE OF THE WORST BUBBLES YOU WILL SEE. WE HAVE TO STRAIGHTEN IT OUT. WE ARE TAKING CARE OF ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES. WE GO TO JAPAN AND I AM TELLING  THE PEOPLE AND THEY SAID THAT SOUNDS GOOD. YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF US. THEY WILL PROBABLY SAY INITIALLY NO. AND THEN THEY LEAVE AND WE WILL  SAY YES. BUT IF THEY DON'T YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE PREPARED. YOU CANNOT SAY THE PROBLEM WITH  THE IRAN DEAL IS SECRETARY KERRY WAS LIKE AN AMATEUR. THEY CALL HIM AMATEUR NIGHT. HE REFUSED TO WALK. THEY WERE LAUGHING AT HIM IN THE STREETS OF IRAN AND CLAIMING IT  WAS THE BEST DEAL BEFORE IT WAS MADE. THEY WERE SAYING THIS DEAL IS UNBELIEVABLE. THEY WERE LAUGHING AT THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF THIS COUNTRY. THEY WERE LAUGHING AT THE UNITED STATES SAYING THIS DEAL IS SO GREAT. AND THEY ARE DANCING. REMEMBER BURNING THE FLAG AND DANCING? WHEN THEY START DANCING ABOUT A  DEAL I AM MAKING AND BURNING THE AMERICAN FLAG I'M OUT OF THERE. HE JUST KEPT GOING BACK. AND I KEPT WAITING. I WANTED TO CALL HIM. I WANTED TO CALL HIM. I WANTED TO SAY WALK. EVERY SINGLE THINK HE WOULD SAY WE WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS. NO. OH, OKAY. YOU GOT IT. THE PERSIANS ARE UNBELIEVABLE NEGOTIATOR. JUST YESTERDAY PRESIDENT OBAMA BROUGHT UP HE IS UNHAPPY. THINK OF IT. A $150 BILLION. IT IS THE WORST DEAL. WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE PRISONERS BACK BEFORE WE STARTED NEGOTIATING, INCREASE THE SANCTIONS. SAY YOU GIVE YOUR PRISONERS BACK OR WE ARE NOT STARTING. YOU LEAVE AND WHAT HAPPENS? YOU DOUBLE UP THE SANCTIONS AND WITHIN 24 HOURS THEY CALL YOU AND SAY YOU HAVE YOUR PRISONERS. THAT COULD HAVE BEEN YEARS AGO. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW  WHAT THEY ARE DOING. HERE IS THE STORY. YOU NEED TRUMP. YOU DO. YOU NEED TRUMP. WE HAVE TO HAVE TRUMP. WE DO. I MEAN YOU HAVE TO HAVE TRUMP. IT IS SORT OF INTERESTING BECAUSE I SEE WHEN I TURN ON THE TELEVISION.

HOW GOOD IS SHE? THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH, SARAH. WE LANDED AND THE SNOW WAS POURING IN, IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.  I HAVE THAT WE WERE LANDING IN ALASKA. IT IS BEAUTIFUL.  IT IS SUCH AN A COUPLE TURNOUT -- INCREDIBLE TURNOUT. WE ARE DOING SO WELL AND WE ARE  SO PROUD. WE LOVE WISCONSIN, IT IS A SPECIAL PLACE. I THINK THAT WE WILL DO REALLY  WELL.   REALLY WELL. LOOK AT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, SOMETHING I SAID ON  THE WAY UP AND I WAS SAYING IT  BEFORE, I AM SELF FUNDING MY  CAMPAIGN.  I DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS WORTH IT,  I WILL LET YOU KNOW IN ABOUT A  YEAR OR LESS. BUT I THINK IT MEANS A LOT. THE REASON IS, ALL OF THESE PEOPLE I AM RUNNING AGAINST, THE  REPUBLICANS AND THE DEMOCRATS,  THEY ARE NOT DOING IT THE WAY  THAT I AM.  WHEN HILLARY CLINTON GETS MONEY  FROM THE OIL INDUSTRY AND ALL  THE OTHER INDUSTRIES, WHEN JOHN KASICH GETS MONEY FROM THE PEOPLE HE IS GETTING MONEY FROM,  THEY TOTALLY CONTROL HIM. BELIEVE ME.  WHEN TED CRUZ, LYING TED -- BELIEVE ME, LYING SAID -- TED. I HAVE MET A LOT TOUGHER THAN  HIM, BY HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY LIE LIKE LYING TED. WHEN HE GETS MONEY FROM THE BANKS, OIL, GAS, FROM  EVERYTHING, BELIEVE ME, THEY  HAVE HIM. I GET MONEY FROM ME. I REALLY AM HERE FOR ONE REASON,  TO REPRESENT YOU. TO REPRESENT YOU. BELIEVE ME.   AND, IT IS SO GREAT. WHEN I COME TO PLACES. I TOLD MY PEOPLE, LET'S KEEP THEM SMALLER, BECAUSE WE HAD PROTESTERS. THEY SAID, LET'S KEEP THEM  SMALLER, SO WE CAN CHECK  EVERYBODY WHO COMES IN. I SAID, YEAH, BUT I LIKE THE BIG. WE HAVE 5000 -- WHERE IS THE LONG? -- MALL? WE HAVE 5000 PEOPLE IN THE MALL,  I SAID ENOUGH, LET THEM HAVE PROTESTERS. WHO CARES? WE HAVE 5000 PEOPLE ON THE OTHER  SIDE AND I FEEL SO GUILTY, LET'S ALL SAY, WE LOVE YOU.  BUT YOU WOULD NOT SWAP SEATS. I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR WELL. CAN YOU HEAR WELL? AND CAN THE MALL HERE WELL? -- HEAR WELL? I HOPE THEY CAN. THIS IS AMAZING. LOOK, I AM DOING THIS TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. LOOK AT ALL OF THESE HATS. WE ARE DOING THIS --    WE ARE DOING THIS TO  MAKE, LOOK AT THAT GUY. STAND UP.  DO I LOOK LIKE THAT? CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?  LOOK AT THAT. ALRIGHT, IT LOOKS GREAT.  GOOD JOB. IT IS A SIMPLE, BEAUTIFUL THEME, ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN."" WE HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS, SO FAR WORSE THEN YOU UNDERSTAND. I KNOW THE NUMBERS. THE GOVERNOR GAVE A PLAQUE A  YEAR AGO WHEN HE THOUGHT THAT I  LIKED HIM. I DO, HE CAME TO MY OFFICE, HE  GAVE ME A PLAQUE. I BET THAT HE WISHES HE COULD DO  THAT OVER AGAIN. I NEED TO SHOW THAT PLAQUE. I KEEP SAYING, NO, I SHOULD NOT HAVE BROUGHT IT. I WANT TO SHOW IT. WE WILL BE HERE. I THINK THAT IT WILL BE AN  AMAZING COUPLE OF DAYS. I THINK THAT WE ARE GOING TO  WIN. I REALLY DO.   I THINK, I THINK THAT  PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SURPRISED . I SAW THE OUTPOURING THAT WE  HAD. SOMEBODY ELSE WAS HERE AND THEY HAD 300 PEOPLE, AND WE HAVE THOUSANDS IN HERE, 5000 OUT THERE.  I THINK WE HAVE MORE THAN 2000  IN HERE. I THINK THAT WE ARE GOING TO  WIN. LET'S JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I KNOW ONE THING, WE ARE GOING  TO DWELL. -- WELL. WELL DOES NOT WIN -- MEAN ANYTHING.  HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A MAN NAMED VINCE LOMBARDI? IN THIS NECK OF THE WOODS? WHAT DID HE SAY ABOUT WINNING? RIGHT.   HE KNOWS.  I MET HIM ONCE AND HE WAS WITH THREE OF HIS PLAYERS, IN A RESTAURANT.  THESE THREE PLAYERS WERE TOUGH  COOKIES. TWO OF THEM ARE FRIENDS OF MINE  AND THEY PLAYED FOR YOUR TEAM. THEY WERE GREAT PLAYERS. VINCE LOMBARDI WAS NOT A BIG GUY.  HE WALKED IN AND HE WAS ANGRY,  YOU COULD SEE, AND HE CAME OVER  TO THE TABLE.  HE SAW THESE THREE GUYS, TWICE  HIS SIZE, THEY COULD HAVE SWATTED HIM.  I WILL NOT TELL YOU WHAT HE DID,  HE ACTUALLY GRABBED ONE OF THEM  BY THE SHIRT. TODAY, YOU CANNOT DO THAT. THEN HE LEFT.  HE GAVE HIM AN EARFUL. I WANT TO TELL YOU, THIS BIG STRONG GUY, HE WEIGHED ABOUT 250 THEN. THAT IS LIKE 310 NOW. AND HE LEFT HIM A STORMED OUT --  LEFT, STORMED OUT. AND THIS GUY WAS SHAKEN. I SAID TO MYSELF, THE REASON THAT VINCE, I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR HIM AS A COACH, AND I LOVE BILL BELICHICK, CERTAIN PEOPLE YOU NEED TO RESPECT. AND I SAID AT ONE OF MY OTHER MEETINGS, TOM BRADY IS A FRIEND  OF MINE. HE IS GREAT. NICE, RIGHT? YOU THINK YOUR QUARTERBACK IS  GREAT. TOM TOLD ME THAT. VINCE LOMBARDI, THE REASON HE  GOT AWAY, HIS WINNING. IF HE DID NOT WIN, HE CANNOT GET  AWAY WITH THAT. HE WOULD NOT BE A LOOK AND GET  THAT KIND OF FEAR, RESPECT, BUT FEAR FROM A BIG, STRONG PLAYER. BUT HE WON. HE HAD ONE MANY TIMES -- WON  MANY TIMES. AND THE RESPECT THEY HAD FOR HIM  WAS A CREDIBLE -- INCREDIBLE. WE DO NOT WIN. WE CANNOT BE ISIS. -- BEAT ISIS. WE CANNOT BEAT TRADE, CHINA,  MEXICO, THEY THINK WE ARE STUPID. MEXICO, JAPAN, VIETNAM, INDIA, ANY NATION, NAME A NATION --  THEY DO WELL. IT DOES NOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THEY DO WELL, AND THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT, THE MORE I REALIZE, THEY DO WELL FOR A VERY  SPECIFIC REASON. NOT THAT THE POLITICIANS ARE SO  STUPID, MANY OF THEM ARE, MANY  OF THEM ARE NOT, BUT BECAUSE POLITICIANS TAKE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PEOPLE REPRESENTING CERTAIN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD, OR COMPANIES INVOLVED IN OTHER  PARTS OF THE WORLD, AND THEY DO THINGS NOT IN YOUR BEST INTEREST.  WHEN I SAY I AM SELF FUNDING, I  HAVE TURNED DOWN MORE MONEY, I BET THAT ANY HUMAN BEING HAS TURNED DOWN FOR POLITICAL RUN. FRANKLY, EVERYBODY TAKES MONEY.   AND WHEN YOU THINK OF  IT, NOT A BIG DIFFERENCE. FOR YEARS, PROBABLY, I MAY BE WRONG, BUT THE ONLY ONE WOULD BE ROSS PEROT MANY YEARS AGO. BUT, HE DID NOT TAKE MONEY. I HAVE TURNED DOWN SO MUCH. PEOPLE COMING UP, $10 MILLION, DONALD WE WANT TO GIVE YOU $10 MILLION FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN. $5 MILLION, $2 MILLION, $1  MILLION, JEB BUSH HAD $100,000 OR SO.  I DO KNOW -- I DO NOT KNOW IF I  GET CREDIT FOR IT. MANY PEOPLE SAY, I LIKE DONALD  TRUMP, I LIKE TED CRUZ, THAT IS  NOT A VERY COMPARISON.  I AM SO MUCH BETTER.   I WOULD DO A SUMMIT  BETTER JOB. I WILL DO SO MUCH BETTER. NOT EVEN CLOSE, BUT I WILL DO SO  MUCH BETTER. YOU KNOW WHY, BECAUSE I AM  WORKING FOR YOU.  THEY TALK ABOUT WORKING FOR YOU, BUT THEY ARE NOT.  THEY ARE WORKING FOR THE NEXT  ELECTION, CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS, WHAT ELSE?  WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE THEY TAKE?  WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE THEY WORK  FOR? THEY ARE WORKING AT A MINIMUM  CAMPAIGN CONSERVATION. PEOPLE COME UP TO ME -- OUR POLITICIANS ARE SO STUPID, WHY  WOULD THEY MAKE DEALS LIKE THAT? THERE WAS A DEAL RECENTLY, A COMMITTEE MADE AN INCREDIBLE  DEAL AND POLITICIANS APPROVED  IT. AND PEOPLE SAY, POLITICIANS ARE  SO STUPID. NO, THEY ARE REPRESENT BY THE SMARTEST PEOPLE THEY HAVE EVER  SEEN, SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, LOBBYISTS. SOME OF THESE GUYS, IT SAYS TED  CRUZ, THE LOBBYIST, TATTOOED ON THEIR FOREHEAD. I CAN DEAL WITH TED CRUZ. THEY RAISE A LOT OF MONEY FOR  HIM. AND WHEN THEY NEED A VOTE, I AM  NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR THAT.  YOU HAVE TO, WE GAVE YOU $2  MILLION FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN WHEN NOBODY ELSE WOULD PUT UP THE  MONEY. DO I KNOW THIS IS THE BETTER THAN ANYBODY? ON JUNE 16, I ONLY STARTED THIS POLITICAL STUFF ON JUNE 16, I WAS BEFORE THAT, A BIG  CONTRIBUTOR. IT IS A SYSTEM, IT IS NOT GOOD. IT IS A SYSTEM AND IT IS WHAT WE HAVE.  YOU HAVE GUYS -- IT SAYS HILLARY ON THIS GUY'S FOREHEAD. YOU GO TO HIM, YOU WANT HILLARY. YOU GO TO ANOTHER GUY IF YOU  WANT JOHN KASICH. ANOTHER GUY IF YOU WANT TED CRUZ. 100%, 100%, BY THE WAY, THEY  WILL NOT ALWAYS GET WHAT THEY  WANT. MAYBE 90%. THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU CANNOT  DO. BUT THEY GET WHAT THEY WANT A  LOT, THEY ARE PROFESSIONALS.  THEY ARE VERY GOOD AT IT. SO, WHEN I AM SELF FUNDING, I  HOPE PEOPLE APPRECIATE IT. IT MEANS A LOT, I DO NOT GO  ANYBODY, ANYTHING.  I DO NOT ONWE THEM.   AND I SAID ON THE WAY UP, SO FAR I HAVE INVESTED $35 MILLION, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. MY MONEY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, IT HAS NO  IMPACT ON ME.  LOOK, I BUILT A GREAT COMPANY,  AND AMAZING COMPANY WITH CASH  FLOW AND SOME OF THE GREATEST  ASSETS IN THE WORLD, WORTH OVER $10 BILLION. I STARTED WITH A VERY SMALL LOAN  AND CREATED A GREAT COMPANY,  SOME OF THE GREAT ASSETS AND TREMENDOUSLY LOW DEBT. THE REASON I TELL YOU THAT, THAT  IS THE KIND OF THINKING WE NEED  IN THE COUNTRY TO SOLVE MANY OF  OUR PROBLEMS.   MANY. BECAUSE FOLKS, THEY HAVE ALL OF THOSE CAMERAS, WE ARE RIGHT NOW  SITTING ON SOMETHING THAT WILL EXPLODE AND IT WILL BE A BAD SITUATION. WE BETTER GET RID OF DEBT AND WE BETTER STRAIGHTEN OURSELVES OUT. WE HAVE DEBT ON DEBT, ON DEBT.   AND ONE OF THE THINGS  WE WILL TALK ABOUT, WE WILL TALK  ABOUT A COUPLE OF THESE THINGS,  IT AFFECTS YOU VERY MUCH AND WE PROBABLY HAVE BUSINESS OWNERS  HERE. WE NEED TO GET RID OF THAT. WE WILL START WITH OBAMACARE,  THAT IS A KILLER FOR YOU AND TO THE COUNTRY. IT IS A KILLER. OBAMACARE IS TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE COUNTRY TO AFFORD AND IT DOES NOT WORK. FOR ANYBODY, IT DOES NOT WORK. YOU GO 65% INCREASES THIS YEAR  AND PEOPLE TELLING ME THAT THEY  HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE  IT. IT FOLDS, IT CLOSES UP,  OBAMACARE WILL CLOSE UP. WHEN YOU HAVE IT, IT IS NO GOOD  ANYWAYS. WE WILL TERMINATE AT AND WE WILL END UP WITH A GREAT HEALTH CARE PLAN THAT WILL COST YOU LESS  MONEY AND BE MUCH BETTER.   I LOVE THESE YOUNG KIDS, LOOK AT THESE BEAUTIFUL KIDS. THEY ARE GOING CRAZY. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT  OBAMACARE, THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT  IT IS, BUT HOPEFULLY THEY WILL  NOT NEED HEALTH CARE FOR 40  YEARS. BUT THEY ARE STILL ENTHUSIASTIC. THEY DO NOT LIKE OBAMACARE AND  HOPEFULLY THEY WILL NOT NEED TO  WORRY ABOUT IT. ULTIMATELY, THEY NEED TO WORRY  ABOUT THE COST, BECAUSE IT IS UNBEARABLE.  THE KIND OF MONEY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS UNBEARABLE. WE ARE GOING TO END, GORE, WE  ARE GOING TO BRING EDUCATION -- WE WILL PROTECT OUR SECOND  AMENDMENT, WE ARE GOING TO DO  ALL OF THE THINGS YOU HEARD ME SAYING.  ALL OF IT.   HERE IS WHAT I WANT  TO TALK ABOUT, BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BIG NUMBERS. $19 TRILLION, WE CANNOT TALK THE  LITTLE STUFF. THERE IS GOING TO BE CUTS OF THINGS YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE. WE WILL SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY,  CAUGHT -- CUT ALL OF THE FRAUD. YOU DO NOT MIND CUTTING THE  FRAUD OUT? WE ARE GOOD TO TAKE CARE OF THE  VETS AND BUILD THE MILITARY, BIGGER, STRONGER THAN EVER  BEFORE.  MR.  --    BEAUTIFUL, GREAT. ISN'T THAT GREAT, WHEN YOU SEE  YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE THAT? THEY ARE GOING TO BE VERY  SUCCESSFUL. DO NOT FORGET, THEY ARE AFTER  OUR JOBS. THEY HAVE NO CHOICE, THEY NEED  TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM US.  YOU WILL TREAT US NICELY.  THAT IS THE NEXT DONALD TRUMP,  BIGGER AND BETTER.  NOT EVEN A CONTEST.  GOOD LUCK, KIDS. WHAT ABOUT THE ONE IN THE  MIDDLE, ARE YOU GOING TO BE THE  MOST SUCCESSFUL? GREAT. GREAT JOB. THAT IS WHAT WE LOVE TO SEE. MY DAUGHTER JUST HAD A BEAUTIFUL , BEAUTIFUL SON.   AND, ULTIMATELY THAT  IS WHAT WE FIGHT FOR. THAT AND THE GRANDCHILDREN, WE  ARE GOING TO TURN THIS THING AROUND FAST. LET'S TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS. WE ARE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR THE WORLD AND THE ENTIRE WORLD,  MANY OF THESE PLACES THAT WE ARE TAKING CARE OF OUR VERY RICH. WE TAKE CARE OF SAUDI ARABIA,  THEY MADE A BILLION DOLLARS A DAY WHEN OIL PRICES WERE UP, NOW THEY MAKE A LITTLE LESS.  BIG DEAL. WHAT? IMPORTS -- HE IS RIGHT. YOU NEVER KNOW, IS HE ON OUR SIDE? BUT WE TAKE CARE OF SAUDI  ARABIA. NOW, NOBODY IS GOING TO MESS WITH SAUDI ARABIA BECAUSE WE ARE WATCHING THEM. THEY HAVE A FUND SO BIG, NOBODY  HAS EVER SEEN A FUND LIKE THAT. OIL POURING OUT OF THE GROUND, VERY HIGH QUALITY OIL. SO THEY MAKE NOTHING BUT MONEY.  IF IT WAS NOT FOR US, THEY WOULD  NOT BE THERE VERY LONG. THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE, EVERYTHING  IS FINE. BUT WE ARE LOSING A FORTUNE. IF WE HAD A PERSON LIKE ME, LIKE OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, MAYBE  SOME. YOU HAVE SOME PEOPLE IN THE ROOM THAT WOULD DO A GOOD JOB.  AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT  DO GOOD, LIKE PEOPLE WE HAVE  RIGHT NOW. NOBODY COULD DO WORSE. SO, WE'RE PROTECTING SAUDI ARABIA. AND THEY ARE PAYING -- AND THEY ARE NOT PAYING US A FAIR PRICE. WHY ARE WE PAYING RENT FOR OUR  MILITARY BASES? WHY DO WE HAVE ANY RENT? I AM NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT RIGHT, I AM TALKING ABOUT REALLY  BIG NUMBERS. JAPAN, GREAT COUNTRY. THEY MAY CARS, SELL THEM. WE HAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITH JAPAN, THEY SELL US CARS AND WE SELL PRACTICALLY NOTHING, THAT  IS A TRADE IMBALANCE.  ONE OF THE GREAT IMBALANCES OF  ALL TIME. LOS ANGELES, I SEE THESE MASSIVE SHIPS COME IN.  THIS IS LIKE NASCAR.  BY THE WAY, MANY DRIVERS OF  NASCAR ENDORSE TRUMP, YOU KNOW  THAT RIGHT? THE GREAT BRIAN FRANCE. THEY DO A GREAT JOB. THANK YOU. BUT, THEY ENDORSE -- BRIAN SAID,  I WANT TO ENDORSE YOU. HE DID IT IN NORTH CAROLINA. GOOD PLACE TO ENDORSE. IT WOULD NOT BE BAD UP HERE,  EITHER. BUT WE HAVE IT. NOT ONLY SARAH PALIN, WE HAVE  JERRY FALWELL JUNIOR, JOE FROM  ARIZONA, SHERIFF JOE. HOW ABOUT SHERIFF JOE? OK?   CHRIS CHRISTIE HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. DR. BEN CARSON WHO HAS BEEN  AMAZING. AMAZING. WHAT A GREAT GUY.  AND WE HAVE SO MANY OTHERS, CONGRESSMAN NOW, SENATOR SESSIONS, ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED PEOPLE IN THE SENATE, WHO TED CRUZ THOUGHT THAT HE  HAD. HE KEPT TALKING ABOUT SESSIONS  AND WE WOULD SAY, SENATOR SESSIONS, THEN HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP. ALL OF A SUDDEN, TED CRUZ  DID NOT TALK ABOUT HIM. A LOT OF THINGS WILL HAPPEN. ONE THING WE WILL DO IS THE MILITARY BID WE ARE THE POLICEMAN OF THE WORLD --  MILITARY. WE ARE THE POLICEMAN OF THE WORLD. BUT THESE ARE REALLY WEALTHY  COUNTRIES. NOT NECESSARILY POWERFUL,  BECAUSE WE PROTECT THEM. AND IT IS OK. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, WHEN THEY  START PAYING US AND WE DO TRADE DEALS, THIS COUNTRY IS ALREADY  TURNED AROUND.   BECAUSE WE ARE  TALKING ABOUT BIG DOLLARS. AND LYING TED CANNOT DO IT.  IN ALL FAIRNESS, NUMBER ONE,  THEY WILL FIND OUT THAT HE IS A  LIAR. YOU KNOW, THE EVANGELICALS, THEY  ARE WITH ME.   THE EVANGELICALS -- REMEMBER SOUTH CAROLINA? THAT WAS GOING TO BE TED, LYING TED WAS GOING TO WIN THAT ONE  EASILY, BECAUSE EVANGELICALS -- RIGHT? LET'S GET GOING.  I THINK THAT YOU GUYS ARE ONLY  28%. GO TO CHURCH.  THOSE ARE THE ONES. DO YOU GO TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY? ANYTIME YOU CAN GO.  DO YOU GO? SO 68% EVANGELICALS, AND WE WON  EVERYTHING. WE WON SO MUCH. TO SHOW YOU, TED, DID YOU SEE IT? I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN BEAT DONALD TRUMP. I HAVE BEATEN HIM FIVE TIMES.  AND HE IS SCREAMING, HE WISHES THAT HE HAD THE BIBLE IN HIS  HANDS, BUT HE PICKS UP THE BIBLE  AND PUT IT DOWN AND HE LIES.  AND IT SAYS, IBM -- I BEAT HIM  SIX TIMES.  AND I SAID, YEAH, BUT I HAVE  BEATEN YOU 22 TIMES. REMEMBER THE FACE?   I THINK WE HAVE LIKE  21 OR 22 STATES ALREADY, BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ONE. YOU NEED TO DO ME A FAVOR, VOTE. I WILL DO SUCH A GOOD JOB FOR  YOU. DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR.   YOU ARE PROBABLY  DOING ME A FAVOR IF YOU DO NOT  VOTE FOR ME, I WILL GO HOME AND  RELAX. SO MANY PEOPLE ASK THE QUESTION. THIS MORNING, I WAS INTERVIEWED  BY A VERY GOOD RADIO GUY. BUT SOME ARE BAD, YOU KNOW THIS GUY NAMED SYKES? LISTEN TO THE WHOLE INTERVIEW,  EVERYBODY WHO LISTENED TO THAT SHOW WOULD VOTE FOR ME. DO NOT HANG UP, TAKE ON THE  ENEMY. YOU ABSOLUTELY TAKE THEM ON.   BUT, HE IS NOT A VERY TALENTED GUY OR SMART GUY.  BUT THE GUY THAT INTERVIEWED ME  TODAY, HE WAS A SMART GUY. AND IT WAS NATIONAL. HE INTERVIEWS ME AND SAYS, WE  ARE ON THE PHONE, IT IS EARLY  SATURDAY MORNING AND I SAID,  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HE SAID, MR. TRUMP, ONE FINAL  QUESTION. WHAT? YOU ARE WORTH A FORTUNE, YOU  HAVE A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY, YOU CAN  DO ANYTHING YOU WANT, WHY ARE  YOU DOING THIS? AND, THAT QUESTION HAS BEEN ASKED OF ME MORE THAN ANY OTHER  QUESTION, OTHER THAN STUDENT DEBT. WHEN I AM AROUND STUDENTS, THEY  GRADUATE, THEY CANNOT GET A JOB  AND IT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. BUT THAT QUESTION IS ASKED SO MUCH, AND I SAID, I HAVE BEEN SO  LUCKY IN THIS COUNTRY AND I HAVE DONE SO WELL AND MADE SO MUCH MONEY, AND I HAVE ENJOYED MY LIFE AND I HAVE HOPEFULLY SOME  REALLY GOOD YEARS LEFT AND I  WANT TO GIVE BACK. I JUST WANT TO GIVE SOMETHING  BACK.   THAT IS ALL IT IS. THAT IS ALL IT IS.  MR.  --  [CHANTING  THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, OUR THEME, MAKE  AMERICA GREAT AGAIN -- WE ARE  GOING TO MAKE IT SO GREAT. WE ALWAYS HAVE A PROBLEM, THE PROBLEM WITH TRANSLATION BECAUSE  THE PRESS IS SO DISHONEST.  YOU HAVE NO IDEA.  IT IS AMAZING HOW SMART THE  PEOPLE ARE. LOOK, THE PEOPLE GET IT. THEY ARE REALLY DISHONEST.  THEY WILL PUT 1/10 OF A SENTENCE IN. AND WORSE, THE CAMERAS. YOU KNOW, I USED TO SAY, ""I LOVE TELEVISION."" BUT THE PRESS IS VERY DISHONEST. NOW WE HAVE A NEW TRADE DEAL  CALLED THE TTP, TRANS PACIFIC -- TRADE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. IT IS TERRIBLE. IT IS WORSE THAN NAFTA. I GUARANTEE THAT MOST PEOPLE  HAVE NEVER READ IT. ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES THINK IT IS STUNNING AND THEY ANALYZE IT  AND WE DESIGNED IT. FIRST OF ALL, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE  SIGNED.  WE SHOULD SIGN WITH ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, NOT 12, BUT WE SHOULD HAVE NOT DONE IT.  IT IS TOO COMPLICATED, IT IS A DAD DEAL, TED CRUZ IS TOTALLY IN  FAVOR FOR IT. JOHN KASICH, WHO VOTED FOR  NAFTA, IS IN FAVOR FOR IT. PEOPLE WHO SAID, ""YOU ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR THAT DEAL, SEE YOU  ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS""  TELL HIM HE HAS NO CHOICE, SO HE  IS GOING TO VOTE FOR IT. THERE ARE PEOPLE IN CONGRESS WHO  DON'T WANT IT. THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING HONEST.  THE BIGGEST POINT OF THE DEAL IS DEVALUING MONETARY POLICY. CHINA TAKES THE MOST ADVANTAGE OF THE DEVALUING OF CURRENCY.  THEY KILL US. THIS YEAR, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A $500 BILLION TRADE DEFICIT  WITH CHINA. MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT YOU'RE  GOING TO BE SO RICH, SO FAST, BUT I'M A BUSINESSMAN, I KNOW BUSINESS, AND UNDER ME, YOU ARE  GOING TO BE SO RICH, SO FAST.   YOU JUST DON'T KNOW  HOW RICH YOU ARE GOING TO BE.  WE ARE GOING FROM A DEBTOR NATION. YOU HAVE TED CRUZ WHO REFUSED TO  APPROVE ANY LANGUAGE ON  DEVALUATION.  ANY LANGUAGE ON MONETARY  MANIPULATION. THAT IS WHERE THEY BEAT US,  FOLKS. THEY DEVALUED THEIR CURRENCY SO  MUCH, AND THAT WE SEE OUR DOLLAR  HOLDING AND GOING UP. THEY WANT OUR DOLLAR TO GO UP. IT SOUNDS GOOD. IN THE MEANTIME, KOMATSU IS  KILLING CATERPILLAR. LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MEXICO. MEXICO IS TAKING OUR BUSINESSES,  NOT ONLY FOR TO VALUATION, BUT  FOR OTHER PROBLEMS.  POLITICIANS DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY ARE DOING. SO LOOK. WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THINGS,  AND THAT IS BIG MONEY, THOSE  BEGINS. I HAVE CARL ICAHN AND OTHER BIG  BUSINESSMAN. WE USED POLITICAL HACKS,  THIRD-RATE POLITICAL SLOBS, TO  NEGOTIATE WITH THE SMARTEST  PEOPLE IN CHINA, THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN JAPAN, AND WE HAVE ALL THE CARDS. PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IT. WITHOUT THIS BIG POT OF MONEY  THAT IS BEING DRAINED OUT OF  YOUR POCKET -- AND BY THE WAY, I  HAVE TO DO THIS, BECAUSE I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE TO, BUT I  WANT TO REDO SOME STATISTICS. SO WHERE AM I TALKING ABOUT? 20% OF THE MANUFACTURING JOBS  HAVE LEFT SINCE 2000. YOU KNOW OR THAT IS? WISCONSIN -- KNOW WHERE THAT IS? WISCONSIN. WISCONSIN CHRONICALLY LEGS THE  REST OF THE UNITED STATES IN JOB  CREATION. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH SCOTT  WALKER, AND I COULD ONLY SAY  THIS BECAUSE I COULDN'T ASK FOR  HIS ENDORSEMENT. WHAT I DID TO THAT POOR GUY,  MAN.    AND HE IS A NICE PERSON, BUT WHO CARES? I DON'T CARE IF HE IS NICE, I  WANT TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY RICH  IN GOOD AGAIN. OK, SO IT CHRONICALLY LAGS THE  REST OF THE COUNTRY. I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND IT IS LIKE I'M STANDING ON A  MOTORCYCLE OR SOMETHING. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, EVERY TIME  I GO SOMEPLACE, BIKERS EVERYWHERE, ANY BIKERS AND HERE? -- BIKERS IN HERE? THE BIKERS LOVE ME.  AND I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE LIMOUSINE, BUT YOU ARE GREAT  PEOPLE. WE HAD HUNDREDS CLOSE TO 1000 BIKES, AND I WONDERED WHAT WAS  GOING ON. THEY ARE OUT THERE WAITING FOR ME TO GIVE A SPEECH, IT WAS A BIG GROUP, IT WAS INCREDIBLE, BUT THERE HAD TO BE 1000 BIKES, MOSTLY HARLEYS, IN ALL FAIRNESS, I LOVE HARLEYS. AND I BY WARSAW WINDOWS. -- I BUY WARSAW WINDOWS. DOES ANYBODY KNOW ABOUT WARSAW  WINDOWS? I BUILD ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE  AND THERE ARE GREAT WINDOWS IN THERE AND I AM BUILDING ANOTHER  HOTEL AND IT IS WAY AHEAD OF  SCHEDULE AND UNDER BUDGET. THERE IS OVER 3000% OF COST  OVERRUN. 3000%. BUT WARSAW WINDOWS, I BUILT A  BUILDING ON WALL STREET WITH  WARSAW WINDOWS.  SAY HELLO TO WARSAW WINDOWS FOR ME, WOULD YOU? SAY HELLO. HONESTLY, IT IS ONE OF THE BEST  WINDOWS MADE IN THE WORLD.  I SAID, WARSAW, THAT MUST BE  WHERE THEY MAKE THE WINDOWS, BUT  WE DID A FULL BUILDING, ON WALL STREET, USING 3500 WARSAW  WINDOWS. THAT IS A LOT OF WINDOWS, RIGHT? AND THERE ARE NO LEAKS. WE HAVE NO LEAKS. I SHOULD SAY THEY LEAKS LIKE HELL AND GET A REFUND, RIGHT? I DO THAT, TOO, SOMETIMES. ANYWAY, SO WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR  COUNTRY SO STRONG AND WHAT WE DO IT IS WITH THE BIG STUFF AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR AREA,  WISCONSIN HAS TO KEEP WAGES  DEPRESSED IN ORDER TO HOLD ONTO  JOBS. THAT IS BECAUSE OF FOREIGN  COMPETITION. THAT IS GOOD, THAT IS FINE FOR FOREIGN COMPETITION, BUT NOT FOR  YOU. PEOPLE HAVEN'T HAD AN EFFECTIVE WAGE INCREASE IN 20 YEARS. YOU HAVE ANOTHER CANDIDATE THAT HAD, LIKE, 300 PEOPLE, BUT WE  HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE  LISTENING TO A SPEAKER. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ANGRY AND  THEY ARE DISGUSTED AT WHAT IS  GOING ON. SO WE HAVE THOUSANDS RIGHT NOW,  WE HAVE PEOPLE ALL OVER THIS  COUNTRY THAT ARE WORKING HARD,  AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING  PART-TIME JOBS. THEY NEVER HAD A PART-TIME JOB  IN THEIR LIFE, WHAT BECAUSE OF  OBAMACARE, IT MAKES SENSE FOR  THE COMPANY TO MAKE EVERYTHING  PART-TIME. FOR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. SO IT'S TERRIBLE. SO THE NEW JOBS IS COMING LARGELY FROM HEALTH CARE, WHICH ARE VERY WELL-PAYING JOBS, IT  CLAIMS, WHICH IS ABOUT $125 PER WEEK.  THAT IS NOT GOOD. WAGES IN MANUFACTURING MAKE IT  LIKE A LOW-WAGE NATION IN WISCONSIN, OK? AND I'VE HEARD THIS, HOUSEHOLD INCOME HAS HAD A MAJOR DECLINE. THIS IS WISCONSIN. BY THE WAY, THIS IS LARGELY  COUNTRY, JUST A YOU UNDERSTAND. LARGE, LARGE DECLINE IN HOUSEHOLD INCOME, AND THAT HAS  TAKEN PLACE SINCE THE YEAR 2000. SO SINCE THE YEAR 2000, YOU HAVE  HAD A DECLINE. WISCONSIN IS JUST IN THE MIDDLE  OF THE PACK. SO YOU HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO ENDORSED HIM, TED CRUZ, AND  PEOPLE OF THE GOVERNOR, SO DO I,  SO HE IS FIGHTING AND FIGHTING  AND FIGHTING. SOMEBODY SAID IF HE GIVES YOU A  CALL UP, I WOULD SAY, WHAT THE  HELL DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? NOW LET'S SAY I DIDN'T RUN  AGAIN, OK? AND LET'S SAY I WANTED SOMETHING  IN WISCONSIN AND I CALL HIM UP, ""GOVERNOR, HOW ARE YOU DOING,  GOVERNOR? LISTEN, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, I  WANT TO BUILD SOMETHING IN  WISCONSIN."" DO YOU THINK HE WOULD BE HAPPY  ABOUT IT? I THINK SO, RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOOD, I  DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BAD, BUT  BELIEVE ME, IT'S WRONG BECAUSE  IT IS WRONG FOR THE PEOPLE. PEOPLE HAVEN'T HAD AN INCREASE IN WAGES COUNTRYWIDE,  NATIONWIDE, THE BLUE COLLARS. THE WALL STREET GUYS, I KNOW THE  WALL STREET GUYS SO WELL. THEY HAVE CARRIED INTEREST PROVISIONS, THE HAVE PROVISIONS  THAT NOBODY IN THIS ROOM EVEN  UNDERSTANDS, EXCEPT ONE PERSON,  I UNDERSTAND IT. I UNDERSTAND IT AND WE'RE GOING  TO END IT FOLKS, WE ARE GOING TO  END IT.  I AM DOING WELL.  I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT WELL.  I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT  WELL. IT DOESN'T MATTER. SOME BUT HE SAID, ""HOW WOULD YOU DO IF YOU DIDN'T RUN YOUR BUSINESS?"" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT IS  SO ON INSPIRING TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SO STRONG AGAIN. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE IT  STRONG. WE HAVE TO MAKE IT RICH. A WOMAN SAID, ""MR. TRUMP, I LOVE YOU, I AM GOING TO VOTE FOR YOU,  BUT PLEASE DON'T SAY, WE ARE  GOING TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY RICH  AGAIN, IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD."" AND I SAID, ""YOU ARE RIGHT, BECAUSE IF WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY RICH AGAIN, YOU'RE  GOING TO HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY CUTS UNDER JOHN KASICH OR TED  CRUZ, BUT I'M GOING TO GIVE A  HUGE TAX INCREASE -- TAX CUT INCREASE."" I SPENT $35 MILLION OR $45 MILLION AND THE OTHER GUYS HAVE SPENT $150 MILLION. I MEAN, JEB BUSH SPENT 145 ILION DOLL -- 140 $5 MILLION.  WILL ANYBODY EVER FORGIVE ME FOR THAT TERM? THAT TERM IS A KILLER. I AM DOWN TO THE TWO LEFTOVERS. I HAD 17 PEOPLE AND NOW WE ARE  DOWN TO TWO. ISN'T IT NICE WHEN YOU THINK OF  IT? ISN'T IT NICE?   AND, AND, WE ARE  LEADING BIG AGAINST THE TWO. WISCONSIN IS VERY IMPORTANT  BECAUSE IF I CAN WIN WISCONSIN, YOU PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE LOW TAXES, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE  JOBS, WE ARE GOING TO BRING JOBS THAT, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR PICK OF JOBS, YOU ARE NOT JUST GOING TO PICK A JOB BECAUSE YOU  HAVE NO CHOICE, WE ARE GOING TO BRINGG JOBS BACK INTO THIS  COUNTRY.  WE ARE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD.  YOU SAW CARRIER AIR CONDITIONERS  JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO MOVE INTO  MEXICO. THAT'S NOT GOOD TO HAPPEN. YOU ARE HAVING PFIZER MOVE TO  IRELAND.  I AM TELLING YOU, THESE  COMPANIES ARE HIGH AND REGULATIONS ARE TOO TIGHT.  WHO IS TROUBLED BY REGULATIONS  IN THIS COUNTRY? RIGHT? IT IS TERRIBLE.  I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE FARMERS  THAT CAN'T EVEN FORM THEIR LANDS  BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY  REGULATIONS. IF I SAY HAD TO SHOVEL IT OUT OF THE GROUND. WE ARE GOING TO END ALL THAT.  WE ARE GOING TO END ALL THAT. IT IS SO IMPORTANT.  HERE'S THE THING. WE HAVE GOT TO GO OUT AND WE  HAVE GOT TO VOTE. LET ME GIVE YOU ONE OTHER ITEM BECAUSE IT IS SO IMPORTANT. I HEARD TED CRUZ TODAY SAY -- NOW, I HAVE BEEN A BUSINESSMAN AND I MADE A LOT OF MONEY, MADE  A LOT OF MONEY AGAINST CHINA,  MADE TREMENDOUS DEALS AGAINST  CHINA. THEY CAN BE BEATEN FOLKS. THEY CAN BE BEATEN. IN TRADE. YOU KNOW, THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN  CHINA, FRIENDS OF MINE, THEY SAY, ""DONALD, WE CAN'T BELIEVE A  WE GET AWAY WITH."" THIS IS BEFORE I WAS RUNNING FOR  PRESIDENT. NOW THEY SAY, ""I DIDN'T SAY  THAT."" BUT THEY SAID IT. WATCHING TELEVISION, I SAY, WOW,  THAT IS TERRIBLE. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR,  AND I SAID, JAPAN SHOULD HAVE  NUCLEAR. THAT IS WHAT I SAID, SUPPOSEDLY. THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED TO  BE RECENTLY ON TELEVISION BY A VERY GOOD ANNOUNCER, A VERY GOOD  GUY, HE SAID, ""WHAT ABOUT NATO?"" RIGHT? IN ALL FAIRNESS, I HAVE BEEN  ENTRE NOUS ARE -- ENTREPRENEUR,  A VERY GOOD ONE, BUT I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT NATO.  HERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH NATO.  IT IS OBSOLETE. I LEARNED QUICKLY.  I KNEW IT WAS TRUE. IT IS 68 YEARS OLD.  IT WAS FORMED TO LOOK OVER THE SOVIET UNION WHICH DOESN'T EVEN  EXIST ANYMORE. AND I SAID IT IS OBSOLETE AND WE  PAY TOO MUCH MONEY. NOW WHEN I MADE THIS STATEMENT,  THOUGHT I READ IT SOMEWHERE, BUT  WHEN I MADE THE STATEMENT, IT  WAS REALLY THE STATEMENT THAT A  LOT OF PEOPLE SAID, HOW WOULD  YOU KNOW A THING LIKE THAT? SO IT TURNS OUT THAT THINGS ARE  WORSE THAN EVERYBODY THOUGHT. WE'RE PLAYING -- WE ARE PAYING  SO MUCH MONEY HERE THE UNITED  STATES, WHICH IS ALL OF US, WE  ARE TALKING ABOUT SERIOUS,  SERIOUS MONEY.  OK? WE ARE NOT ONLY TAKING CARE OF GERMANY, WE ARE TAKING CARE OF  JAPAN, THIS, THAT, AND THE  OTHER, BUT NATO IS NOT PAYING  THE BILLS, AND WHY SHOULD THEY? BECAUSE NOBODY ASKS THEM TO PAY. I AM GOING TO SAY, ""PAY UP."" AND THEY ARE GOING TO PAY UP. AND I WILL DO IT NICELY.  I WILL ASK NICELY AND DO IT VERY  PRESIDENTIAL. I WILL ASK IT AND AT THE SAME TIME GET THE MONEY.  OK? YOU CAN'T GET TO PRESIDENTIAL.   IF YOU ARE TO PRESIDENTIAL -- TOO PRESIDENTIAL.   IF YOU ARE TOO PRESIDENTIAL, YOU WON'T IF THE  MONEY. ONE OF THESE COUNTRIES, AND I  WILL NOT NAME ANY NAMES, BUT  THEY WILL SAY, I DON'T WANT TO  GIVE MONEY. I AM LIKE A REALLY SMART PERSON.  I CAN BE A PRESIDENTIAL PRESIDENT.  I CAN BE BORING, THAT IS OK. BUT LOOK, WE ARE GOING TO GET THESE COUNTRIES TO PAY, AND NOT  ONLY TO PAY, NOT ONLY TO PAY,  BUT TO PAY ALL OF THIS MONEY FOR  YEARS. WE HAVE BEEN CARRYING THESE  COUNTRIES. MANY OF THEM ARE RICH COUNTRIES. SOME OF THEM HAVE THE MONEY TO  PAY. AND THEN YOU SAFE TO YOURSELF, ""WHAT ARE WE GETTING AT HERE? -- SAY TO YOURSELF, ""WHAT ARE WE  GETTING AT HERE?"" WELL, TAKE A LOOK AT UKRAINE. THESE THREE OR FOUR COUNTRIES THAT SURROUND UKRAINE, DO YOU  EVER HEAR OF THEM COMPLAINING? WE DON'T WANT AGAIN TO WORLD WAR  III. AND YET, THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THE  NEIGHBORS, THEY DON'T REALLY  CARE.  OR THEY DON'T CARE MUCH.  BUT HERE IS THE THING. WHEN I TALK ABOUT ARMAMENT OR  WHEN I TALK ABOUT PROTECTION OR  WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE MILITARY, ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES, WHICH IS  MUCH OF THE WORLD, THAT WE ARE  TAKING CARE OF, THEY HAVE TO  PAY, AND I DO WANT TO BE, LIKE,  A GREEN PERSON, BUT WE ARE  LOSING A FORTUNE EVERYWHERE.  WE TAKE CARE OF SOUTH KOREA. WE HAVE 28,000 SOLDIERS ON THE  LINE BETWEEN THE NORTH AND THE  SOUTH, THE MANIA.  WE HAVE 20,000 SOLDIERS ON THE  LINE.   -- AS STUPID, STUPID  PEOPLE AS WORLD LEADERS. WE HAVE GOT TO STOP IT.  WE HAVE GOT TO STOP IT.   SO JAPAN IS A VERY BIG, VERY RICH COUNTRY, RIGHT? AND WE TAKE CARE OF JAPAN AND  GERMANY AND WITH THIS AND WITH THAT AND THIS TEST AND THIS JUGGERNAUT AND THIS PHENOMENAL, POWERFUL, RICH COUNTRY. AND SAUDI ARABIA, I TOLD YOU. THESE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THESE SERVICES, AND WHAT I SAID ABOUT JAPAN IS THIS, WE ARE PROTECTING JAPAN FROM MANY COUNTRIES, BUT WE ARE PROTECTED  JAPAN FROM NORTH KOREA.  EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT JAPAN, JAPAN, JAPAN, WHAT WE GET A TINY  FRACTION OF WHAT WE GET, BUT WE ARE PROTECTING JAPAN. SO I SAID SOMETHING TO THE  EFFECT THAT I WOULD, AND WITH GREAT RESPECT, I HAVE A LOT OF JAPANESE FRIENDS, THEY ARE GREAT  PEOPLE, WITH GREAT RESPECT, BUT IN FOUR YEARS, YOU ARE GOING TO  SAY THAT THIS GUY TURNED UP TO  BE A GREAT PRESIDENT, OR MAYBE EIGHT YEARS. YOU'RE GOING TO START SAYING IT IN TWO YEARS. TWO YEARS.  YOU WILL SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE. RIGHT NOW WE ARE AT A GREAT  DIVIDE. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A GREAT  DIVIDER AS PRESIDENT.  OK? HE IS A GREAT DIVIDER. SO I WOULD SAY TO JAPAN, ""YOU'VE GOT A HELP US OUT, WE WANT TO  HELP YOU."" AND I WOULD RATHER HAVE THEM NOT  ARMED, BUT I AM NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO LOSE THIS TREMENDOUS  AMOUNT OF MONEY, AND FRANKLY,  THE CASE COULD BE MADE TO LET  THEM PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST  NORTH KOREA. THEY WOULD PROBABLY WIPE THEM  OUT PRETTY QUICK. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE THING. IT LOOKS, FOLKS. IF THEY FIGHT, THAT WOULD BE  TERRIBLE. BUT IF THEY DO, THEY DO. WE CAN'T BE THE POLICE OF THE WORLD AND GET ALL OF THIS DEBT GOING AND WE ARE SITTING ON A  BUBBLE THAT IS GOING TO EXPLODE AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO END UP YOU KNOW WHERE. WE CAN'T DO IT. SO WHAT DID HAPPEN IS AFTER I  MADE MY STATEMENTS ABOUT NATO,  THE NEXT THING YOU SAW LAST WEEK  WAS THAT ""DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO  DISBAND THE NATO."" LOOK, SHE IS SMILING, IS IT  TRUE? I AM NOT SOME KIND OF A DOPEY GUY.  I AM SMART, I AM REALLY, REALLY SMART.  I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. I KNOW WHAT I'M  NOW THERE WOULD BE A  POINT WITH SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES WHERE WE WILL WALK AND  WE WON'T BE GONE FOR LONG AND  THEN THEY WILL CALL US AND SAY, ""COME BACK."" NOW I WOULD MUCH RATHER PROTECT  JAPAN, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS POSSIBLE TO LET THEM TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES HERE. BUT PROBABLY MORE LIKELY, THEY  WILL PAY ALSO A LOT MORE MONEY  AND WE WON'T BE LOSING ALL OF  THE VAST MILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE  ARE LOSING RIGHT NOW.  JUST TAKE A LOOK AT NATO.  I WAS SO RIGHT. AND NOW THESE PEOPLE WHO STUDIED  NATO FOR 30 YEARS, NOW THEY ARE SAYING, THAT WAS A BRILLIANT  SUGGESTION. ONE GUY WAS SAYING, ""HERE IS A  GUY STUDYING NATO AND HE NEVER  THOUGHT OF IT, HE SAID IT IS  OBSOLETE. I HAVE A NATURAL INSTANT FOR  THIS. BY THE WAY, UNITED NATIONS.  SAME THING, SMALLER NUMBER.  UNITED NATIONS. BELIEVE ME.   MANY OTHER THINGS. MANY OTHER THINGS. I LOVE THE UNITED NATIONS. THEY ARE WONDERFUL.  HAVE THEY EVER SETTLED ANYTHING? IT IS JUST LIKE A POLITICAL  GANG. THE UNITED NATIONS, WE PAY FOR A VAST -- I MEAN, THE AMOUNT OF  MONEY WE SPEND ON THE UNITED  NATIONS.  I WILL TELL YOU A STORY. A FEW YEARS AGO, FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO, I WAS GOING BEFORE  THE UNITED NATIONS, AND WE WERE  DOING A STUDY OF THE UNITED NATIONS'S BUILDINGS, WE WERE  DOING A RENOVATION, SO THE IN  BASSETT OR TO SWEETEN UP A TIME, I BELIEVE IT WAS SWEDEN, CALLED ME AND MENTIONED THE BUILDING FOR 92 STORIES FOR 306 $2 BILLION RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE  UNITED NATIONS. HE CALLED ME AND HE WAS VERY  NICE AND HE SAID ""DISTRICT ROMP, I HEARD YOU SPENT $360 BILLION  ON A BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET, AND -- ""MR. TRUMP, I HEARD YOU SPENT $360 BILLION ON A BUILDING  ACROSS THE STREET."" HE SAID, ""COULD I ASK YOU A  QUESTION -- WHY?"" AND I SAID, ""NUMBER ONE, THEY  ARE CROOKED, AND NUMBER TWO, IT  EQUALS KNOWLEDGE."" I MET WITH KOFI ANON AND I SAID  I WOULD DO THE WHOLE JOB FOR  LESS. HE SAID IT WOULD NOT BE THE SAME  JOB AND I SAID, YOU ARE RIGHT, IT WILL BE MUCH BETTER.   I EXPLAINED TO  HIM THAT I USE MARBLE AND THAT  YOU WOULD USE LINOLEUM, OK? I SAID IT WILL BE MUCH BETTER,  100% THAT ARE. BOTTOM LINE, I NEVER HEARD FROM  THEM AGAIN. THEN THE UNITED STATES SENATE  CALLED ME AND THEY SAID, HOW CAN YOU DO IT FOR $500 MILLION, WITH WHY COULD YOU DO IT WITH  THAT BUT YOU QUOTE THEM $1.5 BILLION? I SAID IT WILL COST THEM $3 BILLION OR MAYBE MORE THAN THAT,  AND THAT WAS YEARS AGO.  IT WILL COST THEM MUCH MORE EVEN  THAN WHAT I SAID. IT WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST MESSES YOU HAVE EVER SEEN AND I  ASKED THE HITMAN OF  CONSTRUCTION, I SAID, ""LET ME  ASK YOU, ARE YOU GOING TO USE  NEW YORK STEAM?"" IT IS A VERY COMPLEX SYSTEM OF STEAM UNDER NEW YORK.  HE SAID, ""WHAT'S THAT?"" HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS  TALKING ABOUT.  I SAID, ""HOW CAN YOU BE IN CHARGE OF A MASSIVE CONSTRUCTION PROBLEM WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT  A FIVE PIPE OR A FOUR PIPE, OR A TWO PIPE SYSTEM IS?"" SO HERE IS THE STORY, WE ARE  GOING TO REBUILD OUR COUNTRY. WE NEED ROADS, WE NEED BRIDGES, YOU KNOW WANT? OUR BRIDGES ARE FALLING DOWN. WE ARE GOING TO SAVE SO MUCH. YOU'RE GOING TO GO OUT AND VOTE  AND YOU WILL BE SO PROUD OF WHAT  TOOK PLACE TODAY AND YOU ARE  GOING TO BE BE EVEN MORE PROUD -- GOING TO BE EVEN MORE PROUD OF WHAT HAPPENS ON TUESDAY. BUT YOU KNOW THAT.  YOU ARE GOING TO BE VERY PROUD.   YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THESE POLITICIANS, A LOT OF THESE POLITICIANS, THEY GET UP  AND SAY, ""YOU ARE AMERICANS, YOU GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU VOTE FOR ME, ORBITAL  FOR MY OPPONENT, WHAT IS  IMPORTANT TO GET OUT AND VOTE --  VOTE FOR ME OR VOTE FOR MY OPPONENT, WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS  YOU GET OUT AND VOTE."" BUT I SAY YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR  ME.  I UNDERSTAND NATURE. YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE LIFE. WE ARE ALL ANGRY BUT WE ARE GOOD  PEOPLE BUT WE ARE NOT REALLY ANGRY PEOPLE BUT WE LOVE OUR  COUNTRY AND IT IS BEING RUN BY IDIOTS AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE DOING.  AND JUST TO FINISH ON THE NUCLEAR THING, I WAS TALKING ABOUT NEGOTIATING WITH JAPAN AND  NEGOTIATE WITH GERMANY AND I  HAVE SUCH NEGOTIATORS IN THE WORLD, CARL ICAHN, OTHER NEGOTIATORS, A LOT OF PEOPLE  WANT TO COME IN AND HELP US,  SOME OF THE GREATEST BUSINESS MINDS, AND THEY ALL WANT TO HELP  US, SO I SAY TO MYSELF, ""LOOK AT  THIS, LOOK AT THESE PEOPLE, AND  LOOK AT THIS NEGOTIATION. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN? WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN?"" IF OUR COUNTRY, IF WE DON'T DO THIS DEAL, IF WE DON'T GET THE PROPER PEOPLE IN OFFICE SOON, WE  ARE NOT GOOD TO HAVE A COUNTRY LEFT, I AM TELLING YOU, WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY LEFT.  IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. AND I AM A PERSON WITH COMMON  SENSE, AND I USED TO SAY -- OK,  REMEMBER THE BEGINNING OF THE  CAMPAIGN? BUSH AND RUBIO. THEY ARE BOTH NICE GUYS, OK? BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU, NUMBER  ONE, MARCO RUBIO, HE NEVER RAN  BECAUSE BUSH WAS HIS MENTOR.  MARCO WAS NEVER GOING TO RUN AND  THEN HE DID RUN AND THEN THEY  JUST HATED EACH OTHER AND THEN  PEOPLE SAID, NO THEY DON'T, THEY  ARE GOOD FRIENDS.  JEB BUSH STOOD UP AND SAID, ""MARCO IS MY DEAR, DEAR FRIEND"" AND MARCO RUBIO STOOD UP AND SAID ""JEB IS MY DEAR, DEAR FRIEND"" AND I SAID, ""THEY HATE  EACH OTHER."" MY WIFE ACTUALLY SAID, ""WHY DOES  HE KEEP CALLING YOU A GIFTED,  GIFTED POLITICIAN?"" HE KEPT SAYING ""DONALD TRUMP IS  A GIFTED, GIFTED POLITICIAN."" AND I SAID I DO WANT TO TOUCH THAT, NOT ON LIVE TELEVISION, I  DON'T WANT TO TOUCH THAT. BUT LOOK, I UNDERSTOOD WHAT IS GOING ON AND I WILL DO SUCH A  GREAT JOB.  I WILL CUT ARE EXPENSES, WE WILL BECOME RICH, WE WILL BECOME STRONG, WE WILL BECOME GREAT AGAIN, WE WILL BECOME SO GREAT.  WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE. WE DON'T WIN A WAR, WE CAN'T  BEAT ISIS, WE DON'T WIN WITH OUR  GREAT VETERANS, WE CAN'T TAKE  CARE OF THEM, WE DON'T KNOW HOW,  IT IS A CORRUPT SYSTEM, THE  WHOLE V.A. IS CORRUPT. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR  VETERANS.   WE ARE GOING TO WIN  WITH TRADE SO BIG, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE MONEY POURING BACK IN,  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE JOBS  POURING BACK IN OUR COUNTRY, FOLKS, THERE IS NOBODY GOING TO SAY, ""DONALD, PLEASE DON'T DO THAT, PLEASE DON'T DO THAT,"" IF  THEY DO, I WILL SAY, ""THEY DON'T REPRESENT ME."" WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A STRONG BORDER ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE. THE BORDER IS GOING TO BE SO STRONG. YOU KNOW, WE WILL BUILD THE  WALL. WE ARE TO MAKE MEXICO PAY FOR  IT. THEY WILL BUILD IT.   SO YESTERDAY, I HAVE  A GREAT HONOR, BECAUSE I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS, THE BORDER PATROL PEOPLE, 16,500 PEOPLE, A  CALLED UP AND THEY SAID, WE  WOULD LIKE TO ENDORSE MR. TROMP. THEY HAD NEVER ENDORSED A  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BEFORE. -- THEY SAID, ""WE WOULD LIKE TO  ENDORSE MR. TRUMP."" THEY SAID ""WE HAVE NEVER  ENDORSED A PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE BEFORE.""   MR. TRUMP: WE ARE BY FAR THE  STRONGEST ON THE BORDER, AND WHO  IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL?  ""THAT I WILL NEVER DO DRUGS AND, WELL, DO AL LITTLE BIT OF ALCOHOL --  I LOVE KIDS.  YOU WILL NEVER GET HOOKED.  YOU WILL NEVER GET HOOKED.  THAT MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT  THING I HAVE DONE TODAY. SO LOOK, FOLKS, WE ARE GOING TO  HAVE A STRONG BORDER.  WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN. I HOPE ON TUESDAY YOU GO OUT AND VOTE FOR ME. I WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN, I  PROMISE, YOU WILL NOT SEE  ANYTHING LIKE THIS. I PROMISE. SO ON TUESDAY, GO OUT AND VOTE, IT WILL BE THE GREATEST VOTE YOU  HAVE EVER MADE, AND WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN, WE WILL  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, I LOVE YOU, THANK YOU.  THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.","Donald Trump Town Hall Meeting in Rothschild, Wisconsin"

WOW. THANK YOU. I FEEL SO BADLY. OUTSIDE, WE HAVE 5000 PEOPLE AND THEY CANNOT GET IN. I FEEL BADLY. I WANT TO APOLOGIZE. WE HAVE SPEAKERS OUTSIDE. WE HAVE OVER THE 5000 PEOPLE WHO CANNOT GET IN. DOES ANYBODY WANT TO LEAVE AND GIVE YOUR PLACE TO SOMEBODY ELSE?  I HAD A FEELING YOU MIGHT BE SAYING THAT. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. WE ARE DOING VERY WELL. MILLIONS OF VOTES AHEAD OF CRUZ.   I CALLED HIM LYIN' TED CRUZ. I WIN, AS YOU KNOW. I HAVE BEEN WINNING ALL OF THE EVANGELICAL VOTE. HE STANDS UP BIBLE HIGH, PUTS IT DOWN AND THEN HE LIES. IT IS AMAZING TO WATCH HIM. HE SAID, I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN BEAT DONALD TRUMP. I SAID, WAIT A MINUTE, I HAVE WON LIKE MOST OF THE STATES. I THINK HE HAD FIVE OR SIX AND I HAD 20 OR 22, RIGHT? AND, I SAID I CANNOT BELIEVE IT. I HAVE MILLIONS OF VOTES MORE. I HAVE LIKE MILLIONS OF VOTES MORE. I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT. THERE IS SOMETHING HAPPENING, IT IS LIKE A MOVEMENT. IT IS A MOVEMENT AND WE ARE PART OF THE MOVEMENT. IT IS NOT ME. I'M A MESSENGER. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO SPECIAL AND SO AMAZING AND IT IS ON THE COVER OF ""TIME"" MAGAZINE, EVERY NEWSPAPER. IT IS SOMETHING THAT MAYBE HAS NEVER HAPPENED. THEY ARE SAYING IT IS A PHENOMENA. THE MESSAGE IS WHAT WE WANT. WE WANT JOBS, WE WANT JOBS. WE WANT TRADE DEALS THAT ARE SMART, NOT STUPID DEALS. WISCONSIN, WROTE DOWN SOME NOTES -- IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS. I WROTE DOWN SOME NOTES AND IT IS LIKE DEVASTATING. WALKER CAME OUT TODAY. I WROTE DOWN NOTES ABOUT WISCONSIN.   LOOK, HE CERTAINLY CANNOT ENDORSE ME AFTER WHAT I DID TO HIM IN THE RACE. LOOK AT THIS. BY THE SUMMER OF 2015, WISCONSIN WAS FACING A $2.2 BILLION, TWO-YEAR BUDGET DEFICIT. THAT IS TERRIBLE. THESE ARE OUT OF BOOKS. THIS IS NOT TRUMP. TOTAL STATE THAT IS $45 BILLION. MAYBE SOMEBODY WILL TELL ME THAT IS WRONG. $45 BILLION IS VERY HIGH. 20,000 FEWER PEOPLE IN LABOR FORCE IN WISCONSIN THAN SEVEN YEARS AGO EVEN THOUGH POPULATION HAS GROWN BY 100,000. YOUR POPULATION IS HIGHER. WHAT HE ENDORSE CRUZ? HE IS NOT DOING A GREAT JOB. HE COMES INTO HIS WITH HIS MOTORCYCLE JACKET. THE MOTORCYCLE GUYS REALLY LIKE TRUMP.   AND HE DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A MOTORCYCLE GUIDE TO ME. Y TO ME. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE -- THEY SAY THEY CANNOT BE POSSIBLE. ON IMPLEMENTAT 20%, THAT CANNOT BE POSSIBLE. IS IT 20%? EFFECTIVE OR REGULAR? EFFECTIVE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AT 20%. 800,000 FOODSTAMP RECIPIENTS. MIDDLE-CLASS HIT VERY HARD DUE TO LOSS OF MANUFACTURING JOBS. THESE ARE THE FACTS. YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS. IT GOES ON AND ON. WISCONSIN HAS LOST 15,009000 NET JOBS TO MEXICO. KASICH IS RUNNING ALSO. HE VOTED FOR NAFTA. BOTH OF THEM WANT TPP> . TPP, BOTH OF THEM WANT TRANSPACIFIC. THAT WILL MAKE NAFTA LOOK LIKE A BABY AND WISCONSIN WILL BE HIT SO HARD. ARE YOU A MOTORCYCLE GUY? I BET. DO THEY LOVE TRUMP? I DON'T EVEN KNOW. THE MOTORCYCLE GUYS LOVE TRUMP. I LOVE THE DISABLED VETERANS AND THE VETERANS. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS, YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?  WHAT IS IT ABOUT TRUMP THAT THEY LIKE? WE WENT TO HILTON HEAD, DIFFERENT PLACES. THERE WERE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF BIKERS. BEAUTIFUL BIKES. LOTS OF HARLEYS, MADE IN AMERICA. BEAUTIFUL BIKES. WHAT IS IT WITH THEM? WHY DO THEY LIKE ME? TELL ME.   WHO IS THAT? I LOVE IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT THEY LIKE ME. I FEEL GOOD WITH THEM. I TOOK A PICTURE. SECRET SERVICE WENT CRAZY. THESE ARE GOOD PEOPLE. I APPRECIATE IT, FELLAS. WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU THREE. KEEP YOU FREE. WE ARE GETTING RID OF ISIS. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE BORDERS AGAIN. HERE WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS PRETTY INTERESTING. I LOVE YOU, TOO. YOU LOST 70,000 JOBS TO CHINA. 70,000 JOBS. 100,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS LIVING IN WISCONSIN. TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I DON'T KNOW. WHAT HAPPENED WITH WALKER -- I WILL FINISH OFF WITH THIS. HE CAME UP TO MY OFFICE ABOUT A YEAR AGO. I HAD BEEN A POLITICIAN FOR ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS. THE LAST THING IN MY MONITOR ONE IT TOMIND I WANTED TO BE WAS A POLITICIAN. VERY LITTLE DEBT, TREMENDOUS CASH FLOW. I SAY THAT NOT IN A BRAGGING WAY. I SAY THAT BECAUSE THAT IS THE KIND OF THINKING WE NEED. WE CANNOT HAVE CHINA RIPPING US OFF AT MEXICO AND JAPAN AND VIETNAM. WE CANNOT HAVE IT AND THEY ARE RIPPING US LIKE THEY HAVE NEVER RIPPED ANYBODY BEFORE. WE ARE REBUILDING CHINA, MEXICO. THOSE CARRIER AIR-CONDITIONERS MOVING TO MEXICO. FORD MOVING TO MEXICO. NABISCO, HOME OF THE WONDERFUL, FORMERLY WONDERFUL OREO WHICH WE DON'T EAT ANYMORE. WE DON'T NEED ANYMORE. IT IS CALLED ENFORCED DIET. YOU KNOW WHAT? LOOK, WE'RE LOSING OUR JOBS. WHEN I SEE THAT STATISTIC, YOU ARE LOSING YOUR JOBS. WHEN I WENT AFTER YOUR GOVERNOR WHEN HE DECIDED TO RUN AND I SAID I WILL BE NICE TO HIM. HE CAME UP TO MY OFFICE AND HE HANDED ME A PLAQUE BECAUSE I SUPPORTED HIM. I GAVE HIM ABOUT $50,000. THAT IS PRETTY GOOD. I LIKE THE FACT HE WAS ALWAYS FIGHTING. TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMEBODY BEING ABLE TO MAKE A DEAL WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THAT MESS. I GAVE HIM A LOT OF MONEY. HE CAME UP AND GAVE ME A PLAQUE. A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE OF SOMETHING. I NEVER REALLY GOT TO READ IT. I PUT IT ASIDE. IMY GIRL FOUND IT AND SHE SAID SHE JUST FOUND IT. A WONDERFUL WOMAN COMES UP AND I SAID WHERE IS IT? SHE FOUND IT UNDER A PILE OF A LOT OF OTHER PLAQUES. I WILL BRING IT. I WILL TRY TO GET IT BECAUSE I WILL BE HERE THE WHOLE WEEK. I WILL BE IN WISCONSIN THE WHOLE WEEK.  BECAUSE IF WE WIN WISCONSIN, IT IS GOING TO BE PRETTY MUCH OVER BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO DO GREAT. THE EMERSON POLL CAME OUT AND I HAVE ASKED THE 8% IN NEW YORK COMPARED TO ABOUT 10% -- I HAVE ABOUT 78% IN NEW YORK COMPARED TO ABOUT 10%. NEW YORKERS ARE VERY GOOD. CRUZ IS NO GOOD. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO GREAT IN NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY. CHRIS CHRISTIE ENDORSED ME. A GOOD GUY. BEN CARSON ENDORSED ME. SIRRAH PALIN ENDORSEDSARAH PALIN ENDORSED ME. SHERIFF JOE ENDORSED ME. WITH EVANGELICALS, I HAVE HAD SO MANY MINISTERS AND PASTORS ENDORSE ME. JERRY FALWELL ENDORSED ME. WE HAVE DONE WELL WITH EVANGELICALS. CHRISTIANS, EVANGELICALS, WE HAVE DONE SO WELL. WHEN WE WENT TO SOUTH CAROLINA, THAT WAS GOING TO BE CRUZ'S TERRITORY EXCEPT WE WON IN A LANDSLIDE. THIOS GUY FOLLOWS ME AROUND. YOU WERE THERE. HE WAS GOING TO WIN THAT IN THE LANDSLIDE. I STARTED TALKING TO PEOPLE AND I STARTED SAYING THE GOOD AND THE BAD AND THE UGLY. I HAVE WON JUST ABOUT ALMOST EVERY PLACE WITH EVANGELICALS. IT HAS BEEN AN AMAZING TIME. NOW, I'M HERE TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN. I HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE. IT IS AN INCREDIBLE PLACE BUT IT IS A PLACE THAT HAS PROBLEMS. YOU HAVE A GOVERNOR THAT HAS YOU CONVINCED IT DOES NOT HAVE PROBLEMS. I REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, I WAS SO NICE TO HIM. I'M NOT GOING TO HIT HIM. I HIT JEB INSTEAD, RIGHT?  RIGHT? I HIT RAND, OH, RAND. I HIT A LOT OF PEOPLE. WOULDN'T IT BE NICE THAT JUST WITH HIS MOUTH MAKE THINGS HAPPEN THAT ARE POSITIVE? IT'S NOT WITH A MOUTH, IS REALLY WITH THE MOUSE,UTH, THE HEART AND THE BRAIN. I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS THAT ARE GOOD WITH THE MOUTH, BUT NOT WITH THE BRAIN. A POLL CAME OUT, A NATIONWIDE POLL, IT WAS TRUMP 48, I THINK CRUZ WAS SECOND IN THE MID-20'S. KASICH WAS WAY DOWN. WHAT HAPPENED IS THEY SHOWED THE POLL. IT WAS AN NBC POLL. AN NBC MONKEY POLL, AND IT WAS ON THE TODAY SHOW. MORNING JOE HELD IT UP. 48 IS PRETTY GOOD. I HAVE BEEN AT 45% AND I HAVE HAD ABOUT SEVEN PEOPLE. HOW DO YOU GET 45% WHEN YOU HAVE SEVEN? HOW DO YOU CRACK 50%? THE POLL WAS GOOD. WAY AHEAD OF ANYBODY ELSE. THEY SHOWED HILLARY CLINTON. GOT A BIGGER PROBLEM WITH E-MAILS THEN I THINK WITH BERNIE, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. THE BIGGER PROBLEM SHOULD BE THAT. WE WILL FIND OUT HOW HONEST OUR COUNTRY IS. SHE'S GOT -- THEY PUT HERE POLL UP. THEN, THEY SAID AND THEN DONALD TRUMP IS WINNING. THAT IS IT. THEY DID NOT PUT NUMBERS UP. THEY DIDN'T SAY I'M DOING GREAT. THEY SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP IS WINNING AND THEY PUT A SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE STATISTIC. WAIT A MINUTE. THEY PUT HER NUMBERS UP AND DIDN'T PUT MINE UP. IT IS SO UNFAIR. THE PRESS IS SO DISHONEST IT IS UNBELIEVABLE.  THAT WAS CHUCK TODD THIS MORNING ON THE TODAY SHOW. THEY PUT HILLARY'S NUMBERS UP AND HIM WINNING BY A LOT. I GUARANTEE YOU ONE THING, IF I WAS DOING POORLY, IT WOULD BE UP ALL MORNING BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING. I'M SELF FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN. I'M PUTTING UP MY OWN MONEY.  TED CRUZ AND JOHN KASICH ARE GETTING MONEY FROM THE BANK INDUSTRY, AND ENERGY INDUSTRIES, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. YOU CANNOT STRAIGHTEN OUT THIS MESS. WE ARE IN A MESS. IF YOU CANNOT DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. WHEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE GIVEN TO CRUZ AND KASICH, AND MILLIONS FROM DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES, YOU WERE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO GO AGAINST THE BANK INDUSTRY TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE IF THE BANK INDUSTRY GIVE YOU MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THAT IS TRUE WITH HILLARY. I'M THE ONLY ONE SELF FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN. WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL IS WHEN I WAS RUNNING AGAINST JEB IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I WAS IN FOR $2 MILLION AND JEB WAS IN FOR $48 MILLION. I WAS FIRST AND HE WAS CLOSE TO LAST. BY THE WAY, DID JEB ENDORSE ANYBODY GET? DDID HE ENDORSE? THAT SHOWS YOU HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. I DON'T EVEN KNOW. HE'LL ENDORSE --- WHEN YOU ARE IN WAR, YOU HAVE TO FIGHT HARD. WHEN I FIGHT, I WIN. YOU ARE GOING TO WIN. YOU KNOW THAT. BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU DO PRETTY SERIOUS DAMAGE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO WIN FAST. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LOVE YOU AFTER YOU FINISH. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM.  IN FACT, THEY ARE ASKING CRUZ -- I HAVE WON EVERY SINGLE DEBATE. I HAVE DEBATED HIM 11 OR 12 TIMES. EVERY SINGLE ONLINE POLL HAS ME WINNING THE DEBATE. HE IS AN OK DEBATOR, BUT HE IS A BAD TALKER. HE WAITS. EVER SEE, EGO SENTENCE AFTER SENTENCE AND STOPS FOR ABOUT THREE OR FOUR SECONDS AND GOES AGAIN. IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE IN THE THEATER. THIS IS THE REAL WORLD. WHAT HAPPENS -- THANK YOU.   THAT IS ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE SHERIFF IS HERE. HE IS A GREAT GUY AND HIS PEOPLE ARE FANTASTIC. THANK YOU, SHERIFF.  THE ONLY THING I FEEL GUILTY ABOUT HIS THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE. WE ARE GOING TO COME BACK TO THIS AREA. YOU GUYS CANNOT COME, OK? ALL OF THE LADIES CAN COME, BUT THE GUYS CANNOT. BUT, BUT, ALL OF THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE, WE ARE GOING TO GET SOME. I FEEL SLIGHTLY GUILTY. LOOK, WE HAVE A VERY SERIOUS MESS ON OUR HANDS. WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOT PROTECTED. A COUNTRY THAT IS SITTING ON A BIG FAT BUBBLE THAT WILL EXPLODE. DON'T DO IT AFTER I GET IN. THREE DAYS LATER, IT WILL EXPLODE AND IT WILL BE TRUMP'S FAULT. WE ARE IN A BIG FAT, UGLY BUBBLE. WE HAVE INTEREST RATES THAT ARE SO LOW THAT IF YOU ARE RICH -- LIKE ME, I CAN BORROW MONEY FOR ANY AMOUNT. IF YOU ARE HARD-WORKING GUY WITH A GREAT FARM OR HARD-WORKING DEVELOPER OR BUSINESSMAN, YOU CANNOT BORROW MONEY. THINK OF HOW BAD THAT IS. YOU CAN BORROW MONEY FOR NOTHING PRACTICALLY IF YOU ARE RICH. BUT IF YOU ARE RICH, YOU DON'T NEED THE MONEY. IF YOU ARE A BUSINESS PERSON AND WANT TO GET A LOAN, YOU CANNOT GET IT. THE REGULATORS ARE RUNNING THE BANK. DODD-FRANK HAS BEEN A DISASTER.  THE BIGGEST DISASTER ARE, OUR RULES AND REGULATIONS ARE HORRIBLE. WE WILL PROBABLY GET RID OF 85% OF THEM. SO MANY PEOPLE FROM THIS AREA HAVE TOLD ME REGULATIONS, REGULATORY CLIMATE IS THE WORST THEY HAVE EVER SEEN IT. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO WAS A FARMEIS A FARMER. IT IS LIKE A PUDDLE AND THEY CONSIDER IT A LAKE. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SO GREAT AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SO STRONG AGAIN. OUR MILITARY IS GOING TO BE SO AMAZING. WE WILL NEVER HAVE TO USE IT. I NEVER WANTED TO GO INTO IRAQ. ALL OF THESE GUYS THINK I'M A TOUGH GUY SO I WILL BE QUICK WITH THE TRIGGER. I DIDN'T WANT THE TRIGGER. WHEN OBAMA LEFT, HE SHOULD NOT HAVE LEFT THE WAY HE DID. HE GAVE A CERTAIN DATE AND THE ENEMY SAID IT CANNOT BE POSSIBLE. NOBODY CAN BE THAT STUPID. I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK IT HURT THAT MUCH THAT THE ENEMY WHEN NOT BELIEVE ANYBODY WOULD BE STUPID ENOUGH TO GIVE A DATE. THEY PULLED BACK AND THEN YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED. THEY WENT IN WITH FURY. HOW ABOUT THE 50 SOLDIERS HE SEN T A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO? HE SENT 50 OF OUR FINEST. INSTEAD OF SENDING THEM QUIETLY, WHAT DOES HE DO? HE SENDS THEM IN, MAKES A BIG PRESS CONFERENCE THAT WE ARE SENDING 50 SOLDIERS INTO IRAQ, SYRIA. NOW, THESE SOLDIERS HAVE A BIG TARGET ON THEIR BACK. WHY CAN'T WE JUST KEEP OUR MOUTH SHUT? WHY CAN'T WE BE UNPREDICTABLE?  WHY CAN'T WE BE UNPREDICTABLE? FIRST OF ALL, IT DOES NOT EVEN SOUND GOOD WHEN YOU SAY 50 SOLDIERS. IS THAT GOOD OR BAD? BUT THEN, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WHY DO WE HAVE TO SAY THAT? THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE. THESE ARE OUR FINEST AND IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS MISSION. WHY WOULD YOU TELL PEOPLE THAT WE ARE SENDING THEM IN? YOU KEEP QUIET AND LET THEM ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING. WHO KNOWS WHAT HAS HAPPENED, BUT RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE A BIG TARGET ON THEIR BACK. PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE LET GO AT GITMO HAVE NOW KILLED AMERICANS. THAT CAME OUT YESTERDAY. IS ANYBODY SURPRISED? WOULD ANYBODY BE SURPRISED? WE ARE KEEPING IT OPEN. THEY ARE SENDING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS TO RUN IT. I GUARANTEE YOU CAN RUN IT A LOT CHEAPER AND YOU WOULD HAVE A LOT OF MONEY LEFT OVER. WE WILL GET EFFICIENCY IN GOVERNMENT. WE WILL END OBAMACARE. WE WILL REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING SO MUCH BETTER AND SO MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE. WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF COMMON CORE. WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR EDUCATION LOCAL.  WE ARE GOING TO PRESERVE OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. IT IS UNDER SIEGE. IT IS TOTALLY UNDER SIEGE. CHRISTIANITY IS UNDER SIEGE. YOU TAKE A LOOK. I HAVE BEEN WITH SO MANY PASTORS LATELY. JERRY FALWELL, JR. WAS TELLING ME THAT I REMINDED HIM OF HIS FATHER. WHAT HIS FATHER DID WITH LIBERTY UNIVERSITY. JERRY, TO TOP IT OFF, HAS TAKEN THAT TO A NEW PLACE. I WAS TALKING -- PROBABLY HAD 50 OF THE MINISTERS AND PASTORS COMING TO MY OFFICE. THEY ARE REALLY UNDER TREMENDOUS PRESSURE BECAUSE OF THAT WANT TO HAVE THEIR -- THEY DON'TY WANT THEIR TAX-EXEMPT STATUS TAKEN UNDER WAY. I SAID WHY IS IT THAT YOU FOLKS ARE THAT WAY? WHY DO YOU ALLOW THEM? WHY AREN'T YOU MORE FORCEFUL? FINALLY, SOMEBODY SAID WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH OUR TAX-EXEMPT STATUS. WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO GET RID OF THAT. THAT IS REALLY TERRIBLE. WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO -- I HAVE SAID THAT TO A LOT OF EVANGELICALS, A LOT OF GREAT CHRISTIANS. IT HAS -- IT'S SORT OF MEANS THAT SOMEBODY WALKING DOWN THE STREET HAS MORE POWER THAN SOMEBODY OF OUR RELIGION, CHRISTIANITY, SOMEBODY THAT IS AN EVANGELICAL. THEY HAVE MORE POWER. THEY HAVE TAKEN THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH AWAY. I SAID WE WOULD TRY TO GET RID OF THAT AND I THINK WE WILL BE VERY SUCCESSFUL. HOW MANY CHRISTIANS ARE THERE? WE HAVE MEN AND WOMEN. CUT IT IN HALF AND WE HAVE A FEW MORE WOMEN, BUT WE HAVE FAR MORE CHRISTIANS THAN MEN AND WOMEN. IT IS THE BIGGEST GROUP OF PEOPLE. WE ARE NOT ALLOWED, THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK BECAUSE THEY ARE PETRIFIED. YOU SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH THE IRS. WE ARE GOING TO TRY -- USUALLY WHEN I SAY TRY, THAT MEANS I WILL GET IT DONE.  WE ARE GOING TO TRY VERY HARD AND GET THAT BROUGHT BACK. I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO COUNTER IT BECAUSE IF THE WHOLE EVANGELICAL, CHRISTIAN SECTOR GETS TOGETHER, NOBODY CAN BEAT THEM. WHEN I MADE THE STATEMENT ABOUT MUSLIMS, HAVING THEM IN A TEMPORARY BASIS, I TOOK SO MUCH HEAT. NOW PEOPLE ARE SAYING TRUMP IS SORT OF RIGHT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED.  TWELVE  AND I THINK ABOUT WHAT   IF I'D SAID IT ABOUT CHRISTIANS, THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY. WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN.  WE'RE GOING TO TURN THIS   COUNTRY AROUND AND WE'RE GOING   TO BE THE SMART PEOPLE.  WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE THE  DUMMIES ANYMORE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE WHERE  CHINA MADE LAST YEAR TRADE DEFICIT $505 BILLION, WITH A B, BILLION. JAPAN, OVER $100 BILLION. MEXICO, $58 BILLION. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A WALL,   AND MEXICO'S GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL. OK?   I REMEMBER RECENTLY I WAS IN   FLORIDA AND MARCO, WHO IS A  NICE GUY, ACTUALLY.  YOU NOTICE HOW NICE THEY ARE   AFTER YOU'VE DEFEATED THEM?  I LIKE HERB I -- EVERYBODY I   DEFEAT.  BUT WHEN I WENT AGAINST MARCO,   IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A VERY -- AH, BOY. WELL, HE STARTED IT, RIGHT?  JUST LIKE CRUZ STARTED THE LAST DEAL. HE STARTED IT. BUT MARCO CAME AFTER ME VERY   VICIOUSLY. HE WANTED TO BE DON RICKLES,   RIGHT? AND IT DIDN'T WORK. BUT WHAT HAPPENED IS, WHAT   HAPPENED IS I WON BY 20 POINTS.  ALMOST 20 POINTS.   AND A LOT OF THESE ISSUES WE   WERE TALKING ABOUT, BIG ISSUES.  FRANKLY I WISH I WOULD HAVE  LEFT ABOUT TWO DAYS EARLIER. I WANTED TO STAY IN FLORIDA AND CAMPAIGN.  I WISH I HAD DEVOTED TWO MORE DAYS TO OHIO BECAUSE I ALMOST WON IN OHIO. I WOULD HAVE WON OHIO BUT I  DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE ON  LEAVING MY BEAUTIFUL FLORIDA   ALONE. BECAUSE I LOVE FLORIDA.  I WANTED TO WIN THAT.  SO IF I WOULD HAVE LEFT A COUPLE DAYS EARLIER, I THINK I   WOULD HAVE WON FLORIDA PROBABLY.  BUT I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE  ANYTHING HAPPEN IN WISCONSIN.  WE HAVE TO WIN. IF WE --    LOOK, WE HAVE TO PUT THESE POLITICIANS IN THEIR PLACE, FOLKS. IT'S TIME. BELIEVE ME, YOU KNOW, CRUZ LIKES TO PRETEND HE'S AN OUTSIDER.  IN THE MEANTIME HE GETS ALL THE ESTABLISHMENT SUPPORT. INCLUDING YOUR GOVERNOR. BELIEVE ME, BELIEVE ME, THEY'RE ALL ESTABLISHMENT. FRANKLY IN A WAY IT'S WORSE. BECAUSE CRUZ IS ESTABLISHMENT  AND YET HE'S GOT NO RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT. HE GOES AND HE STANDS ON THE   FLOOR OF THE SENATE FOR A DAY  AND A HALF AND HE FILIBUSTERS  AND THESE SENATORS, LOOK, I  KNOW, THEY'RE TOUGH COOKIES. I HAVE ONE OF THE GREAT PEOPLE,  SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS.  NOBODY BETTER THAN JEFF. AND CRUZ THOUGHT HE WAS GOING  TO HAVE HIM. USED HIM IN HIS SPEECH. THEN HE COMES OUT AND ENDORSES   ME.  BUT WHEN YOU THINK OF IT, LOOK, OUT OF ALL OF THESE SENATORS,  HE HAS ONE SUPPORTER, WHO IS HIS FRIEND.  HIS FRIEND.  BY THE WAY, TOOK HIM PLENTY OF   TIME TO DO IT. BUT TO STAND THERE AND TO RANT   AND RAVE FOR TWO DAYS AND TO   SHOW PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN   FILIBUSTER, IN THE MEANTIME,   NOTHING WAS ACCOMPLISHED. CRUZ HAS NOT ACCOMPLISHED ONE THING. SO HE'S AN INSIDER BUT IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE MAN ON THE   STREET, BECAUSE HE CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE. HE DISEASE LIKES PEOPLE, HE  CALLS PEOPLE, LIKE, FOR  INSTANCE, HE SAID HORRIBLE   THINGS ABOUT THE SPEAKER.  AND, YOU KNOW, HE SAID, ABOUT  THE SPEAKER? AND HE SAID ABOUT, SEPARATELY, MITCH MCCONNELL. HE SAID SOME TERRIBLE THINGS   ABOUT, HOW DO YOU GET THINGS   DONE WHEN YOU'RE CALLING MITCH   MCCONNELL BAD NAMES? OK, LET'S JUST SAY BAD NAMES.  SO HE'S SORT OF GOT THE WORST OF ALL ELEMENTS. HE'S AN INSIDER TOTALLY. BUT HE CAN GET NOTHING DONE. HE CAN GET NOTHING DONE. YOUR NEW SPEAKER, HOW DO YOU   LIKE PAUL RYAN?  HOW DO YOU LIKE HIM? YOU LIKE HIM?   WOW. I WAS TOLD BE NICE TO PAUL RYAN.  BECAUSE -- REALLY? ALL RIGHT. WELL, HE'S THE SPEAKER. HE'S A NICE GUY. HE CALLED ME THE OTHER DAY, HE   WAS VERY NICE. BUT I'M VERY SURPRISED AT THIS   STATEMENT. WOW. ARE YOU ALL REPUBLICANS? ARE YOU MOSTLY CONSERVATIVES?   BECAUSE I DON'T CARE.  THE WORD -- I ALWAYS SAY I'M A   COMMONPLACE, YOU KNOW, JUST A COMMONSENSE CONSERVATIVE.  SO IMPORTANT. A COMMONSENSE -- AND THEN SOMEBODY TOLD ME TODAY THAT  SOMEBODY ELSE, I THINK WALKER USED MY TERM. WALKER USED -- I SAID, MAKE  AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I SAID, MAKE AMERICA GREAT   AGAIN. AND I COPYWRITED -- COPYRIGHTED  THE TERM.  THEN WALKER WAS MAKING A SPEECH MANY MONTHS AGO AND HE SAID,   MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  BECAUSE HE SAW THE RESPONSE I  GOT. THE DIFFERENCE IS HE DIDN'T GET ANY RESPONSE.  TO IT DIDN'T HELP. WE TOLD HIM, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. NOW I SAID, A COMMONSENSE CONSERVATIVE AND TODAY I HEARD HE USED THE TERM BECAUSE THE   PRESS WAS UP AND THEY INTERVIEWED ME AND THEY SAID   HE'S A COMMONSENSE CONSERVATIVE.  I COINED THE PHRASE A FEW  MONTHS AGO. BUT THAT'S WHAT I AM. I'M A CONSERVATIVE PERSON. I'M VERY, VERY CONSERVATIVE ON   THE MILITARY.  I'M VERY CONSERVATIVE WITH   OTHER VETS AND ON HEALTH CARE AND ON LOTS OF THINGS. BUT -- AND I'M ACTUALLY VERY   CONSERVATIVE ON TRADE. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD SAY,   HE'S NOT THAT CONSERVATIVE ON  TRADE BECAUSE HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN FREE TRADE. ACTUALLY, I DO BELIEVE IN FREE TRADE. BUT IT'S GOT TO BE GOOD TRADE  FOR US, RIGHT? THE GOT TO BE SMART TRADE. IT CAN'T BE WHERE WISCONSIN'S  LOSING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF JOBS, WHERE YOU FOLKS CAN'T GET INTO CHINA BUT CHINA COMES IN HERE LIKE IT'S SWISS CHEESE,  THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. CHINA DOES NOT OBEY THE RULES. NOW, I GET ALONG GREAT WITH  CHINA. I MADE A FORTUNE DEALING WITH CHINA. I HAVE TWO BUILDINGS BECAUSE OF  CHINA. BIG ONES IN NEW YORK AND ONE IN  SAN FRANCISCO. BANK OF AMERICA. THAT I HAVE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH  A GREAT COMPANY. AND IT'S BECAUSE OF CHINA. I SELL -- I HAVE THE BIGGEST --  ONE OF THE BIG LEASES WITH ONE OF THEIR BIG BANKS, WITH THE   BIGGEST BANK IN THE WORLD ACTUALLY, FROM CHINA.  MILLIONS OF AND MILLIONS OF  CONLEDSOWS TO PEOPLE FROM  CHINA. I LIKE CHINA.  I'M NOT ANGRY AT CHINA.  I LIKE THEM. I THINK THEY'RE LEADERS ARE DOING A GREAT JOB FOR THEM.  BUT OUR LEADERS ARE DOING A BAD  JOB FOR US.  SAME WITH MEXICO. I GET ALONG GREAT. THE HISPANICS, I LOVE THE  HISPANICS. I LOVE THE HISPANICS.  BUT THEIR LEADERS ARE KILLING  US ON THE BORDER AND TRADE.  I'M NOT ANGRY AT THEM. I'M ANGRY AT OUR COUNTRY AND   OUR LEADERSHIP BECAUSE IT'S GROSSLY INCOMPETENT AND WE'RE  GOING TO CHANGE IT AROUND. AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THE BEST  AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THE   FINEST.   SO, WHAT I THOUGHT -- THANK  YOU, FOLKS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE IT. SO, WHATEVER YOU CAN COULD TO SPREAD THE WORD, I'LL BE   AROUND, I'M GOING TO GREEN BAY,  I LOVE THAT TEAM BY THE WAY. TALK ABOUT A GREAT FRANCHISE. I LOVE IT. AND YOU HAVE A TRULY GREAT QUARTERBACK. I DON'T KNOW, HE'S PROBABLY  ENDORSING SOMEBODY ELSE. BUT I DON'T CARE.  HE'S STILL A GREAT QUARTERBACK. TOM BRADY'S A FRIEND OF MINE.  HE SAID YOU HAVE A GREAT   QUARTERBACK. THAT'S ALL I NEED, RIGHT? WHEN TOM SAYS HE'S A GREAT   QUARTERBACK, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.  BUT I REALLY WANT TO WIN WISCONSIN. BECAUSE IF WE CAN WIN  WISCONSIN, WE'RE GOING TO PUT  ALL THE STUPIDITY AWAY.  WE'RE GOING TO PUT THESE STUPID, STUPID PEOPLE THAT   ALLOW -- AND I'M TALKING ABOUT BASICALLY POLITICIANS. IN MANY CASES, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE WILL SEE DEALS   THAT ARE DONE AND, I MEAN, TAKE  A LOOK AT THE IRAN DEAL. HOW BAD IS THAT? JUST AS A DEAL.  FORGET ABOUT COUNTRIES. BUT MANY TIMES PEOPLE SAY DEALS  THAT THE COUNTRY MAKES, RIGHT,   DEALS, AND THEY'LL SAY, HOW CAN OUR POLITICIANS BE SO STUPID?  THEY'RE NOT STUPID.  THEY'VE BEEN HIT BY THE LOBBYISTS AND THE SPECIAL  INTERESTS AND THEY MAKE A FORTUNE. THEY GET TREMENDOUS CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. THEY'RE NOT STUPID.  THEY'RE DOING IT FOR THEMSELVES.  AGAIN, I'M NOT DOING THAT. I'M DOING IT FOR YOU, I'M WORKING FOR YOU. REMEMBER, THEY'RE NOT SO STUPID  LIKE YOU THINK.   BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PEOPLE  FUNDING CRUZ'S CAMPAIGN, AND   KASICH'S CAMPAIGN, AND YOU LOOK, DON'T FORGET, CRUZ SAID,   OH, THE BANKS, THE BANKS, HE'S GOING TO BE ROBIN HOOD, HE'S   GOING TO BE THIS GREAT GUY. AND THEN IN HIS PERSONAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORM, HE  FORGOT TO MENTION THAT HE BORROWED ABOUT $1 MILLION FROM   THE BANKS, CITIBANK AND GOLDMAN SACHS, HE BORROWED $1 MILLION AT AN INTEREST RATE THAT   EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM WOULD BE PROUD TO HAVE. A VERY LOW INTEREST RATE.  ALMOST NO INTEREST. HE FORGOT TO ANNOUNCE IT ON HIS PERSONAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORM.  HE JUST FORGOT. HE SAID, OH, I FORGOT. I FORGOT.  SO THEN HE HITS THE BANKS. HE'S CONTROLLED BY THESE PEOPLE, FOLKS. WHAT HE DID WAS ABSOLUTELY   WRONG. BUT THEY'RE CONTROLLED BY THESE PEOPLE.  I'M CONTROLLED BY YOU. I'M GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR YOU.  OK? SO REMEMBER THAT.  SO LET'S TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS. THEN I'M OFF TO GREEN BAY. I LOVE THAT. OK.  LET'S GO. GO AHEAD.  MY BIKER FRIENDS.  WE HAVE TO START WITH THEM.  22 VETERANS A DAY COMMIT SUICIDE, THAT'S CORRECT.  WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS SO MUCH.  MANY END UP KILLING THEMSELVES WAITING TO SEE A DOCTOR. 22 A DAY.  A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE  THAT NUMBER. THEY THINK THE ALMOST LIKE AN IMPOSSIBLE NUMBER. HOW COULD IT BE SO BAD? THE ACTUALLY -- IT COULD BE  WORSE THAN THAT. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF  THEM FROM THE STANDPOINT, THEY   WAIT, THEY WAIT, THEN THEY GET   BAD SERVICE. AND THEY WAIT SOME MORE. SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT DAYS. SOMETIMES THEY'LL GET TO SEE THE DOCTOR AND THE DOCTOR SAYS, I CAN'T SEE YOU NOW, I'M GOING   ON VACATION. YOU SEE THE CORRUPTNESS. I JUST LEFT PHOENIX. WE HAD 21,000 PEOPLE, SHERIFF JOE WAS THERE, THE JOB HE DID  WAS INCREDIBLE. INCREDIBLE.  THEY HAD A LITTLE PROTEST, RIGHT? THAT PROTEST ENDED SO -- HE ARRESTED THREE PEOPLE. EVERYONE ELSE SCATTERED. AND YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF A  SHERIFF HERE.  YOU HAVE A TOUGH COOKIE HERE.  I CAN TELL YOU.  I JUST MET HIM AND I CAN TELL YOU. BUT WE'RE GOING TO -- YOU KNOW,  I HAVE A GREAT POLICY PLAN AND   I'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF CREDIT FOR IT, IT'S ON DONALDJTRUMP.COM.  WITH THE VETERANS, WHEN THEY'RE  WAITING FOR EXORBITANT TIMES, EVEN FOR A LITTLE TIME, THEY'RE  GOING TO GO TO THE DOCTOR,   THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO LOCAL DOCTORS OR LOCAL HOSPITALS,  MANY OF THE HOSPITALS ARE DYING FOR BUSINESS, YOU KNOW THAT, THEY'RE DYING, THESE HOSPITALS,  SOME OF THESE HOMS -- HOSPITALS  ARE DYING. THEY'RE GOING TO GET IMMEDIATE   TREATMENT, IMMEDIATE SERVICE,  WE'RE GOING TO PATE BILL. AND WE'RE GOING TO SAVE A  FORTUNE AND THEY'RE GOING TO GET GREAT S. EVERYBODY IS IN LOVE WITH IT -- GREAT. AND EVERYBODY IS IN LOVE WITH  IT. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR  VETERANS.  IF WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF OUR   VETERANS, WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF  ANYONE.  SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS.  GO AHEAD.  ONE MORE FROM MY OTHER BIKER FRIEND HERE.  BOY, DO YOU LOOK GOOD, THOUGH.  YOU LOOK GOOD AND TOUGH. I WOULDN'T WANT TO FIGHT YOU.  DO YOU THINK I COULD TAKE NEW A  FIGHT? I DON'T THINK SO.  WHAT DO YOU THINK? HOW ABOUT WE DO IT RIGHT NOW? THAT WOULD BE GREAT FOR  TELEVISION. GO AHEAD.  BUT I DO HAVE MORE HAIR THAN   HIM. RIGHT? GO AHEAD.  I KNOW, IT'S TERRIBLE. WHY ARE YOU UNEMPLOYABLE?  OK. I GOT IT.  I KNOW THAT. DAYCARE IS A PROBLEM.  I KNOW. I'VE HEARD THIS MANY TIMES.  HERE'S THE PROBLEM. OUR VETERANS ARE TAKING WORSE  -- TAKEN WORSE CARE OF THAN  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO COME  INTO THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.  YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WRITE IT  DOWN.  WE'RE GOING TO DO THINGS ABOUT IT.  YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,   I'VE HEARD THIS SO MANY TIMES BEFORE WITH THE DAYCARE AND  EVERYTHING ELSE. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS.  BY THE WAY, SPEAKING OF INCREASE, CRUZ AND KASICH WANT TO DESTROY SOCIAL SECURITY, FOLKS. I WANT TO BRING MONEY BACK INTO  THIS COUNTRY. I WANT TO BRING JOBS INTO THIS   COUNTRY. I WANT TO BRING TREMENDOUS   WEALTH INTO THIS COUNTRY.  I WANT TO TAKE OUR WEALTH BACK FROM CHINA, FROM MEXICO, FROM  ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE OUR WEALTH. WE'RE GOING TO SAVE YOU SOCIAL   SECURITY AND WE'RE DIAGNOSE TO SAVE YOU MEDICARE. THEY WANT TO GET RID OF IT.  REMEMBER THAT.  YOU COULD DO. I WANT TO NOT USE TOO MANY EXECUTIVE ORDERS, FOLKS. EXECUTIVE ORDERS SORT OF CAME  ABOUT MORE RECENTLY. NOBODY EVER HEARD OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN OBAMA, BECAUSE HE COULDN'T GET ANYBODY TO AGREE WITH HIM, HE STARTS SIGNING THEM LIKE THEY'RE BUTTER. SO I WANT TO DO AWAY WITH EXECUTIVE ORDERS FOR THE MOST PART. BUT LOOK.  JUST DO ME A FAVOR.  STICK WITH ME. YOU'RE GOING TO BE OK. ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT? OK?  YOU'RE GOING TO BE OK. I KNOW. WHAT YOU'VE SAID I'VE HEARD A HUNDRED TIMES. AND THE DAYCARE'S A HUGE   PROBLEM. A HUGE PROBLEM. YOUR WIFE NOT WORKING, HUGE PROK.  -- PROBLEM. SHE CAN'T. I BET YOU HAVE A GREAT WIFE. GOOD WIFE? BETTER BELIEVE IT. GO AHEAD.  WE'RE DOING IT. WE'RE ENDING COMMON CORE. YOUR KIDS IN WISCONSIN ARE NO  LONGER GOING TO BE EDUCATED IN   WASHINGTON, D.C., BY BUREAUCRATS. MANY OF WHOM, I CAN'T SAY ALL, BUT MANY OF WHOM DON'T CARE FOR  YOUR KIDS. THEY COULDN'T CARE LESS. THEY GET BIG FAT SALARIES. YOUR KIDS ARE GOING TO BE EDUCATED LOCALLY. WE'RE TERMINATING COMMON CORE. WILL YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT'S  MAGIC. AND I'VE SEEN IT. WHERE PARENTS AND ALL OF THESE PEOPLE, THEY'RE ALL DISTRIBUTE   UNCLE, THE AUNTS, THEY'RE ALL  ON SCHOOL BOARDS, THEY GET PROFESSIONALS, THEY HAVE GREAT   PRINCIPALS. YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT'S GOING ON  FROM WASHINGTON, D.C.  MANY OF THE PEOPLE NEVER EVEN  COME HERE. THEY SIT BEHIND A DESK IN WASHINGTON, THEY DRAW BIG SAL  ARE RI AND THEY'RE TELL -- SALARIES AND THEY'RE TELLING YOU HOW TO EDUCATE YOUR KIDS.  I'VE SEEN SEEN IT WHERE THE KID  GRADUATES AND THOSE PARENTS  STAY ON. THEY LOVE IT, BECAUSE THEIR CHILD WENT THROUGH THE SYSTEM. THEY LOVE IT.  AND THEY BECOME SO GOOD AT IT. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. WE'RE ONE OF THE WORST IN THE  WORLD IN EDUCATION. WE'RE GOING TO BE ONE OF THE BETTER ONES. NOT NECESSARILY, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE SWEDEN, NORWAY, DENMARK AND CHINA. BUT WE'RE GOING TO COME VERY CLOSE.  DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL  .   I DON'T THINK THAT WISCONSIN SHOULD HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WITH   DISCIPLINE.  DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH DISCIPLINE? YOU'RE FROM WHERE?  OH, WELL THAT'S INTERESTING, OK. WE HAVE TO GET DISCIPLINE BACK   IN THE COUNTRY. FORGOT ABOUT SCHOOL.  I MEAN, I HAVE A CASE, I HAVE A WONDERFUL GUY, CAMPAIGN MANAGER, YOU TALK ABOUT  DISCIPLINE. AND YOU PROBABLY SAW WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.  WITH MY CAMPAIGN -- HE'S A GOOD  GUY. COREY. BY THE WAY, THE EASIEST THING,   COREY, YOU'RE FIRED. I CAN'T DO THAT. CAN'T DO IT. SO FORTUNATELY I HAVE A TAPING   SYSTEM. I'M RICH.  SO I HAVE THIS WOMAN WHO   COMPLAINED, SHE WAS TALKING  ABOUT MAYBE BEING THROWN TO THE  FLOOR. ALL THIS.  THEN WE SAW THE TAPES. DID ANYBODY SEE THE TAPE?  WHAT DID YOU THINK? RIGHT? NOTHING. WOMEN -- WHAT DID YOU THINK?  HER FACE STAYED THE   SAME. IF SOMEBODY SQUEEZED YOUR ARM  OR DID SOMETHING REALLY BAD, DON'T FORGET, INITIALLY SHE  SAID, THROWN TO THE FLOOR. BUT IF SOMEBODY SQUEEZED YOUR  ARM OR HURT YOU, WOULDN'T YOU START SCREAMING OR SOMETHING?  DID YOU SEE ANY CHANGE IN HER FACE?  IT'S HORRIBLE. IT'S HORRIBLE. HONESTLY, IT'S HORRIBLE. AND THE BEST THING I COULD DO IS -- BUT I CAN'T DESTROY A MAN. I'D DESTROY HIM. HE HAS A BEAUTIFUL WIFE AND CHILDREN.  I'M NOT GOING TO DESTROY MAN FOR THAT. WHEN I SAW THAT AT THE TAPE, AT  FIRST I SAID, THIS IS TERRIBLE.  THEN I SAW THE TAPE. IT'S MY TAPE. I'M THE ONE THAT HAS A TAPE. IT'S ON THE CEILING OF THIS INCREDIBLE CLUB IN JUPITER,  FLORIDA. AND WE'RE ALL LEAVING. AND WE HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE. RIGHT? AND THE PRESS CONFERENCE LASTED A LONG TIME. 45 MINUTES, SO THAT WAS ENOUGH. I'M LEAVING WITH A WHOLE BIG   GANG OF PEOPLE.  PEOPLE PUSHING LEFT AND RIGHT. LEFT AND RIGHT.  AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE BOLTS  INTO THE PICTURE.  SHE GRABS ME OR HITS ME ON THE   ARM. IN FACT, I'M LIKE THIS WITH MY   ARM UP.  AND THEN HE GOES BY AND, I   MEAN, MAYBE HE TOUCHED HER A   LITTLE BIT.  BUT IT WAS ALMOST LIKE HE WAS  TRYING TO KEEP HER OFF ME, RIGHT?  LIKE HE WAS HELPING HER. DID YOU SEE HER FALL TO THE GROUND?  BECAUSE SHE TALKED ABOUT FALLING. NOW, AFTER -- I MUST TELL YOU, HER STATEMENT CHANGED BIG  LEAGUE.  BECAUSE SHE SAID, GO TO THE  GROUND, YOU KNOW, ALL THIS.  I COULD READ IT TO YOU.  DOES ANYBODY WANT TO HEAR IT?  I WANT TO BE ACCURATE. BECAUSE I LIKE THE PRESS TO TREAT ME.  SO BEFORE SHE KNEW SHE WAS ON  TAPE, SHE SAID, I WAS JOLTED   BACKWARDS. WAS SHE JOLTED BACKWARDS? I MEAN, IF SHE WAS, HER FACE STAYED THE SAME. I WAS JOLTED BACKWARDS. SOMEONE GRABBED ME TIGHTLY BY  THE ARM. AND YANKED ME DOWN.  CAMPAIGN MANAGERS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO FORCEFULLY THROW   REPORTERS TO THE GROUND. EXCEPT SHE NEVER WENT TO THE   GROUND. SHE NEVER EVEN CAME -- SHE NEVER EVEN FLINCHED. IF SOMEBODY GRABS YOU, EVEN ONE  OF THE GUYS, EVEN THE BININGERS, IF SOMEBODY GRABS EVEN A BIKER, OR PUNCHES YOU A   LITTLE BIT, YOU'RE OFF, RIGHT? THE TOUGHEST GUY, THE TOUGHEST WOMAN, LOOK AT HER FACE. IT'S ZERO. THEY'RE GOING TO DESTROY A MAN'S LIFE?  AND THEN I HAVE CRUZ SAYING, OH, THAT WAS A TERRIBLE THING. THAT WAS A TERRIBLE THING. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, FOLKS. IF I WIN, IF I LOSE, I DIDN'T  NEED TO DO THIS. I'M DOING THIS BECAUSE I JUST HAD A BEAUTIFUL GRANDCHILD.   IVANKA AND JERROD, BEAUTIFUL,  BEAUTIFUL GRANDCHILD.  I'M VERY PROUD.  MY EIGHTH. I'M DOING THIS ALL FOR THEM. I DIDN'T NEED TO DO THIS. THIS IS NOT -- I HAD NO IDEA, YOU KNOW, MAYBE NONE OF US DID.  I HAD NO IDEA THE MESSAGE WAS  GOING TO GET ACROSS. IT'S A MESSAGE OF COMPETENT. IT'S A -- COMPETENCE.  IT REALLY IS. IT'S A MESSAGE OF COMMON SENSE   AND IT'S A MESSAGE OF  COMPETENCE.  I HAD NO IDEA THAT WE HAVE   MILLIONS OF MORE VOTES THAN WE   HAD WHEN WE HAD THAT STIFF MITT  ROMNEY, A TOTAL STIFF, RUNNING. WHO BY THE WAY, HE'S A DOPE. HE'S NOT A SMART PERSON. I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW. LET ME TELL BUT HIM. THAT WAS AN ELECTION THAT HE   SHOULD HAVE WON AND HE LOST. AND HE SHOULD JUST GO AWAY AND   LET THE BIG BOYS DO IT NOW.    THAT'S AN ELECTION THAT SHOULD   HAVE BEEN WON. I TELL YOU WHAT, I HELPED JOHN   MCCAIN, AND AT THAT TIME, HONESTLY, THAT WAS A TOUGH DEAL  FOR HIM. THE WORLD WAS SORT OF COLLAPSING. THAT WAS A TOUGH ONE.  BUT HE LOST. AND I HELPED MITT ROMNEY A LOT   AND HE LOST. AND I SAID, THIS TIME, WE'RE GOING TO DO IT OURSELVES. WE'RE GOING TO WIN.  WE'RE GOING TO WIN.  SO JUST REMEMBER THAT. WE'RE GOING TO WIN BECAUSE OF WISCONSIN. A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS. IS HOW ABOUT A WOMAN.  GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD. GREAT.  RIGHT.  SHE'S SO SMART, I DON'T WANT   THEM TO KNOW.  I DON'T WANT TO TELL PUTIN WHAT  I'M THINKING. SHE'S SO SMART.  WHAT YOU JUST SAID -- WHAT DOES THAT SAY? WHAT ABOUT -- DON'T WORRY ABOUT UKRAINE. THEY'RE GOING TO BE TYPE OF. JUST DON'T ASK ME WHY. THIS WORLD OF POLITICS.  MR. TRUMP, YOU SAID -- DON'T   FORGET, I'M THE ONE WHO SAID   TAKE THE OIL.  I WAS RIGHT. THEY DIDN'T. YOU KNOW WHO HAS THE OIL RIGHT   NOW? ISIS HAS THE OIL.  YOU KNOW THAT LIBYA, ISIS HAS  ALL THAT OIL FROM GADDAFI. ALL OF THAT BIG OIL FROM GADDAFI. I TOOK IT. WE'RE LIKE A BUNCH OF DUMMIES. WHY AREN'T WE CREATING A NICE  BIG CIRCLE SO THEY CAN'T GET THE OIL OUT? WHY AREN'T WE TAKING THAT OIL  BACK? LOOK, LOOK, I'M THE ONE THAT SAYS, THOUGH, I DON'T WANT TO SAY EVERYTHING.  IF I WIN, I HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF WINNING, I'M THE FRONTRUNNER  BY A LOT.  I WANT TO GO IN THERE, I WANT  TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS. I DON'T WANT TO TELL ALL -- I  REALLY MEAN THIS.  I DON'T WANT TO TELL EVERYBODY   IN THIS ROOM, AND LOOK AT ALL  THE CAMERAS THAT ARE GOING NOW.  I DON'T WANT TO TELL THE WORLD   WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. BECAUSE THEY'RE WATCHING.  JUST LET ME DO IT, FOLKS.  I WILL DO IT, YOU'LL BE SO   HAPPY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW THE   DETAILS. OK?  LET ME DO IT. I USE THE WORD BEFORE, WE HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT UNPREDICTABLE. WE CAN'T SAY, WELL, WE'RE GOING TO GO AND TAKE ON MARCH 14, AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO HIT THEM FROM THE FRONT, AND THEN WE'RE   GOING TO HIT THEM FROM THE   BACK.  OBAMA DID THAT EIGHT MONTHS ACTION WITH ONE OF THE CITIES. HE SAID, WE'RE GOING IN NEXT WEEK.  LOOK, FOLKS, FOLKS, FOLKS, YOU   KNOW, YOU HAVE TO TRUST -- THERE HAS TO BE SOME TRUST,  RIGHT? DO YOU TRUST? WE'VE GOT TO STOP THE STUPID. THAT'S WHY I REALLY THINK YOUR   QUESTION IS SO GREAT. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR HOW YOU'RE  GOING TO DO IT, MR. TRUMP, JUST  DO IT. I'LL DO IT. OK? I LOVE THAT. THAT WOMAN.  THAT WOMAN. THANK YOU, HONEY.  THANK YOU. YES, GO AHEAD.  I CAN SEE WHY.  I REMEMBER THAT.  I REMEMBER THAT.  SUCH A WONDERFUL, BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. JUST AN AMAZING WOMAN. ARE YOU COMING ALONG OK?  THAT'S GREAT.  WE'RE GOING TO WATCH HIM. TANNER, WATCH HIM. WE'RE GOING TO BE WATCHING YOUR BOY, OK? BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HOPEFULLY BE AROUND. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE ANYBODY WATCHING. WE'LL BE HELPING YOU.  THAT'S SO NICE. THANK YOU, HONEY.  THANK YOU. I'M SORRY. I HAVE TO GO DOWN AND SAY  HELLO. IS THAT OK?    WOW.  WHAT A GREAT WOMAN THAT IS.  THAT'S A GREAT WOMAN.  GREAT MOTHER. I REMEMBER THAT. AND IT'S HEARTBREAKING.  BUT SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL'S GOING  TO HAPPEN. YOU WATCH. SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL IS GOING TO  HAPPEN. FOLKS, I JUST WANT TO SAY, I'D ALMOST LIKE TO LEAVE IT ON THAT.  BECAUSE WE CAN'T TOP THAT. THAT IS SO AMAZING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.  THAT LITTLE -- VERY SAD, BUT I   THINK IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY A STORY OF HOPE. AND SOMETHING REALLY GREAT IS  GOING TO HAPPEN OUT OF THAT. YOU WATCH. BUT IT SORT OF TELLS ME, WHEN I  FIRST DID THIS PEOPLE SAID, OH, IT WILL COST A LOT.  FORGETTING ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN. THAT'S PEANUTS BY COMPARISON. I'VE SPENT TENS OF MILLIONS OF   DOLLARS. THE BIG THING I LOST, CERTAIN  BUSINESSES, I OWNED THE MISS   UNIVERSE PAGEANT. I BOUGHT IT INEXPENSIVELY 15   YEARS AGO. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY  THOUGHT I WAS AGAINST THIS ONE   OR THAT ONE, I HAD A HARD TIME   WITH TELEVISION. THE GOOD NEWS IS I SOLD IT FOR A WONDERFUL -- I WAS VERY  HAPPY, OK, WITH THAT.  BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO SELL IT.  BUT I SOLD IT. I BUILT IT TO REALLY A VERY  GOOD COMPANY. WE DID A GREAT JOB WITH THAT COMPANY. MISS UNIVERSE, MISS U.S.A., MISS TEEN U.S.A. OTHER BUSINESSES, I SORT OF -- LIKE THE SHIRTS AND TIES WITH MACY'S.  MACY'S WAS UNBELIEVABLE -- UNBELIEVABLY DISLOYAL BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.  THEY ENDED THE SHIRT SIZE --   WHO CARES. IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. BUT I'M DOING SOMETHING -- NOBODY ELSE IS GIVING UP WHAT  I'M GIVING. WHEN CRUZ RUNS HE RUNS.  IF HE WINS, GREAT, IF HE LOSES, GREAT. IT'S HIM.  HE'S A POLITICIAN. THEY JUST RUN, THEY WIN, THEY LOSE, WHO KNOWS. BUT THESE GUYS RUN FOR OFFICE. THAT'S ALL THEY DO.  I'VE ALWAYS HEARD THAT IF  YOU'RE A VERY SUCCESSFUL   PERSON, YOU CAN'T RUN FOR OFFICE ESPECIALLY FOR PRESIDENT. YOU CAN'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I CAN SEE IT.  I HAVE SO MUCH FALSE PRESS   ABOUT ME. THINGS THAT ARE SO FALSE, YOU  KNOW, I SAW THE OTHER DAY ON TELEVISION, THERE WERE LIKE 50   -- DID YOU SEE IT, 56,000 NEGATIVE ADS ON ME.  56,000. IN FACT, IN FLORIDA, I OWN DUR AL, IN FLORIDA, WE HAD THE   TOURNAMENT THERE TWO WEEKS AGO. ADAM SCOTT, THE GREAT ADAM   SCOTT. GREAT GOLFER.  HE WAS WINNING.  IN BETWEEN SHOTS I TOLD YOU  THIS AFTER THE VICTORY SPEECH,   THEY'VE HAD COMMERCIALS AND THEY WERE ALL ABOUT TRUMP. NEGATIVE. HORRIBLE, COMMEGTIVE -- NEGATIVE COMMERCIALS.  MOSTLY FALSE.  BUT IT CAME OUT THE OTHER DAY,   I THINK IT SAID $68 MILLION,   $55 -- 55,000 NEGATIVE ADS. NEGATIVE ADS.  AND WHEN I WAS RUNNING IN  FLORIDA, I SAID, HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO WIN? WITH ALL OF THIS, I KNEW IT,   YOU COULDN'T TURN -- IN  FLORIDA, WHERE I WAS, YOU  COULDN'T TURN ON THE TELEVISION  WITHOUT SEEING TRUMP COMMERCIALS. SOMETIMES FOUR, FIVE IN A ROW. AND THEY WERE HORRENDOUS. DONE BY VERY, VERY BAD PEOPLE. VERY BAD, EVIL PEOPLE. AND I SAID, HOW IS IT POSSIBLE   TO WIN?  AND GOD HELPED ME. HONESTLY.

HE FOCUSED HIS REMARKS ON THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND CRITICISM OF OBAMA'S FOREIGN POLICY IN THE  MIDDLE EAST. THIS IS 25 MINUTES.  MR. TRUMP: GOOD EVENING.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I SPEAK TO YOU TODAY AS A  LIFETIME SUPPORTER AND IT TRUE FRIEND OF ISRAEL.   I AM A NEWCOMER TO  POLITICS, BUT NOT TO BACKING GET  THE JEWISH STATE. IN 2001, WEEKS AFTER THE ATTACKS ON NEW YORK CITY, AND ON WASHINGTON, AND FRANKLY, THE  ATTACKS ON ALL OF US. ATTACKS THAT ARE TRADED -- THAT WERE PERPETRATED BY THE ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS. MAYOR MARY -- MAYOR RUDY  GIULIANI VISITED. I SENT MY PLANE BECAUSE I BACKED  THE MISSION OR ISRAEL 100%.   AND SPRING OF 2004,  AT THE HEIGHT OF THE VIOLENCE IN  THE GAZA STRIP, I WAS THE GRAND  MARSHAL OF THE 40TH SALUTE TO  ISRAEL PARADE. THE LARGEST SINGLE GATHERING IN  SUPPORT OF THE JEWISH STATE.   IT WAS A VERY  DANGEROUS TIME FOR ISRAEL, AND FRANKLY FOR ANYONE SUPPORTING ISRAEL.  MANY PEOPLE TURNED DOWN THIS  HONOR. I DID NOT. I TOOK THE RISK AND I AM GLAD I DID.   BUT I DID NOT COME HERE TONIGHT TO PANDER TO YOU  ABOUT ISRAEL. THAT IS WHAT POLITICIANS DO.  ALL TALK, NO ACTION. LATE ME. -- BELIEVE ME. I CAME TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT  WHERE I STAND ON THE FUTURE OF  AMERICAN RELATIONS WITH OUR STRATEGIC ALLY, OUR UNBREAKABLE  FRIENDSHIP, AND OUR CULTURAL  BROTHER. THE ONLY DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THE STATE OF ISRAEL.   THANK YOU. MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS TO DISMANTLE THE DISASTROUS DEAL  WITH IRAN.   THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS A LONG  TIME. I KNOW DEAL-MAKING AND LET ME TELL YOU, THIS DEAL IS  CATASTROPHIC FOR AMERICA, FOR  ISRAEL, AND FOR THE WHOLE OF THE  MIDDLE EAST.   THE PROBLEM IS  FUNDAMENTAL, WE HAVE REWARD THE  WORLD'S LEADING STATE-SPONSORED  TERROR WITH $150 BILLION AND WE RECEIVED ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN RETURN.   I HAVE STUDIED THIS  ISSUE IN GREAT DETAIL. I WOULD SAY, ACTUALLY, GREATER  BY FAR THAN ANYBODY ELSE.  BELIEVE ME. OH, BELIEVE ME. AND IT IS A BAD DEAL. THE BIGGEST CONCERN WITH THE  DEAL IS NOT NECESSARILY THAT IRAN IS GOING TO VIOLATE IT, BECAUSE ALREADY, YOU KNOW, AS  YOU KNOW, IT HAS. THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS THAT THEY CAN KEEP THE TERMS AND STILL GET  THE BOMB BY SIMPLY RUNNING OUT  THE CLOCK. AND OF COURSE, THEY WILL KEEP THE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF  DOLLARS THAT WE SO STUPIDLY AND  FOOLISHLY GAVE THEM.   THE DEAL DOES NOT  EVEN REQUIRE IRAN TO DISMANTLE  ITS MILITARY NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES.  YES, IT PLACES LIMITS ON ITS MILITARY NUCLEAR PROGRAM FOR  ONLY A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS, BUT WHEN THOSE RESTRICTIONS EXPIRE, IRAN WILL HAVE AN INDUSTRIAL-SIZED MILITARY  NUCLEAR CAPABILITY READY TO GO AND WITH ZERO PROVISION FOR DELAY NO MATTER HOW BAD IRAN'S BEHAVIOR IS.  TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE SITUATION WE  ARE ALL PLACED IN AND ESPECIALLY  ISRAEL.   WHEN I AM PRESIDENT,  I WILL ADOPT A STRATEGY THAT  FOCUSES ON THREE THINGS WHEN IT  COMES TO IRAN. FIRST, WE WILL STAND UP TO  IRAN'S AGGRESSIVE PUSH TO  DESTABILIZE AND DOMINATE THE REGION.   I RAN AS A VERY BIG  PROBLEM AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE,  BUT IF I AM NOT ELECTED PRESIDENT, I KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH TROUBLE AND BELIEVE ME THAT  IS WHY I AM GOING TO BE ELECTED  PRESIDENT, FOLKS.   AND WE ARE LEADING AN EVER -- WE ARE LEADING IN EVERY HOLE. REMEMBER THAT, PLEASE.  IRAN IS A PROBLEM IN IRAQ,  SYRIA, LEBANON, YEMEN, AND WILL  BE A VERY, VERY MAJOR PROBLEM FOR SAUDI ARABIA.  EVERY DAY I RAN PROVIDES MORE AND BETTER WEAPONS TO SUPPORT  THEIR PUPPET STATES. HEZBOLLAH, LEBANON RECEIVED, AND  I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, IT HAS  RECEIVED SOPHISTICATED ANTI-SHIP  WEAPONS. ANTI-AIRCRAFT WEAPONS. AND, GPS SYSTEMS AND ROCKETS LIKE VERY FEW PEOPLE EVER WEAR IN THE WORLD AND VERY FEW  COUNTRIES HAVE. NOW THEY ARE IN SYRIA TRYING TO ESTABLISH ANOTHER FRONT AGAINST  ISRAEL FROM THE SYRIAN SIDE OF  THE GOAL AND HEIGHTS. IN GAZA, AROUND THE IS SUPPORTING HAMAS AND ISLAM A  JIHAD. IN THE WEST BANK, THEY ARE OPENLY OFFERING PALESTINIANS $7,000 FOR TERROR ATTACKS IN TO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EVERY PALESTINIAN TERRORIST HOME THAT HAS BEEN DESTROYED. A DEPLORABLE, DEPLORABLE  SITUATION.   IRAN IS FINANCING MILITARY FORCES THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST AND IT IS INCREDIBLE  WE HANDED THEM OVER 100 IF THE BILLION DOLLARS -- $150 BILLION TO DO EVEN MORE HORRIBLE ACTS OF TERROR.   SECONDLY, WE WILL TOTALLY DISMANTLE IRAN'S GLOBAL TERROR NETWORK, WHICH IS BIG AND POWERFUL BUT NOT POWERFUL LIKE US.   IRAN HAS SEATED TERROR GROUPS ALL OVER THE WORLD. DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS, IRAN  HAS PERPETUATED TERRORIST ATTACKS IN 25 DIFFERENT  COUNTRIES ON FIVE CONTINENTS. THEY HAVE TERRORIST CELLS  EVERYWHERE, INCLUDING IN THE  WESTERN HEMISPHERE VERY CLOSE TO  HOME. I RAN IS THE BIGGEST SPONSOR OF TERRORISM AROUND THE WORLD AND WE WILL WORK TO DISMANTLE THAT  REACH.  HE LEAVE ME. BELIEVE ME. -- BELIEVE ME, HE LEAVE ME. -- THIRD, AT THE VERY LEAST WE  MUST ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE  PREVIOUS DEAL TO HOLD A RAN TOTALLY ACCOUNTABLE AND WE WILL  AND FORCE IT LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER  SEEN A CONTRACT AND FORCED  BEFORE, FOLKS. BELIEVE ME. IRAN HAS ALREADY, SINCE THE DEAL  WAS IN PLACE, TESTFIRED BALLISTIC MISSILE'S THREE TIMES. THOSE BALLISTIC MISSILES, WITH A  RANGE OF 1250 MILES, WERE  DESIGNED TO INTIMIDATE NOT ONLY ISRAEL, WHICH IS ONLY 600 MILES AWAY, BUT ALSO INTENDED TO FRIGHTEN EUROPE AND SOMEDAY,  MAYBE, HIT EVEN THE UNITED  STATES. AND, WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET  THAT HAPPEN. WE ARE NOT LETTING THAT HAPPEN  AND WE ARE NOT LETTING THAT  HAPPEN TO ISRAEL. BELIEVE ME.   THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DO YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING  REALLY SHOCKING? AS MANY OF THE GREAT PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM KNOW, PAINTED AND  THOSE MISSILES AND BOTH HEBREW  AND FARSI WERE THE WORDS, ISRAEL  MUST BE WEIGHED -- WIPED OFF THE  FACE OF THE EARTH. YOU CAN FORGET THAT. WHAT KIND OF DEMENTED MINDS OF RIGHT THAT IN HEBREW? AND HERE'S ANOTHER.  TALK ABOUT TWISTED. HERE IS ANOTHER TWISTED PART. TESTING THESE MISSILES DOES NOT  EVEN VIOLATE THE HORRIBLE DEALS THAT WE MADE. THE DEAL IS SILENT ON TEST MISSILES. BUT THOSE TESTS DO VIOLATE THE UNITED NATION SECURITY COUNCIL  REGULATIONS. THE PROBLEM IS NO ONE HAS DONE  ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  WE WILL. WE WILL. I PROMISE, WE WILL.   THANK YOU. WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT  POINT. THE EDITOR WEAKNESS AND  INCOMPETENCE OF THE UNITED  NATIONS. -- THE UTYTER WEAKNESS AND  INCOMPETENCE OF THE UNITED  NATIONS. THE UNITED NATIONS IS NOT A  FRIEND OF DEMOCRACY.  IT IS NOT A FRIEND TO FREEDOM. IT IS NOT A FRIEND EVEN TO THE  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHERE,  AS YOU KNOW, IT HAS ITS HOME.  AND IT SURELY IS NOT A FRIEND TO  ISRAEL.   WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA IN HIS FINAL YEAR, YAY!   HE MAY BE THE WORST  THING TO EVER HAPPEN TO ISRAEL.  BELIEVE ME. BELIEVE ME. AND YOU KNOW IT, AND YOU KNOW IT  BETTER THAN ANYBODY. SO WITH THE PRESIDENT HAS FINAL  YEARS, DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN  SWIRLING ABOUT AN ATTEMPT TO BRING A SECURITY RESOLUTION TO  TERMS ABOUT AN EVENTUAL RESOLUTION BETWEEN PALESTINE AND ISRAEL.  LET ME BE CLEAR, AN AGREEMENT IMPOSED BY THE UNITED NATIONS WOULD BE A TOTAL AND COMPLETE DISASTER.   THE UNITED STATES  MUST OPPOSE THIS RESOLUTION AND  USE THE POWER OF OUR VETO, WHICH  I WILL USE AS PRESIDENT 100%.  WHEN PEOPLE ASK WHY, IT IS  BECAUSE THAT IS NOT HOW YOU MAKE  A DEAL. DEALS ARE MADE WHEN PARTIES COME  TOGETHER. THEY COME TO A TABLE AND  NEGOTIATE.  EACH SIDE MUST GIVE UP  SOMETHING. IT'S VALUES I MEAN, WE HAVE TO  DO SOMETHING WHERE THERE IS  VALUE IN EXCHANGE FOR SOMETHING  REQUIRED. THAT IS WHEN A DEAL IS.  WHEN WE IMPOSE IT ON ISRAEL AND  PALESTINE, WE BRING TOGETHER A  GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT COME TOGETHER WITH SOMETHING.  THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN WITH THE  STATIONS. IT WILL ONLY FURTHER -- VERY  IMPORTANTLY, IT WILL ONLY FURTHER DELEGITIMIZING ISRAEL. IT WILL BE A DISASTER FOR  ISRAEL. IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN,  FOWLKES! AND FURTHER, IT WOULD REWARD TERRORISM BECAUSE EVERY DAY THEY ARE STABBING ISRAELIS AND EVEN AMERICANS.  JUST LAST WEEK, A WEST POINT GRADUATE, PHENOMENAL YOUNG  PERSON WHO SERVED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, WAS MURDERED IN THE  STREET BY A KNIFE-WIELDING  PALESTINIAN. YOU DO NOT REWARD BEHAVIOR LIKE THAT.  YOU CAN NOT DO IT.   THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY  YOU TREAT THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR. YOU HAVE TO CONFRONT IT.   SO IT IS NOT UP TO  THE UNITED NATIONS TO REALLY GO  INTO A SOLUTION. IT IS REALLY THE PARTIES THAT  MUST NEGOTIATE A RESOLUTION THEMSELVES. THEY HAVE NO CHOICE.  THEY HAVE TO DO IT THEMSELVES OR WILL NEVER HOLD UP ANYWHERE. THE UNITED STATES CAN BE USEFUL  AS A FACILITATOR OF NEGOTIATIONS, BUT NO ONE SHOULD  BE TELLING ISRAEL THAT IT MUST BE -- AND REALLY THAT IT MUST  ABIDE BY SOME AGREEMENT MADE BY OTHERS THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY THAT DO NOT TO EVEN REALLY KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ISRAEL, TO  ANYTHING IN THE AREA. IT IS SO PREPOSTEROUS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN.   WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, BELIEVE ME, I WILL VETO ANY ATTEMPT BY THE UNITED NATIONS TO  IMPOSE ITS WILL ON THE JEWISH  STATE. IT WILL BE VETOED 100%.   YOU SEE, I KNOW ABOUT  DEALMAKING.  THAT IS WHAT I DO. I WROTE ""THE ART OF THE DEAL."" ONE OF THE BEST-SELLING, ALL  TIME. AND I MEAN, SERIOUSLY. I AM GOING TO BE VERY  DIPLOMATIC. ONE OF -- I'LL BE CRITICIZED, I  THINK IT IS NUMBER ONE, BUT WHY  TAKE A CHANCE? ONE OF THE ALL-TIME BEST-SELLING  BOOKS ABOUT DEALS AND  DEALMAKING. TO MAKE A GREAT DEAL, YOU NEED IT TO WILLING PARTICIPANTS. WE KNOW ISRAEL IS WILLING TO DEAL.  ISRAEL HAS BEEN TRYING. RIGHT. ISRAEL HAS BEEN TRYING TO SIT  DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE  WITHOUT PRECONDITIONS FOR YEARS. YOU HAD CAMP DAVID IN 2000,  WHERE PRIME MINISTER BARAK MADE  AN INCREDIBLE OFFER, MAYBE EVEN  TOO GENEROUS. ARAFAT REJECTED IT. IN 2008, AND EQUALLY GENEROUS OFFER TO PALESTINIAN -- THE  PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY REJECTED  IT ALSO. THEN JOHN KERRY TRIED TO COME UP  WITH A FRAMEWORK AND A BOSS DID  NOT EVEN -- AND ABBAS DID NOT  EVEN RESPOND.  NOT EVEN TO THE SECRETARY OF  STATE OF THE HUMAN -- UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  THEY DID NOT EVEN RESPOND.   THANK YOU. AND, WHEN I SAY SOMETHING I MEAN  IT.  I MEAN IT. I WILL MEET WITH PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU IMMEDIATELY. I HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR MANY YEARS AND WILL BE ABLE TO WORK CLOSELY  TOGETHER WITH HIM TO HELP BRING  STABILITY AND PEACE TO ISRAEL AND TO THE ENTIRE REGION. MEANWHILE, EVERY SINGLE DAY, YOU  HAVE RAMPANT INCITEMENT AND CHILDREN BEING TAUGHT TO HATE  ISRAEL AND TO HATE THE JEWS. IT HAS TO STOP.   WHEN YOU LIVE IN AN  SOCIETY WHERE FIREFIGHTERS ARE  HEROES, LITTLE KIDS WANT TO BE FIREFIGHTERS.  WHEN YOU LIVE IN A SOCIETY  WHEREAT ATHLETES AND MOVIE STARS  ARE HEROES, LITTLE KIDS WANT TO  BE ATHLETES AND MOVIE STARS. IN PALESTINIAN SOCIETY, THE  HEROES ARE THOSE WHO MURDER  JEWS. WE CANNOT LET THIS CONTINUE. WE CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN ANY LONGER. YOU --    YOU CANNOT ACHIEVE THESE IF TERRORISTS ARE TREATED -- YOU CANNOT ACHIEVE PEACE OF  TERRORISTS ARE TREATED AS  MODERATES. -- MURDERS. IT IS A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE WAY  TO THINK. IT IS A BARRIER THAT CANNOT BE  BROKEN.  THAT WILL END.  IT WILL LEND SOON.  BELIEVE ME. AND PALESTINIAN TEXTBOOKS IN  MOSQUES, YOU HAVE A CULTURE OF HATRED THAT HAS BEEN FOMENTING  THERE FOR YEARS. IF WE WANT TO ACHIEVE PEACE, THEY HAVE GOT TO GO OUT AND IF  THEY HAVE GOT TO START THIS  EDUCATIONAL PROCESS. THEY HAVE TO AND EDUCATION OF  HATRED. THEY HAVE TO AND IT. AND, NOW! THERE IS NO MORAL EQUIVALENCY. ISRAEL DOES NOT NAME PUBLIC  SQUARES AFTER TERRORISTS. ISRAEL DOES NOT PAY ITS CHILDREN  TO STAB RANDOM PALESTINIANS. YOU SEE, WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA GETS WRONG ABOUT DEALMAKING IS THAT HE CONSTANTLY APPLIES  PRESSURE TO OUR FRIENDS AND  REWARDS OUR ENEMIES.   PRESIDENT OBAMA THINKS THAT APPLYING PRESSURE TO  ISRAEL WILL FORCE THE ISSUE. BUT IT IS PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE THAT HAPPENS. ALREADY HALF OF THE POPULATION OF PALESTINE HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER  BY THE PALESTINIAN ISIS AND  HAMAS. THE OTHER HALF REFUSES TO  CONFRONT THE FIRST HALF, SO IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION THAT IS NEVER GOING TO GET  SOLVED UNLESS YOU HAVE GREAT LEADERSHIP RIGHT HERE IN THE  UNITED STATES. WE WILL GET IT DONE ONE WAY OR  THE OTHER.  WE WILL GET IT SOLVED.   BUT WHEN THE UNITED STATES STANDS WITH ISRAEL, THE CHANCES OF THESE REALLY RISE AND RISES EXPONENTIALLY.  THAT IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN  DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.    WE WILL MOVE THE  AMERICAN EMBASSY TO THE ETERNAL  CAPITAL OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE. JERUSALEM.   AND WE WILL SEND A  CLEAR SIT ON THAT THERE IS NO DAYLIGHT BETWEEN AMERICA AND OUR MOST RELIABLE ALLY, THE STATE OF  ISRAEL. THE PALESTINIANS MUST COME TO  THE TABLE KNOWING THAT THE BOND BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL IS ABSOLUTELY, TOTALLY  UNBREAKABLE.   THEY MUST COME TO THE  TABLE, WILLING AND ABLE, TO STOP  THE TERROR OF BEING COMMITTED BY A -- ON A DAILY BASIS AGAINST  ISRAEL. A MUST DO THAT.  IN, THEY MUST COME TO THE TABLE  WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT ISRAEL IS  A JEWISH STATE AND IT WILL  FOREVER EXIST AS A JEWISH STATE.   I LOVE THE PEOPLE IN  THIS ROOM.  I LOVE ISRAEL. I LOVE ISRAEL. I HAVE BEEN WITH ISRAEL FOR SO  LONG IN TERMS OF I RECEIVED SOME  OF MY GREATEST HONORS FROM ISRAEL.  MY FATHER BEFORE ME.  MY DAUGHTER IS ABOUT TO HAVE A  BEAUTIFUL JEWISH BABY.   IN FACT, IT COULD BE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WHICH IS  VERY NICE AS FAR AS I AM  CONCERNED. THANK YOU ALL, INC. YOU. WINKY THERE HE MUCH. -- THANK YOU ALL, THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

WE ARE GETTING SO MANY QUESTIONS  ON THE BUILDING ITSELF, HOW IT'S  COMING AND THIS IS A GREAT SPEAKER SYSTEM, BOY.  UNBELIEVABLE. AND JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY  FOR COMING. WE HAVE HAD SO MANY INQUIRIES AS  TO HOW WE ARE DOING AT THE OLD   POST OFFICE, WHAT WAS FORMERLY   THE OLD POST OFFICE.  THE ROOMS ARE ALMOST COMPLETE.  CLOSE TO 300 ROOMS, SUPER LUXURY AND GOING TO BE AMAZING AND   GOING TO EMPLOY SUBSTANTIALLY   MORE THAN I WOULD SAY 500   PEOPLE, AT LEAST 500 PEOPLE AND GETTING THEM LARGELY FROM THE AREA AND THEY ARE ALREADY IN TRAINING.   OUR CHEFS HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED,   OUR SERVICE STAFF HAS BEEN FULLY EMPLOYED.   SO WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS GROUP OF  PEOPLE.   THE HOTEL IS GOING TO BE   INCREDIBLE. MUCH OF WHAT YOU ARE SITTING ON,  THAT WAS OPEN SPACE GOING INTO A BASEMENT AREA, THAT IS A BRAND NEW FLOOR AND GETS COVERED WITH BEAUTIFUL MARBLE FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD. MUCH OF WHAT YOU ARE SEEING HERE  GETS THE FINAL TOUCHES ON IT.   THIS WAS ONE OF THE GREAT BUILDINGS IN WASHINGTON, IN THE   COUNTRY AND RESTORED TO THE   HIGHEST LEVEL, WELL BEYOND FROM   WHEN IT WAS BUILT AND IT'S GOING  TO BE SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL.   WHEN IT'S COMPLETED, IT WILL BE   TRULY ONE OF THE GREAT HOTELS OF  THE WORLD AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE  LOOKING FORWARD TO. THIS WAS G.S.A. AND ONE OF THE   MOST HEAVILY BID PROJECTS EVER IN THE HISTORY OF G.S.A. TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WANTED IT.  THEY BOUGHT IT DOWN TO 10   FINALISTS AND WE GOT IT BECAUSE   OF THE STRENGTH OF OUR FINANCIAL  STATEMENT AND THEY WANTED SOMETHING BUILT AND SOMETHING SPECIAL IN TERMS OF THE CONCEPT.  WHERE YOU ARE NOW IS PART OF THE HOTEL LOBBY AND WILL SEE THAT IN THREE MONTHS. AND BEHIND ME ARE RESTAURANTS,   STORES AND SHOPS AND EVERYTHING   ABOVE THE SECOND FLOOR IS ROOMS,  SUITES, LUXURY SUITES A WE ARE   BUILDING ONE OF THE BIGGEST   BALLROOMS IN WASHINGTON. THE LARGEST LUXURY BALLROOM IN WASHINGTON AND IN THE WASHINGTON  AREA. IT WILL BE A VERY, VERY SPECIAL JOB.  WE ARE PROUD OF IT.   WE ARE TWO YEARS AHEAD OF   SCHEDULE. WE WILL BE OPENING IN SEPTEMBER.  SO THAT'S MUCH IN ADVANCE OF   WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE.   IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SEPTEMBER   TWO YEARS FROM NOW.   WE ARE RIGHT ON BUDGET AND   INCREASED THE SCOPE OF THE WORK   QUITE A BIT.  WE ARE STILL ON BUDGET AND HAVE   GONE TO A HIGHER AGREE OF   FINISHES AND MARBLES AND FIXTURES, BATHROOM FIXTURES, WINDOWS, ET CETERA. WE WANT TO MAKE THIS ONE OF THE   GREAT HOTELS OF THE WORLD. I THINK IT'S COMING OUT THAT WAY AND WHEN IT'S COMPLETED, YOU WILL BE PROUD OF IT. IT'S A GREAT THING FOR THE COUNTRY AND WASHINGTON. IT WAS SITTING SHALLOW FOR MANY,  MANY DECADES BUT IT WAS FOR MANY YEARS, IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT BUILDING AND THERE WAS FIGHTS AS  TO WHETHER IT WOULD STAY UP AND GROUPS GOT TOGETHER AND NEVER   ALLOWED THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE IT DOWN. WE STARTED IT ABOUT A YEAR AND-A-HALF AGO AND WILL HAVE IT   FINISHED WAY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. I THINK YOU WILL BE PROUD OF IT   AS PEOPLE WHO LOVE THIS COUNTRY, I THINK YOU WILL BE PROUD OF IT. THIS IS SOME OF THE STAFF WE HAVE, SOME OF THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND PROBABLY CLOSE TO   1,000 CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ON   THE THE ON SITE.  THE WINDOWS WHICH ARE LANDMARK,   MUCH OF THE BUILDING IS LANDMARK.   THE WALLS ARE LANDMARK, THE   STRUTS -- IT'S ALL A VERY STRONG LANDMARK SITUATION. WE WORKED WITH THE VARIOUS LANDMARKING GROUPS THAT WERE TERRIFIC, REALLY PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE AND LOVE THIS BUILDING. THE EXETER I DON'T REMEMBER OF THE BUILDING -- EXTERIOR OF THE BUILDING IS GRAN IT AND DON'T BUILD THEM LIKE THAT ANY MORE.  IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND.    WE MET WITH SENATOR   SESSIONS AND SOME OF THE GREAT PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON AND YOU   PRETTY KNOW WHO WAS THERE, I   WOULD IMAGINE. WE HAD A GREAT MEETING.    WE CAN PROVIDE A LIST FOR YOU.   WE ARE VERY INCLUSIVE, JEFF AND SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE INVITED A SMALL   GROUP AND WE ARE DOING VERY WELL  AND LOOKS LIKE WE ARE DOING VERY  WELL IN ARIZONA AND EVERY PLACE ELSE AND EASILY MAKE THAT NUMBER OF THE 1,237 AND SHOULD MAKE IT   EASILY BASED ON WHAT I'M SEEING SO WE WON'T WORRY ABOUT FIGHTING  AT A CONVENTION.   I'M VERY DIFFERENT   THAN HILLARY CLINTON, TO PUT IT MILDLY. WE HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT STYLE. I DON'T THINK SHE WILL BE ONE WHO IS GOING TO DO MUCH WITH OUR  TRADE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE   KILLING OUR COUNTRY.  PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA HOW   IMPORTANT THAT IS.  THE MONEY THAT IS BEING DRAINED   OUT OF OUR QUESTION IS ENORMOUS AND THAT'S NOT HER THING.   THAT'S TOTALLY MY THING.  SHE WILL BE WEAK ON THE MILITARY  AND WEAK FRANKLY WITH OTHER   COUNTRIES AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SUBSIDIZE THEM WITH OUR  MILITARY, WHICH NOBODY TALKS ABOUT.  WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY   SOLVENT AND MAKE OUR COUNTRY   RICH IF WE ARE GOING TO SAVE   THESE THINGS AND REBUILD OUR MILITARY. IT'S IN VERY BAD SHAPE.   IT HAS BEEN DECEMBER IMMATED AND  GET THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT AND NOT   THE WRONG EQUIPMENT.  WE WANT TO GET THE EQUIPMENT   THEY WANT, NOT THE EQUIPMENT THEY ARE GETTING BECAUSE   POLITICIANS HAVE ACCESS TO   CERTAIN COMPANIES AND WE ARE GOING TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY.  AND THAT WILL BE A BIG DIFFERENCE ALSO.   HER POLICIES   OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T WORK.  LOOK AT LIBYA AND LOOK AT   ANYTHING YOU WANT TO LOOK AT AND  THEY HAVEN'T WORKED AND IF YOU   LOOK BACK AT MY PROJECTIONS AND MY FIGURES, THEY TURN OUT TO BE VERY, VERY ACCURATE.   I'M GOING TO MAKE A SPEECH IN ABOUT TWO HOURS.  I ALSO SAID -- I SAID WHAT I SAID, REMEMBER I SAID I WANT TO   LOOK INTO IT AND SPEAK TO   GOVERNMENTAL PEOPLE IN ISRAEL   AND HERE.   AND I WANT TO SPEAK TO VARIOUS SENATORS, INCLUDING SENATOR   SESSIONS, JEFF IS HIGHLY RESPECTED AND TED CRUZ RESPECTED  HIM MORE THAN ANY SENATOR AND   THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO GET ENDORSED BY JEFF SESSIONS AND HE  DIDN'T. JEFF SESSIONS ENDORSED ME AND TED CRUZ DOESN'T BELIEVE WHAT   HAPPENED.   THEY WORKED TOGETHER.   AND DOESN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT   SOMEBODY WHEN YOU HAVE ALMOST NO  SENATE ENDORSEMENTS BUT YOU HAVE  NO SENATE ENDORSEMENTS AND YOU WORK WITH THE PEOPLE ALL THE   TIME.   WE WORKED VERY, VERY CLOSELY   WITH MANY PEOPLE BUT JEFF   SESSIONS.   WE WORKED CLOSELY WITH TOP   PEOPLE FROM ISRAEL AND I'M GOING  TO BE MAKING A SPEECH ABOUT IT   IN A LITTLE WHILE.   I WAS ASKED CERTAIN   QUESTIONS AND SAID I WANT TO MAKE A DECISION.  AND I WILL DO IT TODAY AT 5:00.  >>  HERE?  WE ARE DOING SOME OF THAT ALREADY.  WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR, WHAT   KIND OF A POSITION?   COME UP HERE. SMART, GOOD.  DO YOU MIND IF I DO A JOB   INTERVIEW RIGHT NOW?  WE NEED GOOD PEOPLE.  WHAT'S YOUR EXPERIENCE?  HERE'S WHAT I'M GOING  TO DO. HERE'S THE MAN.   STAND RIGHT OVER HERE.  SHE IS PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE A   JOB.  HAVE A GOOD TIME.  JUST TO START GETTING  TOGETHER WITH SOME OF THE PEOPLE  I HAVE KNOWN OVER THE YEARS,   POLITICIANS AND JUST ABOUT ALL   CASES, THEY WERE SENATORS OR CONGRESSMEN. JIM DEMINT.   WE HAD A GOOD MEETING AND CAN'T BELIEVE HOW FAR WE'VE COME.   I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE MAYBE   WOULDN'T HAVE PREDICTED THAT.   PEOPLE WHO KNOW ME DID PREDICT THAT.   IT IS A BEGINNING MEETING BUT IT  WAS A VERY GOOD ONE WITH A LOT   OF THE MOST RESPECTED PEOPLE IN   WASHINGTON.  VERY SIMPLE, I HAVE MORE VOTES THAN ANYBODY AND IF   YOU TAKE AWAY THE FACT WE HAD 17  PEOPLE, I HAD 17 PEOPLE GOING   AGAINST. HILLARY ESSENTIALLY HAD ONE.  I HAD MORE VOTES THAN ANYBODY, MORE VOTES HAVE COME IN THE PRIMARIES TO ME THAN ANYBODY   ELSE. AND YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM WITH   THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW, IT'S SO   DIVIDED AND PEOPLE LIKE ELIZABETH WARREN HAVE TO GET   THEIR ACT TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S   GOING TO STAY DIVIDED AND IT   INCLUDES HILLARY AND INCLUDES   ME. THIS COUNTRY HAS TO GET TOGETHER.   WE ARE SITTING ON A FAT   FINANCIAL BUBBLE AND IT IS 19   TRILLION AND WE HAVE A MILITARY THAT NEEDS MONEY.   WE HAVE EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS   MONEY AND WE HAVE HEALTH CARE THAT DOESN'T WORK.  OBAMACARE IS NOT WORKING. NOTHING WRONGS.  -- NOTHING WORKS.   WE ARE RANKED LAST IN MANY CASES.  EVERYBODY HAS TO GET TOGETHER   AND GET IT SOLVED.  IF THEY DON'T GET TOGETHER, WE   AREN'T GOING TO HAVE MUCH OF A   COUNTRY.  WHEN DID HE SAY THIS?  I KNOW THE PASTOR AND HE IS VERY RESPECTED PERSON.  I LOOKED AT HER AND I HAVE GUT INSTINCT AND WE ARE   ALLOWED TO HAVE THAT AND I LOOKED AT HER AND ASKED A   QUESTION AND IT WAS A VERY   POSITIVE QUESTION AND LOOKS LIKE  SHE HAS A GREAT LOOK -- LOOK AT   THAT WITH THE TEARS. HOW NICE. SEEMED LIKE A GOOD PERSON TO ME. NOW MAYBE SHE WON'T QUALIFY   BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO QUALIFY, BUT  I THINK SHE WILL.   SHELL LOOKED TO ME LIKE SHE IS A GOOD PERSON.  I HAVE GOOD INSTINCTS.  I HAVE A GOOD INSTINCT ABOUT YOU  AND YOU ARE A VERY FINE   REPORTER. SHE MADE THE IMMEDIATE   IMPRESSION. TOMORROW SHE'LL MOVE OUT TO HOLLYWOOD. GO AHEAD.  GIVE ME A BREAK.   ON SUPER TUESDAY, I WON FOUR OUT  OF FIVE AND DID WELL IN OHIO.   AND IF I HAD TWO MORE DAYS IN OHIO, I WOULD HAVE WON IT.  WE HAVE SO MANY   PEOPLE CALLING AND IN TERMS OF   DELEGATES, THE DELEGATES YOU ARE HEARING ABOUT WANT TO COME WITH   US. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO GET A   LOT OF DELEGATES. SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING WE ARE GOING TO BE AT 14, 15.  WE'LL SEE. THE WORST THAT HAPPENS, I GO BACK TO THIS, WHICH ISN'T SO BAD.  BUT I THINK WE ARE DOING VERY,   VERY WELL. AND I THINK WE WILL QUALIFY OVER THAT NUMBER. AND IF WE ARE 30 SHORT OR 50   SHORT, NOBODY ELSE IS GOING TO   BE CLOSE.   TED CRUZ WON'T EVEN BE CLOSE AND  IF WE ARE A LITTLE BIT SHORT, PEOPLE HAVE TO DECIDE ARE YOU   GOING TO GO WITH SOMEBODY. REMEMBER.   THIS IS IMPORTANT.  WHEN I WAS PUTTING MY DELEGATES TOGETHER, I GUESS WE STARTED, THERE MUST HAVE BEEN 12 OR 14   PEOPLE IN THE RACE.   IT WASN'T LIKE I WAS RUNNING   AGAINST ONE OR TWO PEOPLE.  EASY TO PUT TOGETHER THE 1,237 DELEGATES.  BUT I HAD SENATORS, I HAD A GREAT DOCTOR, I HAD CARLY AND MANY, MANY OTHER PEOPLE RUNNING. I WAS DOING WELL AND I WAS   LEADING THE PACK.   BUT PEOPLE WERE 5%, 10%, 15%.   TO GET 50% IS A LITTLE BIT UNFAIR WHEN YOU HAVE A GROUP OF   PEOPLE THAT STARTED OUT AT AROUND 12.  WHEN WE GOT TO THE ELECTIONS, THE PRIMARIES, IT WAS AROUND 12   OR 13 PEOPLE. THEN THEY STARTED LEAVING. BUT YOU KNOW, EVEN NOW, WE HAVE THE THREE. HILLARY HAD ONE. MUCH DIFFERENT. MUCH DIFFERENT. AND I THINK I WOULD LOVE THE REPORTERS, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO   MAKE THAT POINT.  WE HAVE A LOT OF DELEGATES. WE ARE ALMOST UP TO 700 WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY MORE THAN ANYBODY   ELSE, BUT I GOT THE DELEGATES   THE HARD WAY AND RUNNING AGAINST MANY, MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE. ALL ACCOMPLISHED, ALL SENATORS, GOVERNORS, SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE.   NOW WE'RE DOWN TO THREE AND   WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.  I'M AN OUTSIDER.   I UNDERSTAND IT. THERE ARE SENATORS, GOVERNORS, CONGRESSMEN, MEN AND WOMEN AND   THEY AREN'T USED TO THIS AND A   LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT   BECAUSE I HAVEN'T TAKEN CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS.  THEY WANT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS  AND A LOT OF THE PEOPLE, THE DONORS, SOME OF THOSE ARE FRIENDS OF MINE. I HAD DONORS COME UP TO MY OFFICE OFFER ME MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND SAID I WOULD LOVE TO  TAKE IT, BUT I CAN'T. BY THE WAY, HE SAID I'M GOING TO  GO WITH SOMEONE ELSE. I SAID WHY. HE SAID I HAVE TO.  THEY ARE GAMBLERS. WHEN I SAID I DON'T WANT YOUR   MONEY, THEY GO SOMEPLACE ELSE. THEY DO THAT.   THEY ARE GAMBLERS IN A CERTAIN SENSE.  YES, GO AHEAD.  DR. CARSON IS A GREAT  GUY.  HE CAME OVER AND WE MET AND HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. ONCE I GOT TO KNOW HIM AND KNOW ME, HE IS A FINEMAN, A FINE PERSON WITH A GREAT FAMILY. WE WILL BE TALKING TO BEN CARSON ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS. THAT'S GREAT.   I'M GLAD THAT YOU TOLD ME THAT.   I KNOW THAT. THANK YOU.  YES. I GAVE THEM PAGE ONE.  I USED ALSO MY SON-IN-LAW WHERE IS HE? HIS WIFE IS ABOUT TWO MINUTES AWAY FROM HAVING A BABY. SO HE'S HERE AND COMING TO APAC. JAR ODD SPOKE TO MANY OF HIS FRIENDS FROM ISRAEL AND WE PUT   TOGETHER A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE. IVANKA IS HAVING A BABY AND HE   IS GETTING READY TO GET GOING.  HE HAS A DIFFERENT OPINION.  BUT I DO LIKE DIFFERENT OPINIONS. YES, GO AHEAD.  CHINESE TOURISTS WILL  BE INVOLVED.  INVESTMENT I DON'T NEED.  THEY DON'T HAVE TO GIVE ME THEIR MONEY.  BUT THE TOURISTS, WE WANT TOURISTS FROM CHINA.  I DON'T THINK SO.  I THINK WE WILL DO FINE IN UTAH.  WASN'T ONE OF THE STATES WE WERE  PROJECTED TO WIN, BUT I HAD ONE   SPEECH THERE AND IT WAS MASSIVE.  WE TURNED AWAY 5,000 PEOPLE.  YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED.  AND I THINK WE'LL DO WELL THERE.  WASN'T A STATE.   I WAS GOING OUT TO ARIZONA AND I  HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS IN UTAH   AND WE STOPPED AND MADE A SPEECH  AND HAD A GREAT RESPONSE TO IT.   I DON'T KNOW.   I DON'T KNOW. THERE WILL BE SOME. GO AHEAD.  NO.  YES.   I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT   ABOUT THEM LEAVING.   I'M THERE A LOT.  I HAVE A LOT OF INVESTMENTS IN THE U.K. AND I THINK THEY MAY LEAVE BASED ON EVERYTHING I'M   HEARING.  YOU HAVE TO ASK THEM.  I JUST THINK THEY MAY LEAVE.  THE HEAD OF MEXICO   WANTS TO DO THAT?   WE ARE GOING TO BRING IT BACK.  WE ARE GOING TO BRING IT BACK.  LOOK, WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS TRADE DEFICIT WITH MEXICO, $58 BILLION. WE HAVE TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS   COMING ACROSS THE BORDER.   MEXICO COULD STOP ONE DAY.  WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL. BUT IF MEXICO WANTED, THEY COULD.  DO YOU KNOW HOW TOUGH IT IS TO   BECOME A CITIZEN OF MEXICO?   YOU HAVE A BABY ON THE LAND,   THEN YOU ARE A CITIZEN. CONGRATULATIONS.  TRY THAT IN MEXICO.   THEY LAUGH IN YOUR FACE. I WOULD UNDERSTAND WHY THEY   WOULD WANT PEOPLE TO VOTE   AGAINST ME.   THE PEOPLE OF MEXICO LIKE ME.   IF YOU LOOK AT THE EXIT POLLS   OUT IN NEVADA, WE DO VERY, VERY   WELL WITH THE HISPANICS. GO AHEAD.  HE CALLED ME LAST   WEEK AND COULDN'T HAVE BEEN NICER.  HE WAS -- JUST COULD NOT HAVE   BEEN NICER.   I HAVE TREMENDOUS -- I HAVE   MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BEHIND ME. WE WANT TO BRING CONFIDENCE AND   SANITY BACK TO THIS COUNTRY AND WE WANT TO DO A LOT OF GREAT THINGS AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, THE REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE   EMBRACING -- LOOK, THERE IS SOMETHING HAPPENING WITH OUR   COUNTRY THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED TO THE EXTENT THAT HAS HAPPENED NOW.  MILLIONS OF ADDITIONAL PEOPLE   ARE GOING OUT AND VOTING IN PRIMARIES AND IN THE DEMOCRAT CASE THEY ARE DOWN 35%. NOBODY CARES ABOUT HILLARY AND BERNIE.   WE ARE UP WE'RE UP 72%. SOME STATES ARE UP OVER 100%   AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF ME. NOW, THEY CAN PLAY GAMES AND THEY CAN PLAY CUTE.   I CAN ONLY TAKE HIM AT FACE   VALUE.  I UNDERSTAND DUE POLICITY.  I UNDERSTAND A LOT OF THINGS,   BUT HE CALLED ME LAST WEEK. HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN NICER.   I SPOKE TO MITCH MCCONNELL.   HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN NICER.   IF PEOPLE WANT TO BE SMART,   THEY NEED TO EMBRACE THIS MOVEMENT.  ""TIME"" MAGAZINE CALLED THIS A   MOVEMENT.   IF THEY WANT TO BE SMART.   IF THEY DON'T WANT TO BE SMART,   THEY SHOULD DO WHAT THEY'RE   DOING NOW AND THE REPUBLICANS   WILL GO DOWN TO A MASSIVE LOSS AND ALL OF THESE PEOPLE, THE   MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE   COMING OUT TO VOTE FOR ME --   BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT SOUTH   CAROLINA. I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO WIN SOUTH CAROLINA.   AND I WON IN A LANDSLIDE.   I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO WIN IN   NEVADA. I WON IN A LANDSLIDE. I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO WON MANY  -- I WON IN THE SOUTH.  LOOK AT ALABAMA.  I MEAN, WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO   50% WITH A LOT OF CANDIDATES.   THAT WAS WHEN YOU HAD EVEN MORE   CANDIDATES. SO IF THEY WANT TO EMBRACE   THIS, IT'S GREAT.   LET ME TELL YOU, IF THEY DON'T   WIN, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PROBABLY FOUR AND COULD EVEN BE FIVE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES   APPROVED THAT WILL NEVER ALLOW   THIS COUNTRY TO BE THE SAME. IT WILL TAKE 100 YEARS BUT THAT WON'T WORK.   SO THEY BETTER BE CAREFUL, AND   I CERTAINLY SHOULD BE CAREFUL WITH THIRD PARTY STUFF. IF TRUMP GETS IT WE'RE GOING TO START A THIRD PARTY. THAT MEANS THE DEMOCRATS ARE   GOING TO WIN.   ALMOST CERTAINLY. I MEAN, ONE OF THE -- YOU CAN'T   BE THAT SPITEFUL. YOU CAN'T BE THAT SPITEFUL BECAUSE YOU'LL DESTROY THE COUNTRY.  THIRD PARTY WILL DESTROY THE COUNTRY.  I'M GOING TO BE SUBMITTING A   LIST IN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO --   I'VE ALREADY SHOWN IT TO A LOT   OF PEOPLE. AND, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT WHICH JUDGES. I WANT A -- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE   A CONSERVATIVE, VERY GOOD GROUP OF JUDGES. I'M GOING TO SUBMIT A LIST OF JUSTICES, POTENTIAL JUSTICES OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT   THAT I WILL APPOINT FROM THE   LIST.   I WON'T GO BEYOND THAT LIST. I'M GOING TO LET PEOPLE KNOW BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE SAY, MAYBE I'LL APPOINT A LIBERAL JUDGE.   I'M NOT GOING TO APPOINT A LIBERAL JUDGE.  HERITAGE FOUNDATION AND OTHERS   ARE WORKING ON IT ALREADY. AND WITH SOME THOUGHTS OF MINE  -- I ALREADY NAMED A COUPLE. WE'LL PROBABLY BETWEEN SEVEN AND 10 JUDGES THAT I THINK WILL   MEET THE HIGHEST STANDARDS, THE   HIGHEST STANDARDS AND FROM THAT LIST WE'LL PICK SUPREME COURT JUDGES.   AND I MAKE THAT PLEDGE BECAUSE   I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND,   THAT IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST   PROBLEM -- IT WILL BE TERRIBLE LOSING THE ELECTION BECAUSE THE   COUNTRY'S GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.  BUT IF THE NEW PRESIDENT IS A DEMOCRAT AND PICKS VERY LIBERAL   PEOPLE, THIS COUNTRY IS IN BIG, BIG TROUBLE. OK.   TOM.  GO AHEAD.  I THINK YOU'LL SEE   WHAT HAPPENS.   MAYBE I WON'T.  I HAVE A TEAM.  WE HAVE A VERY GOOD TEAM THAT'S   IN PLACE.   A PROFESSIONAL TEAM. I'LL GIVE YOU NAMES LATER. IT'S A TOP-OF-THE-LINE TEAM. IF HE GETS THE VOTES HE GETS THE VOTES. I THINK WE'LL DO WELL. I THINK WE'LL HAVE A BIG NIGHT   IN ARIZONA AND WE'LL SEE. THAT'S A LOT OF -- LIKE I SAID   WE'LL WIN FLORIDA.  PEOPLE SAY, HOW DO YOU BEAT THE   FACE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY?   DON'T FORGET, I WATCHED YOUR SHOW AND YOU DID A SHOW ON RUBIO.  I HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH HIM.  BUT YOU DID A SHOW FOUR, FIVE   MONTHS AGO ON RUBIO AND YOU   SAID HE'S THE FUTURE OF THE   REPUBLICAN PARTY, HE'S THE   FACE. SO TRUMP WON AGAINST THE FACE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND   BEAT HIM BY 20 POINTS. YOU KNOW, THAT WAS A BIG WIN. AND OUT OF 67 COUNTIES, I WON   66 WHICH IS UNPRECEDENTED. IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.   I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO WELL   IN ARIZONA.   I HOPE TO DO WELL IN WISCONSIN. AND I HOPE TO DO WELL IN A LOT   OF OTHER PLACES BUT I THINK WE CAN PUT IT AWAY.  SURE. I DON'T WANT VIOLENCE.  LET ME JUST TELL YOU, I RENT A STADIUM OR WHATEVER. WE HAD 21,000 PEOPLE NEAR   PHOENIX.  WE HAD 6,000 PEOPLE IN TUCSON OVER THE WEEKEND. AND BOTH OF THEM ON THE SAME   DAY. BOTH WITH VERY SHORT NOTICE. 21,000 PEOPLE AND WE GAVE THEM   SHORT NOTICE.   COUPLE OF DAYS.   THEY BLOCKED THE ROAD.  THESE ARE PROFESSIONAL   AGITATORS. THEY BLOCKED THE ROAD.  THEY USED FOUL LANGUAGE.  THEY PUT UP SIGNS USING THE F   BOMB AND ALL SORTS OF WORDS THAT WERE HORRIBLE.   THESE ARE NOT GOOD PEOPLE.  THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPORTERS ARE UNBELIEVEABLY GOOD PEOPLE. THE GENTLEMAN WHO I UNDERSTAND WAS IN THE AIR FORCE. I HAVEN'T FOUND TOO MUCH ABOUT   IT YET.   I HEAR HE HAD A VERY FINE   RECORD IN THE AIR FORCE.  HE WAS GIVEN A CERTAIN FINGER ON A HAND.  HE WAS TALKED TO HORRIBLY AND   HE WAS ALSO LOOKING AT SOMEBODY THAT CAME UP WITH SOMEBODY   DRESSED AS A MEMBER OF THE   CUCLUX KLAN AND HE HAPPENED TO BE -- KU KLUX KLAN AND HE   HAPPENED TO BE AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN, A SUPPORTER.  IT WAS A SHAME WHAT HAPPENED. HE SAW A MEMBER OF THE KU KLUX   KLAN AND YOU PEOPLE DON'T WRITE   THAT. YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING. IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE AT THE   BEGINNING OF THE NEWS CYCLE EARLIER IN THE MORNING THEY SHOWED THE KU KLUX KLAN GUY   WALKING UP THE STAIRS. AN HOUR OR TWO LATER YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT ANYMORE. YOU JUST SAW THE MAN HITTING. AND I SAID, ISN'T THAT A SHAME? THEY TOOK IT OUT OF THE CYCLE WHICH YOU DID IT -- IT'S TERRIBLE.   THIS IS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN   WHO'S A SUPPORTER, WHO HAS A GREAT FAMILY AND HE HAS HAD ENOUGH.   I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, IN   THIS COUNTRY, ON A LARGER SCALE, THE PEOPLE OF THIS   COUNTRY HAVE HAD ENOUGH.  THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH WHERE WE'RE   LOSING OUR JOBS.  THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH WHERE WE'RE LOSING ALL OUR TRADE. I MEAN, YOU LOOK AT THESE TRADE   DEALS THAT WE HAD.  THEY HAD ENOUGH WHERE OUR   MILITARY CAN'T BEAT ISIS.   THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH WITH THE   INCREASING IN OBAMACARE WHERE   YOU HAVE 35%, 45%, 55%   INCREASES IN OBAMACARE AND YOUR   DEDUCTIBLE IS SO HIGH YOU CAN'T   EVEN USE IT.  IT REALLY ESSENTIALLY ISN'T   HEALTH INSURANCE. PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE FED   UP. OK.   MARK, GO AHEAD.  YOU KNOW, HONESTLY,   MARK, I DON'T SEE THREATS.  YOU HAVE PEOPLE GOING AGAINST   YOU, THAT HAPPENS IN LIFE   WHETHER IN POLITICS OR NOT.   I THINK THEY'RE MISGUIDED.  I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT GO   AGAINST ME SHOULD EMBRACE ME AND I'D EMBRACE THEM VERY   EASILY. THEY SHOULD EMBRACE ME BECAUSE  -- YOU REPORTED ON IT.  THEY HAVE SAID IN YOUR CIRCLES, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AN EVENT LIKE THAT -- LIKE WHAT WE'RE   DOING THROUGH IN THE HISTORY OF   POLITICS. I'VE HAD PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW VERY WELL SAY IN THE HISTORY OF   POLITICS. WE HAVE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD   THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IT AND TO   BE HONEST WITH YOU, MARK, THEY   SHOULD EMBRACE IT.  BUT THEY DON'T SO THAT WOULD BE   A THREAT.   IF THEY DON'T EMBRACE IT THAT'S ALWAYS A THREAT.  YEAH. GO AHEAD, SIR.  LOOK, AGAIN, JEFF   SESSIONS AND OTHERS HAVE ENDORSED ME.  WE HAVE GREAT CONGRESSMAN. I WATCH THEM ON TELEVISION A   LOT.  THEY ENDORSE ME.  I DO WANT TO SAY THIS.  I DON'T WANT TO DRIVE YOU FOLKS CRAZY.  PEOPLE THAT ARE WATCHING THAT   ARE AGAINST ME AREN'T REALLY AGAINST ME BECAUSE THEY'RE CALLING ME.   I'VE SEEN PEOPLE ON TELEVISION,   WE HAVE TO STOP DONALD TRUMP,   WE HAVE TO STOP AND THEY'RE ON   THE PHONE WITH ME AN HOUR AND A   HALF BEFORE AND THEY WANT TO   SET UP A MEETING. YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT YOU THINK ARE AGAINST ME AND IT'S JUST POLITICIANS.  THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL.   THEY WANT TO COME IN AND THEY   WANT TO BE PART OF IT. PEOPLE REALLY DO WANT TO BE PART OF IT.  THEY HAVE TO EMBRACE WHAT'S HAPPENING. WE HAVE PEOPLE, MANY DEMOCRATS   ARE COMING OVER.  THIS IS WHY WE'RE GOING TO BEAT   HILLARY CLINTON. IF I'M RUNNING IT I'M GOING TO   BEAT HER. WE HAVE DEMOCRATS COMING IN. I MEAN, WE HAVE, MARK, 20% OF   THE DEMOCRATS COME IN FOR THE   LAST PRIMARY. 20% WERE DEMOCRATS.   BUT WE HAVE INDEPENDENTS COMING   IN VAST NUMBERS. AND THE MOST AMAZING THING, WE   HAVE MANY, MANY PEOPLE.   YOU WOULDN'T THINK THERE WERE THIS MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER   VOTED BEFORE.   THEY'VE NEVER VOTED BEFORE, SARAH.  YOU KNOW THAT.  I SEE IT WHEN I'M DOING THE   ROPE LINES OR SIGNINGS OR SHAKING OF THE HAND.  THEY SAY, MR. TRUMP, I HAVE NEVER, EVER VOTED.  WE ARE TALKING ABOUT   30-YEAR-OLD MEN.  40-YEAR-OLD WOMEN. MY OLDEST IS 93 YEARS OLD FROM TENNESSEE.  SHE'S NEVER VOTED BEFORE. THIS INCREDIBLE WOMAN. I ACTUALLY INTERVIEWED HER A   COUPLE OF -- AND SHE'S SO   EXCITED. AND SHE'S GOING TO BE VOTING. 93 YEARS OLD FROM TENNESSEE.  SO I JUST TELL YOU THAT THERE'S   SOMETHING THAT'S AMAZING THAT'S   HAPPENING. THE OTHER THING IS WE'RE GOING   TO GET STATES THAT OTHER   REPUBLICANS CAN NEVER EVEN   THINK OF LIKE MICHIGAN.   MICHIGAN'S NOT IN THE ROAD OF, YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK AT IT. OHIO IS A STATE WE HAVE TO WIN,   RIGHT? YOU HAVE TO WIN FLORIDA.  YOU HAVE TO WIN VIRGINIA.   YOU HAVE TO WIN PENNSYLVANIA.   THEY DON'T EVER TALK ABOUT   MICHIGAN BECAUSE THEY SAY YOU   CAN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. I THINK WE HAVE A SHOT AT NEW   YORK. NEW YORK VALUES.  REMEMBER NEW YORK VALUES.   DO YOU THINK TED CRUZ WILL WIN   NEW YORK?   I DON'T THINK SO.   IF YOU WIN NEW YORK IT'S OVER   BECAUSE IT'S GOT SO MANY DEL COMBATES.   SO I THINK WE HAVE A CHANCE AT   WINNING NEW YORK AND VARIOUS OTHER STATES WE'RE GOING TO WIN THAT NOBODY ELSE CAN WIN. THAT MAKES IT A WHOLE DIFFERENT CONTEST.  BUT THINK IN TERMS OF MICHIGAN.   I WON MICHIGAN REALLY BIG.  DON'T FORGET KASICH WAS OUT IN   MICHIGAN.   HE STAYED THERE.  HE SLEPT THERE. HE ACTUALLY MADE THE STATEMENT THAT IF HE DOESN'T WIN MICHIGAN   HE'S GOING TO LEAVE THE RACE.   HE WAS SO SURE OF MICHIGAN AND   HE LOST MICHIGAN IN A LANDSLIDE TO ME.  SO I'M GOING TO WIN MICHIGAN   AND I'M GOING TO WIN OTHER STATES THAT NO OTHER REPUBLICAN   CANDIDATE CAN WIN.  THAT FROM THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE STANDPOINT THROWS THIS THING   MUCH -- IT MAKES IT A MUCH BIGGER DEAL.  OK. ONE OR TWO MORE.  I DON'T DENOUNCE THE   COUNTRY.  I WANT THEM TO PAY US SOME MONEY.  I THINK ISRAEL WILL DO THAT ALSO, YEAH. THERE ARE MANY COUNTRIES THAT   CAN PAY AND THEY CAN PAY BIG. WE'RE SUPPORTING SOUTH KOREA. I ORDER THOUSANDS OF TELEVISION SETS FROM SOUTH KOREA. THEY'RE A BEHEMOTH ECONOMICALLY.   EVERY TIME NORTH KOREA RAISES ITS HEAD THEY DO ANYTHING, THEY   SNEEZE. WE START SENDING THE SHIPS, THE   PLANES, ANYTHING ELSE.  WE DON'T GET PROPER REIMBURSEMENT FOR THAT.   NOW, I LIKE SOUTH KOREA. I HAVE PROPERTY IN SOUTH KOREA.   I LIKE IT.  I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS IN SOUTH KOREA. THEY CAN'T BELIEVE THEY GET   AWAY WITH IT, TO BE HONEST.   GERMANY CAN'T BELIEVE IT. YOU KNOW WHO REALLY CAN'T   BELIEVE IT? SAUDI ARABIA. WE HAVE SAUDI ARABIA, THE RICHEST COUNTRY NO MATTER HOW   YOU CUT IT, THEY WERE MAKING -- I TELL THIS. UNTIL RECENTLY BUT NOW THEY'RE MAKING HALF WHICH IS STILL --   THEY WERE MAKING $1 BILLION A DAY.  AND WE SUBSIDIZED THE MILITARY.   IT'S RIDICULOUS.  IT'S RIDICULOUS.  AND THEY WOULDN'T BE THERE   EXCEPT FOR US.  THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET   OUR WEALTH BACK.  THIS AND OTHER THINGS, TRADE DEALS.  OK.   ONE MORE QUESTION.  ONE MORE. WHO'S GOT A GOOD QUESTION?  WHO'S GOT A GOOD QUESTION?  WHO'S MY FAVORITE REPORTER?   GO AHEAD.  SURE.  I WANT A BETTER RELATIONSHIP   WITH EVERYBODY.   YEAH.   I WANT A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA.  NO, I DON'T THINK SO.   PUTIN SAYS VERY NICE THINGS   ABOUT ME.   I THINK THAT'S VERY NICE.   IT HAS NO EFFECT ON ME OTHER   THAN I THINK IT'S VERY NICE.  IF WE CAN GET ALONG WITH   RUSSIA, THAT'S VERY GOOD.   IF RUSSIA WANTS TO SPEND   MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A DAY   DROPPING BOMBS ON ISIS, I'M OK WITH THAT.  YOU KNOW, I'M OK WITH THAT.   SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT. THEY SAY, NO, IT'S OUR JOB.   LET RUSSIA IF THEY WANT DO DO   THAT I'M ALL FOR IT.  NO, I WANT TO GET ALONG WITH   ALL COUNTRIES.  AND WE WILL.  WE WILL HAVE MUCH BETTER -- YOU LOOK AT WHAT CHINA IS DOING IN   THE SOUTH CHINA SEA. THAT'S SO VERY DISRESPECTFUL TO OBAMA AND TO OUR COUNTRY.   YOU TAKE A LOOK WHAT THEY'RE   DOING IN THE SOUTH. THEY'RE BUILDING A MASSIVE MILITARY COMPLEX. AND YET THEY'RE DRAINING US FOR   MONEY. THEY'RE TAKING MONEY OUT OF OUR   COUNTRY WHERE WE'RE BUILDING -- WE ARE REBUILDING CHINA.  SO, NO, I WANT TO GET ALONG WITH ALL COUNTRIES. AND YOU KNOW, THE INTERESTING   THING WE'LL DO MUCH BETTER WITH ALL COUNTRIES AND YET WE'LL GET   ALONG WITH THEM BETTER TOO. OK.   GO AHEAD. REAL FAST.  GO AHEAD. REPORTER:   THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT   SUPPORTING TRUMP WANT TO SUPPORT ME.    A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL   JOIN THE TEAM OR AS THEY SAY THE TRUMP TRAIN. BUT A LOT OF THEM -- I JUST DON'T WANT TO DO IT NOW. BUT YOU'LL SEE OVER THE NEXT SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.   I MEAN, MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT I WATCH ON TELEVISION THAT ARE   SUPPORTING SOMEBODY ELSE ARE   REALLY SUPPORTING ME OR THEY   WANT TO AND THEY WILL AS SOON   AS WE SAY YES.  BUT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE. OK.  WE'LL LOOK AT THAT.  WE'LL LOOK AT PRO-LIFE.   WE'LL LOOK AT THAT. WE'LL LOOK AT INTELLECT. VERY IMPORTANT.   LIKE WE WANT VERY, VERY SMART   PEOPLE.   WE WANT CONSERVATIVES ON THE   SUPREME COURT BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING UP A LIST FROM SEVEN TO 10 PEOPLE.   I WILL BE DISTRIBUTING THAT   LIST IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE.   OK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  LET'S TAKE A TOUR.  NOBODY ASKED ABOUT THE HOTEL.   DOES ANYBODY WANT TO SEE --   FIRST OF ALL, THIS ROOM -- DOES ANYBODY WANT TO SEE WHAT WE'RE BUILDING NOW? THE LARGEST LUXURY BALLROOM IN WASHINGTON BY FAR, WE COULD   TAKE A LOOK.  THEN IF ANYBODY WANTS TO GO UP   AT THE ROOMS AND SUITES, THEY'RE GIVING SOME TOURS.  THEY ARE MAGNIFICENT.   THE BUILDING WAS GUTTED DOWN TO THE BASICS.   IT WAS GUTTED DOWN TO THE STEEL EXCEPT FOR THIS AREA BECAUSE THIS AREA IS ALL A LANDMARK AND WE HAVE MAGNIFICENT SUITES, ROOMS, MEETING ROOMS AND WE'RE   BUILDING A BALLROOM. IF YOU FOLLOW ME I'LL GIVE YOU A TOUR OF THE BALLROOM. COME ON, MARK. COME ON.  FOLLOW ME.   ",Donald Trump News Conference

WHOA! OH, THANK YOU, FOLKS. THANK YOU YOU VERY MUCH, FOLKS. OH, WHAT A CROWD THIS IS! THANK YOU ALL, VERY MUCH. SHERIFF JOE, I WANT TO THANK  YOU. YOU HAVE SOME SHERIFF. THERE ARE NO GAMES WITH THIS SHERIFF, THAT'S FOR SURE. AND JAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH, AND JEFF, BOY OH BOY, WE HAVE SO MUCH SUPPORT, AND ON TUESDAY, WE'VE GOT TO MAKE THAT MOVEMENT  GO FORWARD. THE ESTABLISHMENT, THEY DON'T  KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.  THEY HAVE NO CLUE. THEY DON'T HOW TO WIN. THEY PICK THE PEOPLE THAT ABSOLUTELY WILL NEVER WIN WITH  THE PEOPLE THEY TALK ABOUT. GO OUT ON TUESDAY AND VOTE, I  WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN.   AND I WANT TO TELL  YOU, YOU KNOW, SO MUCH ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND SO MUCH HAS BEEN MENTIONED ABOUT IT AND  TALKED ABOUT IT AND THESE POLITICIANS ARE ALL TALK, NO ACTION, THEY ARE NEVER GOING TO DO ANYTHING, AND THEY ARE ONLY GOING TO PICK THIS UP BECAUSE  WHEN I WENT AND I ANNOUNCED THAT  I WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, I  SAID, YOU KNOW, HIS COUNTRY IS A  BIG, BIG PROBLEM WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT IT, AND THEN WE HAD BAD THINGS  HAPPENING, AND THERE WAS CRIME AND YOU HAD SO MANY KILLINGS AND  SO MUCH CRIME. DRUGS WERE POURING THROUGH THE BORDER, PEOPLE ARE NOW SEEING IT, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL AND  WE ARE GOING TO STOP IT.  IT'S GOING TO END.   I ONLY WISH THESE CAMERAS -- BECAUSE THERE IS  NOTHING AS DISHONEST AS THE  MEDIA, THAT I CAN TELL YOU. I ONLY WISH THESE CAMERAMEN WOULD SPIN AROUND AND SHOW THE  KIND OF PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE. THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE HERE. I JUST WISH THAT FOR ONCE, THEY  WOULD DO IT, BECAUSE YOU KNOW  WHAT? WE HAVE A SILENT MAJORITY THAT  IS NO LONGER SO SILENT. IT IS NOW THE LOUD, NOISY  MINORITY, AND WE ARE GOING TO BE  HEARD.  WE ARE GOING TO BE HEARD. SO TODAY, ONE OF THE VERY BIG STORIES WAS ABOUT THE BORDER  AGENTS, THEY SAY THEY SUPPORT  TRUMP, THAT TRUMP IS THE ONLY  ONE RUNNING THAT HAS THEIR BACKS, OK?  AND THEY CAN DO THE JOB, BUT  THEY DON'T GET SUPPORT FROM THE  POLITICIANS.  NOW WHY? I AM STILL FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN,  I AM PUTTING UP MY OWN MONEY, AND THESE GUYS, I LOOK AT THEM  ALL UP AND DOWN, WE STARTED WITH 17 AND NOW WE ARE DOWN TO THREE. DON'T WE LOVE THAT? DON'T WE LOVE IT? DON'T WE LOVE THAT? WE LOST THE FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY LAST TUESDAY IN FLORIDA, YOU KNOW, HE WAS THE FUTURE, HE WAS THE FUTURE OF THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY, EXCEPT I WON FLORIDA IN A LANDSLIDE BECAUSE  PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF WHAT POLITICIANS ARE DOING TO THE COUNTRY, REMEMBER THAT.  THEY ARE TIRED OF IT. THEY ARE SICK AND TIRED OF IT.  REMEMBER OBAMA? CHANGE! THIS IS GOING TO BE REAL CHANGE AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A BORDER AND UNLESS YOU HAVE A  BORDER, YOU DON'T HAVE A  COUNTRY, FOLKS, YOU DON'T HAVE A  COUNTRY.  REMEMBER THAT. NOW IT, IN ADDITION, AND WE WILL  GO THROUGH A LIST OF THINGS VERY  QUICKLY, BECAUSE FRANKLY, IT  DOESN'T TAKE A LONG TIME, WE ARE  GOING TO END, AND CORE, EDUCATION WILL BE LOCAL. EVERYBODY WANTS IT. WE DON'T WANT OUR CHILDREN  EDUCATED BY BUREAUCRATS FROM  WASHINGTON, D.C., SO WE AND  COMMON CORE EDUCATION LOCAL. WE'RE GOING TO TERMINATE  OBAMACARE. WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL IT AND  REPLACE IT WITH GREAT HEALTH  CARE FOR FAR LESS MONEY. THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. REMEMBER, IT IS A PERCEIVED --  IT IS UNDER SIEGE LIKE NEVER  BEFORE AND WE ARE GOING TO  PROTECT IT. YOU KNOW, IN PARIS, THEY HAVE THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE  WORLD, THE WORLD, NO TOUGHER GUN  LAWS THAN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, TOUGH.  AND GUESS WHAT? 130 PEOPLE DEAD, AND NO BULLETS  GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  THE SAME THING HAPPENED IN  CALIFORNIA. 14 PEOPLE. RADICALIZE PEOPLE.  SHE PROBABLY RADICALIZED HIM.  THEY WENT IN AND KILLED PEOPLE THAT THEY WORKED WITH, THAT THEY  SUPPOSEDLY LIKED.  IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN  ANYMORE, FOLKS. IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. WE ARE GOING TO BE SMART, WE ARE  GOING TO BE VIGILANT, WE ARE  GOING TO BE SMART PEOPLE, WE ARE  GOING TO BE PROUD OF OUR COUNTRY  AGAIN. OUR MILITARY IS DEPLETED. OUR MILITARY IS EXHAUSTED. WE DON'T REPLENISH. WE TAKE, WE DON'T REPLENISH. WE SEND THE BEST EQUIPMENT IN  THE WORLD OVER TO WHEREVER WE  ARE SENDING IT.  WE DON'T EVEN KNOW. I DON'T EVEN THINK WE KNOW WHERE  WE ARE SENDING IT. AND A BULLITT GETS FIRED IN THE AIR AND THE ENEMY TAKES OVER  THIS GREAT EQUIPMENT AND THEN THEY HAVE BETTER EQUIPMENT THAN WE DO AND THEY ARE USING OUR EQUIPMENT.  THOSE DAYS ARE DONE. THOSE DAYS ARE DONE.   WE ARE GOING TO  REBUILD OUR MILITARY. IT IS GOING TO BE BIGGER,  BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER,  AND HOPEFULLY NOBODY, NOBODY WILL HAVE TO USE IT. NOBODY, AND I MEAN NOBODY, IS  GOING TO MESS WITH US ANYMORE.  I LOVE YOU, TOO.  I LOVE YOU, TOO. I HAVE SUCH A SOFT SPOT FOR THIS COUNTRY. IN ALABAMA, WE HAD 35,000 PEOPLE, OKLAHOMA, NO MATTER  WHERE WE GO, WE HAVE THESE  MASSIVE CROWDS. AND BY THE WAY, ARE WE WINNING  OR WHAT? LOOK AT THE NUMBERS! YOU KNOW IT IS REALLY, IT IS  REALLY AMAZING, YOU KNOW TO ME,  IT IS REALLY AMAZING. WE HAVE WON 20 STATES, AND WE  HAVE ONE IN MASSIVE LANDSLIDES - - HAVE WON IN MASSIVE LANDSLIDES. IA WON IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, I  WASN'T SUPPOSED TO WIN IN NEW  HAMPSHIRE, AND TED CRUZ, HE  WASN'T BORN IN THIS COUNTRY, FOLKS, AND HE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE IN THIS COUNTRY, AND HE  SHOULDN'T BE IN THIS GROUP THAT  WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. BUT WE WIN IN A MASSIVE  LANDSLIDE, AND WE GO TO SOUTH  CAROLINA WERE WE HAVE THE  EVANGELICALS. 68%. LYIN' TED, WE CALL HIM LYIN'  TED. SO HE COMES UP WITH A BIBLE AND HE PUTS IT DOWN AND YOU KNOW WHAT? HE STARTS LINE.  AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THE EVANGELICALS DON'T LIKE  LIARS. THAT WAS GOING TO BE AN EASY VICTORY AND TRUMP WINS IT IN A  LANDSLIDE. IN A LANDSLIDE. AND THEN ONE AFTER ANOTHER, WE GO AND WE WIN IN NEVADA, A LANDSLIDE, WE WIN IN THE SEC, WE DID SO GREAT, AND WE HAD A GREAT  DAY ON TUESDAY. WE HAD 5, 5. AND THAT I HEARD TED CRUZ THE  OTHER DAY, SAYING, I AM THE ONLY  ONE WHO CAN STOP TRUMP, I AM THE ONLY ONE. DO YOU EVER HEAR THIS GUY? AND HE SAID, I BEAT HIM FIVE  TIMES, AND I THOUGHT, WAIT A  MINUTE, I BEAT HIM 20 TIMES. LYIN' TED, LYIN' TED. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I WILL TELL YOU, JOHN KASICH IS A NICE GUY, BUT HE IS DONE.  AS FAR AS ARIZONA IS CONCERNED,  JOHN KASICH IS VERY, VERY WEAK  AS YOU KNOW. AND ANOTHER THING THAT I DON'T  LIKE, HE APPROVED NAFTA. WHEN YOU APPROVE NAFTA, A LOT OF  YOUR BUSINESSES HAD LEFT. HE IS ALSO IN FAVOR OF TPP, AND SO, BY THE WAY, IS TED CRUZ. TPP IS A DISASTER. TPP IS THE TRANSPACIFIC  PARTNERSHIP, IT IS A DISASTER,  IT IS GOING TO TAKE AWAY THE  AUTO INDUSTRY, IT IS A DISASTER,  YOU DON'T WANT IT. YOU DON'T DO TRADE WITH MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF COUNTRIES, FOLKS, YOU  DO IT ONE AT A TIME, ONE AT A TIME, ONE AT A TIME.  IF THEY DON'T COOPERATE, THEN  YOU PUT THEM IN THE SHED, AND  THEN MAYBE WE LET THEM COME  BACK. YOU KNOW, I BUILT A GREAT  COMPANY, A MASSIVE COMPANY, A FANTASTIC COMPANY, AND I FILED,  I DID MY FILINGS, AND OH, THEY  WERE SO UNHAPPY WITH IT.  IT IS A GOOD COMPANY, IT IS A PHENOMENAL COMP VERYANY, LITTLE DEBT, A LOT OF CASH FLOW. -- IT IS A PHENOMENAL COMPANY, VERY LITTLE DEBT, A LOT OF CASH FLOW.  I SAY THIS NOT TO BRAG, BUT TO  SHOW YOU THAT WE NEED THIS. WE HAVE $19 TRILLION IN DEBT, $19 TRILLION. WHO EVEN KNOWS WHAT ONE TRILLION  IS? WE HAVE $19 TRILLION IN DEBT, GOING TO $21 TRILLION, AND THEY JUST APPROVED IN THE CONGRESS A BUDGET, IT IS A DISASTER, THEY CALL IT THE OMNIBUS, THE OMNIBUS, IT IS A DISASTER, OBAMACARE IS A DISASTER, THERE ARE PEOPLE COMING INTO THE  UNITED STATES, WE HAVE NO IDEA  WHO THEY ARE, AND IT FUNDS THE  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COMING IN,  THEY COME RIGHT THROUGH ARIZONA. ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE FUNDED  WITH A BUDGET THAT THEY  APPROVED, AND I THINK IT TOOK THEM, LIKE, 12 MINUTES TO  APPROVE THE BUDGET. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE,  FOLKS, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. SO HERE IS STORY, BOTTOM LINE, THE BOTTOM LINE. IT IS, FIRST OF ALL, IT IS GREAT  TO BE WITH YOU. THIS IS INCREDIBLE. WE EXPECTED, AND THIS WAS JUST SET UP RESULT, AND WE EXPECTED -- AND BY THE WAY, I DON'T KNOW  IF YOU KNOW, LAST NIGHT WE HAD AN UNBELIEVABLE EVENING IN SALT  LAKE CITY, UTAH, AND I HOPE THEY  GO WITH US, I HOPE THEY GO WITH  US. I SAID WE HAVE TO STOP THERE, I  STOPPED, AND WE HAD AN AMAZING  EVENING THERE. BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT THE WAY THAT I FINISHED, IT IS SIMPLE, OUR COUNTRY IS NOT  WINNING ANYMORE.  OUR TRADE IS A DISASTER. CHINA, WHAT CHINA HAS DONE TO  HER COUNTRY, CHINA HAS BEEN  REBUILT BECAUSE OF THE MONEY AND THE JOBS WE HAVE LOST AND THE  MONEY WE HAVE GIVEN THEM.  WE HAVE REBUILD CHINA AND THEY  KNOW IT.  I HAVE MANY FRIENDS FROM CHINA. I DON'T HAVE ANY OBJECTION TO CHINA, I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL, I  AM ANGRY AT OUR PEOPLE, NOT  THEIR PEOPLE, IF YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH IT. SO LOOK, WE'VE REBUILD CHINA. IT IS NOT FREE TRADE, IT IS NOT ANYTHING, THIS IS HORRIBLE, STUPID TRADE. WHEN YOU HAVE $500 BILLION A YEAR, FOLKS, WE'VE GOT TO GET  SMART. I HAVE CARL ICON, I HAVE THE  GREATEST NEGOTIATORS IN THE  WORLD, -- CARL ICHAHN, I HAVE  THE GREATEST NEGOTIATORS IN THE  WORLD. WE HAD PFIZER, A GREAT COMPANY, PFIZER, THEY JUST ANNOUNCED THEY ARE LEAVING.  THEY ARE A HUGE DRUG COMPANY. THEY ANNOUNCED THEY ARE GOING TO IRELAND. COMPANIES ARE GOING TO MEXICO.  NABISCO, FORD, WHERE ARE THEY  GOING? MEXICO.  MEXICO, MARK MY WORDS, EXIT CODE IS A SMALL VERSION OF CHINA.  WE BETTER GET SMART AND WE  BETTER GET SMART QUICKLY --  MEXICO, MARK MY WORDS, MEXICO IS  A SMALL VERSION OF CHINA. WE BETTER GET SMART AND WE  BETTER GET SMART QUICKLY. MY DAUGHTER, IVANKA, SHE TOLD ME TO ACT PRESIDENTIAL, ACT  PRESIDENTIAL. SHE SAID, IN THE NEXT DEBATE,  ACT PRESIDENTIAL. I DIDN'T ATTACK MARCO, I DIDN'T ATTACK LITTLE MARKO, AND I DIDN'T ATTACK TED, LYIN' TED, LYIN' TED. BUT TED CRUZ, HE IS NOT GOING TO  BE THE RIGHT GUY, HE IS NOT  GOING ANYWHERE, SO IT IS NOT  GOING TO HAPPEN. I SAY WE MAKE IS BEFORE THE  CONVENTION, BY THE WAY. YOU HAVE THESE STIFFS LIKE MITT ROMNEY.  THE GUY IS A TOTAL STIFF. DID HE LET US DOWN? THIS GUY IS A LOSER. DID HE LET US DOWN? I MEAN, HERE IS A GUY, HE GOES UP, HE IS SO DEVASTATED, HE FORGOT THE CAMPAIGN IN THE FINAL  MONTH, HE GAVE IT TO OBAMA. THE LEAVE ME, I AM GOING TO WIN,  I AM GOING TO BE HILLARY, BUT LET ME TELL YOU, BEATING OBAMA  FOUR YEARS AGO WAS EASIER THAN  BEATING HILLARY CLINTON NOW, BELIEVE ME.  AND MITT ROMNEY CHOKED. PURE AND SIMPLE. HE CHOKED, HE CHOKED LIKE A DOG, AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THAT'S NOT GOOD TO HAPPEN WITH  ME. SO HERE'S THE STORY.  HERE'S THE STORY. COME ON BACK, FOLKS. COME ON BACK. YOU LEFT. WE HAD INCOMPETENT LEADERSHIP.  YOU LEFT. SOME FOLKS SAID, WE ARE NOT  COMING BACK, WE HAD INCOMPETENT  LEADERSHIP, BUT NOW WE CAN BRING YOU BACK.  YOU WENT TO MEXICO, WILL BRING  YOU BACK. BUT I'M A CONSERVATIVE, AND I AM SMART, AND LOOK, I SPENT $48  MILLION IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, -- JEB SPENT $48 MILLION IN NEW  HAMPSHIRE, AND I SPENT SOME  MONEY, TOO, MY OWN MONEY, BUT I WON. HE IS A JOKE. PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO CLUE ABOUT MONEY OR DEALS THAT HAVE NOT  READ ""THE ART OF THE DEAL"" IN ALL FAIRNESS, IT IS NOT OF INTEREST TO THEM.  LOOK AT JOHN KERRY. LOOK AT THE DEAL HE MADE WITH IRAN. ONE OF THE WORST DEALS EVER NEGOTIATED. ONE OF THE WORST DEALS EVER NEGOTIATED. LOOK AT IT, IT IS A DISGRACE, IT IS AN EMBARRASSMENT. BY THE WAY, ON THAT DEAL, WE  SHOULD HAVE NEVER, EVER, EVEN STARTED, UNTIL WE GOT THOSE PRISONERS BACK, WE SHOULD HAVE  GOTTEN THEM BACK YEARS AGO, AND ONCE WE GOT THEM BACK, WE SHOULD HAVE TOLD THEM, BY THE WAY, THE $150 BILLION, NO, WE ARE A DEBTOR'S NATION, FOLKS. AFTER ABOUT TWO DAYS OF TURMOIL,  WE WOULD HAVE SAVED, BELIEVE ME, 150 BILLION DOLLARS. THAT DEAL IS SUCH AN EMBARRASSMENT.  WELL, OUR TRADE DEALS ARE JUST  LIKE THAT. OUR TRAINED DEALS ARE JUST LIKE  THAT. BOWE BERGDAHL, HE IS JUST LIKE  THAT. BERGDAHL, HE IS A TRAITOR.  WE GET BERGDAHL, AND WE GET TO GIVE THEM FIVE OF THE GREAT KILLERS THAT THEY HAVE COVETED. THOSE GUYS ARE NOW BACK ON THE  BATTLEFIELD, TRYING TO KILL US  ALL, AND WE'VE GOT A TRAITOR.  BIG DEAL. AND BY THE WAY, A TRAITOR THAT  HAS SUPPOSEDLY, SUPPOSEDLY, FIVE  OR SIX YOUNG BEAUTIFUL SOLDIERS  WERE KILLED TRYING TO GET HIM  BACK.  THAT IS OUR DEAL. THAT IS THE WAY WE NEGOTIATE. THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN  ANYMORE. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE. SO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS WE  ARE GOING TO TELL OUR WONDERFUL BUSINESSES THAT DESERTED US, THEY LEFT US, AND I'M NOT EVEN  BLAMING THEM, THEY HAD NO REASON  NOT TO, BECAUSE NOBODY TALKS -- YOU THINK SOMEBODY WENT TO CARRY  HER AND SAID, YOU LISTEN COMING  YOU LET ALL OF THESE PEOPLE GO,  DON'T GO TO MEXICO? THEY DON'T DO THAT. SO THEY MOVE INTO MEXICO, AND I  WOULD SAY, AND I WOULD DO IT  MYSELF, I KNOW IT IS NOT PRESIDENTIAL, IT IS NOT PRESIDENTIAL, IT IS NOT  PRESIDENTIAL OF THE PRESIDENT OF  THE UNITED STATES TO CALL UP THE  PRESIDENT OF CARRIER, ""HELLO,  THIS IS THE PRESIDENT."" BUT THIS IS SO MUCH FUN FOR ME. PLEASE, DON'T TAKE THAT AWAY. DON'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME. I LOVE DEALS.  SO WHETHER IT IS ONE OF ME OR  ONE OF MY REPRESENTATIVE'S, I  KNOW THE GOOD ONES, I KNOW THE BAD ONES, THAT WHETHER IT IS ONE  OF THESE KILLERS OR ONE OF SOME REAL FOR ME, PLEASE, LET ME DO IT. LET HE DO IT, PLEASE. SO I CALL UP, AND THEY WOULD  SAY, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES IS CALLING THE PRESIDENT  OF CARRIER, GET THEM ON THE PHONE, I WOULD SAY, ""GOOD LUCK IN MEXICO, ENJOY YOUR STAY, BUT  HERE IS THE STORY, YOU LET GO OF  14,000 PEOPLE THAT HELPED TO BUILD YOUR COMPANY, AND I REALLY LOVE, BY THE WAY, I REALLY LOVE  THE NEW PICTURES OF YOUR FACILITY. EVERY SINGLE AIR CONDITIONING UNIT THAT YOU MAKE, EVERY SINGLE ONE, AS IT CROSSES THE BORDER, AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A REAL BORDER, BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO  HAVE A WALL, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A REAL BORDER, WE ARE GOING  TO HAVE A DATE, BEAUTIFUL WALL  THAT NOBODY IS CROSSING, JUST IN  CASE YOU HAD ANY QUESTIONS, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE TUNNELS AND STUFF, NOBODY IS GOING OVER  IT AND NOBODY IS GOING OVER IT  AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A BIG, BEAUTIFUL DOOR, BUT PEOPLE ARE  GOING TO BE COMING INTO OUR  COUNTRY LEGALLY, LEGALLY,  LEGALLY, SO I TELL THE HEAD OF CARRIER, EVERYTHING WILL UNIT THAT YOU MAKE IN MEXICO AND THAT YOU SELL IN THE UNITED STATES,  WE ARE GOING TO PUT A 35% TAX ON  THAT UNIT, AND I HOPE IT WORKS  OUT WELL FOR YOU."" AND HERE IS WHAT IS GOING TO  HAPPEN, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE LOBBYISTS CALL ME, BUT I DIDN'T  TAKE ANY MONEY, THEY ARE GOING  TO HAVE SPECIAL INTEREST, AND, AND I DIDN'T TAKE ANY MONEY, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE DONORS, DONORS, DONORS, BUT I DIDN'T  TAKE ANY MONEY, I DON'T GIVE A DAMN FOR THEM, FOLKS.  I CARE ABOUT YOU. AND HERE IS WHAT IS GOING TO  HAPPEN. WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THAT PHONE CALL, AHEAD OF CARRIER AND FORD AND SO MANY OTHER COMPANIES, I  MEAN, YOU JUST TAKE A LOOK, I  COULD GIVE YOU A LIST AND YOU  COULD READ THEM ALL DAY, THE  HEAD OF NABISCO, LEAVING CHICAGO WITH THEIR PLANT, THEY ARE  HEADED TO MEXICO, NO MORE OREOS FOR US, NO MORE OREOS TO EAT. SO HERE IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, FOLKS, I WILL GET A CALL WITHIN 24 HOURS, A PRESIDENT OF CARRIER, ""MR. PRESIDENT, WE HAVE  DECIDED TO STAY IN THE UNITED STATES."" AND THEN I WOULD SAY, ""THANK YOU  VERY MUCH. AND I DON'T WANT IT IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA, OR ANYWHERE IN  PARTICULAR, WE JUST WANT IT IN  THE UNITED STATES."" THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN A LOT.  WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE. WE DON'T WIN AT ANYTHING.  WE DON'T WIN AT ANYTHING. WE DON'T WIN AT ANYTHING.  WE ARE GOING TO BEAT ISIS. HOW ABOUT GENERAL GEORGE PATTON? HE IS TOO TOUGH. HE IS TOO TOUGH. HE COULDN'T BE A GENERAL ANYMORE BECAUSE HE IS TOO TOUGH.  HE IS NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT. BY THE WAY, CHIPPING AWAY, JUST  LIKE I SAID, CHIPPING AWAY AT  THE SECOND AMENDMENT, THEY ARE  CHIPPING AWAY AT CHRISTIANITY,  THEY ARE CHIPPING AWAY AT OUR RELIGION, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE IT ANYMORE. WHEN IT COMES TO CHRISTMAS TIME,  THEY ARE GOING TO PUT UP A FIGHT, BUT WE ARE GOING TO PUT  UP A SIGN AS IS, -- SIGN  THAT SAYS, ""MERRY, MERRY, MERRY  CHRISTMAS!"" WE ARE TOTALLY IMPOTENT AS A  COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO KNOCK THE HELL  OUT OF CRISIS AND WE ARE GOING  TO REBUILD OUR COUNTRY, WE ARE  GOING TO REBUILD -- OUT OF ISIS,  AND WE ARE GOING TO REBUILD OUR  COUNTRY. WE'RE GOING TO REBUILD OUR COUNTRY. OUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE SO  STRONG. SOMEBODY AT THAT COMPANY THAT  STOLE THE EQUIPMENT HAD  POLITICAL CONNECTIONS TO THESE  CHARACTERS THAT I RUN AGAINST.  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT  MILITARY AND WE ARE GOING TO FINALLY, FINALLY TAKE CARE OF  OUR GREAT VETERANS, WE'RE GOING  TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. SO WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH THE MILITARY, WE ARE GOING TO WIN. OH, THANK YOU, LOOK AT YOU. LOOK AT YOU. USA IS RIGHT. USA.  SO, FOLKS, WE ARE  GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH OUR MILITARY, WE ARE GOING TO WIN  FOR OUR VETS, WE'RE GOING TO WIN  FOR OUR VETS, RIGHT? WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOR OUR  VETS, WE'RE GOING TO WIN WITH OUR MILITARY, WE ARE GOING TO  WIN WITH A OBAMACARE, WE ARE  GOING TO GET RID OF IT AND GOING  TO MAKE SOMETHING MUCH BETTER, WE'RE GOING TO WIN WITH EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES. WE'RE GOING TO WIN THE LEAGUE WITH OUR SECOND AMENDMENT.  WE ARE GOING TO KEEP WINNING AT  EVERY LEVEL. WE ARE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH THAT  YOU ARE GOING TO COMMON YOU ARE  GOING TO SAY, ""IS THE PRESIDENT, WE ARE WINNING SO MUCH, I CAN'T  STAND IT ANYMORE,"" AND I'M GOOD  SAY, ""I DON'T CARE.""

THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS WAS AN AMAZING EVENING. THIS WAS A GREAT EVENING. THEY JUST ANNOUNCED NORTH CAROLINA.  I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE  ANNOUNCED ILLINOIS YET BUT WE  ARE LEADING BY A LOT. I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO  ANNOUNCE IT. FLORIDA IS SO AMAZING. I WANT TO THANK OUR FRIENDS.  WE PICKED UP NINE DELEGATES THIS MORNING.  I HEARD VERY EARLY IN THE  MORNING. THAT IS A LOT.  I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE GOVERNOR, RALPH HALL AS, CHAIRMAN ATTA, THAT WAS A NICE  START TO THE DAY. MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING  OVER THE LAST SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THE POLL SAID 49% TO 14%. WE JUST HAD ONE FROM THE ECONOMIST WHO JUST CAME OUT. 53%. I WAS WATCHING THE NEWS AND ONE  OF THE COMMENTATORS I'M NOT  PARTICULARLY FOND OF SAID DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T GET OVER 50% BECAUSE I MET 43.  45.  NOW I MET 53. I HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THESE  PEOPLE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND  BASIC PHYSICS, BASIC  MATHEMATICS. WHEN I DON'T GET OVER 50% WE HAVE FOUR PEOPLE.  WE HAVE FOUR PEOPLE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?  WHEN I GET 53 PERCENT, THAT IS  WITH FOUR PEOPLE. THAT IS AN AMAZING ACHIEVEMENT MATHEMATICALLY WHEN YOU CAN GET  OVER 50 PERCENT.  SOMEDAY THEY ARE GOING TO UNDERSTAND WHEN WE TAKE IT ALL.  THEY WILL UNDERSTAND. I WANT TO THANK MY FAMILY.  THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING SO HARD.  YVONNEIVANKA IS HOME RIGHT NOW.  SHE IS READY TO HAVE THE BABY. WE HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT  FOR A LITTLE WHILE. SHE HAS BEEN SO HELPFUL.  JARRETT HAS BEEN AMAZING. I WANT TO THANK BARON FOR THING  UP WITH THE FACT THAT I NEVER  SEE HIM ANYMORE.  I NEVER SEE HIM. IT IS HIS BIRTHDAY. HE SAYS WHEN YOU COMING HOME? IN ABOUT TWO AND A HALF WEEKS,  IT IS PRETTY TOUGH WHEN YOU'RE  TRAVELING ALL OVER THE PLACE. I WENT UP TO YOUNGSTOWN, WE HAD  AN INCREDIBLE CROWD NADAND JUST  AMAZING PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY.  IF SO MANY GREAT PEOPLE. WE WILL, SOMEDAY IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE, OTHERWISE IS NOT GOING TO  HAPPEN, BUT APPLE AND ALL THESE GREAT COMPANIES WILL BE MAKING  THEIR PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED  STATES.  NOT IN CHINA, VIETNAM, AND ALL  OVER --    WE'RE NOT GOING TO  BE LOSING OUR COUNTRY -- OUR COMPANIES ARE LEAVING RAPIDLY.  WHETHER IT IS FORD, EATON, I WAS IN CLEVELAND, AND EATON CORP IS  LEAVING FOR STUFF, I'M DISGUSTED  WITH IT.  I AM TIRED OF IT, THERE IS NO  REASON FORT. IT IS GROSS INCOMPETENCE AT THE  HIGHEST LEVEL. WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW IT TO  HAPPEN. PFIZER, GREAT COMPANY, THEY'RE  GOING TO IRELAND.  THERE IS SO MNANY MORE, YOUR CORPORATE INVERSIONS.  THEY CAN GET THE MONEY BECAUSE  THE POLITICIANS CAN'T GET ALONG,  CAN'T MAKE A DEAL FOR THE  EVERYBODY AGREES, DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN, THAT THE MONEY  SHOULD COME BACK. THERE IS TWO POINT $5 TRILLION  OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY.  EVERYBODY AGREES THAT THE MONEY  SHOULD BE HERE.   WE CAN MAKE A  DEAL, THERE IS NOT EXAMPLE OF  SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO IF I  SAT DOWN WITH A FEW THE  SENATORS, AND THE CONGRESSMAN, YOU CAN MAKE IT BACK IN 10  MINUTES IF HE KNEW YOU WERE  DOING. EVERYBODY WANTS TO DO IT.  COMPANIES ARE LEAVING OUR  COUNTRY TO GET THERE MONEY. NOT ONLY BECAUSE OUR TAXES ARE TOO HIGH -- WHICH WILL LOWER, BY  THE WAY -- BUT THEY'RE LEAVING  IN ORDER TO GO AND GET MONEY  THAT IS THEIR MONEY BECAUSE  THERE IS NO WAY OF BRINGING IT  IN.  WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO.  AT SOME POINT, IT IS GOING TO  GET DONE. THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS BEEN VERY EXCITING.  I WAS ONE OF 17 PEOPLE WHEN WE  STARTED. SENATORS, GOVERNORS, I'VE HAD  SUCH GREAT SUPPORT.  DR. BEN CARSON THE OTHER DAY ENDORSED US.  GREAT GUY, GREAT GUY, WONDERFUL  MAN. AND CHRIS CHRISTIE ENDORSED US,  THAT WAS SO INCREDIBLE.   AND TODAY PAM CAME  UP AND ENDORSED US, THAT WAS  GREAT. SHE IS A TRULY WONDERFUL WOMAN,  AND THE JOB SHE HAS DONE IN  FLORIDA IS INCREDIBLE. SO MANY, WE'VE HAD SUCH  INCREDIBLE SUPPORT.  PAUL RYAN CALLED MANY OTHER DAY,  HE TREMENDOUS CALL.  I SPOKE WITH MITCH MCCONNELL TODAY, AND MANY GREAT CONVERSATION. WE HAVE TO BRING OUR PARTY TOGETHER.  WE HAVE TO BRING IT TOGETHER.   WITH SOMETHING  HAPPENING THAT MAKES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY PROBABLY THE  BIGGEST POLITICAL STORY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.  EVERYBODY IS WRITING ABOU TIT, -- ABOUT IT, ALL OVER EUROPE EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT.  MANY MORE PEOPLE, LOOKING AT THE  POLLING BOOTHS AND DIFFERENT  POLLING BOOTHS OVER THE COUNTRY. THE LINES ARE 4, 5, 6, BLOCKS  LONG. LUMINOUS BEEN IN THE FOR 40  YEARS AND SAID WE WOULD HAVE 2 PEOPLE HERE, NOW LOOK AT THE  LINE.  BUT LIKE IT WAS LONG, IT WAS REALLY LONG. FICE DE -- FIVE DEEP, AND LONG. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE VOTING --  DEMOCRATS ARE COMING IN, INDEPENDENTS ARE COMING IN,  AND PEOPLE THAT NEVER VOTED  BEFORE.  IT IS AN INCREDIBLE THING.   I WANT TO PAY  MARS BECKS TO TODD PALIN,  SARAH'S HUSBAND. SHE WAS MAKING A SPEECH OF MY  BEHALF AND IT WAS FANTASTIC WAS  THAT EVERYBODY LOVES HER.  HE WAS IN AN ACCIDENT, IT IS  TOUGH, BUT HE IS GOING TO BE  FINE. I WANT TO PAY MY RESPECTS TO  TODD. SO, OUR THEME, WHEN WE STARTED, AND -- SITDOWN EVERYBODY,  PLEASE. WE GIVE YOU SEATS, READER HAVE  TO STAND.    I'M LOOKING AT ALL THESE PEOPLE. GOOD JOB. OUR WHOLE SQUAD, RIGHT?  SO, WHEN THIS BEGAN, I SAID YOU  HAVE TO DO IT. SHE WAS SO SUPPORTIVE.  SHE HAS BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE, AND WE HAVE TO DO IT. WE CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR, AND IT WAS ABOUT TRADE AND BORDERS. CRITICALLY AFTER THAT, AND WE  SHOT RIGHT TO THE TOP OF THE  POLLS.  WE HAVE BEEN LEADING HIM WAS  FROM THE BEGINNING WITHOUT FAIL.  WE WENT UP IN JUNE, MOST PEOPLE  SAID I WOULD NEVER RUN, HE JUST GOING TO HAVE FUN.  I MEAN, I'M HAVING A GOOD TIME. I AM HAVING A VERY NICE TIME,  BUT I'M WORKING VERY HARD.  THERE IS GREAT ANGER.   ONE OF THE  BROADCASTERS WERE SAYING IS  THERE ANGER? A PERSON SUPPOSED TO SAY NO THEY'RE NOT COME WITH LOVE THE  THINGS ARE WORKING -- THE WAY  THINGS ARE WORKING. WE LOVE ALL THE DEALS, THE TRADE DEASL AR -- DEALS ARE WONDERFUL. WE LOSE 58 BILLION DOLLARS A  YEAR IN TERMS OF IMBALANCE.  IT IS A TOTAL IMBALANCE. WE DON'T MAKE A GOOD DEALS  ANYMORE, WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE.  THEY ASK IS THERE ANGER? OI SAIDF THERE IS ANGER. THEY WANT TO SEE THE COUNTRY  PROPERLY RUN. THEY WANT TO SEE THINGS PROPERLY TAKEN CARE OF.  THEY WANT OUR MILITARY REBUILT, OUR MILITARIES IN A VERY BAD  STATE. THEY WANT IT REBUILT.   THEY WANT THE  SECOND AMENDMENT PROTECTED, AND  PROTECTED STRONGLY.  THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT SO  BADLY? THEY WANT OUR VETERANS TAKEN  CARE OF. OUR VETERANS ARE TREATED SO  BADLY.   SO, WE STARTED AND SOMETHING HAPPENED -- PARIS HAPPEN. PARIS WAS A DISASTER. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY DISASTERS. THEN WE HAD A CASE IN LOS  ANGELES WHERE IT WAS IN CALIFORNIA -- WHERE THE 14 YOUNG  PEOPLE WERE KILLED. IT JUST GOES ON AND ON. WHAT HAPPENED WITH ME IS THIS WHOLE RUN TOOK ON A HOLD OF  MEANING. NOT JUST BORDERS, OR GOOD TRADE DEALS, WILL MAKE THE BEST RADIOS  YOU EVER SEEN. WE'VE HAD ENDORSEMENT FROM THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN BUSINESS.  THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE  NEGOTIATING OUR DEALS.  THEY'RE THE BEST IN THE WORLD. WE WILL HAVE SUCH A GREAT DEALS, WE WILL DO SO GOOD WITH TRADE, AND THE BORDER, BUT IT TOOK ON A WHOLE NEW MEANING.  THE MEANING IS VERY SIMPLE.  WE NEED PROTECTION IN OUR COUNTRY, AND THAT IS GOING TO  HAPPEN.  ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE POLL  NUMBERS SHOT UP.  I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GO AND  DO A LOT OF TRIPS OVER THE NEXT  COUPLE OF MONTHS.  I THINK WE'LL HAVE A GREAT  VICTORY. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE'RE GOING TO  START WINNING AGAIN. THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN.  WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE.   WE DON'T WIN WITH  OUR MILITARY, WE CAN'T BEAT ISIS. WE'RE GOING TO KNOCK THE HELL  OUT OF THEM. WE DON'T WIN AND TRADE, CHINA, EVERYBODY. JAPAN, MEXICO, VIETNAM, INDIA,  NAME THE COUNTRY. ANYBODY WE DO BUSINESS WITH  BEATS US. WE WILL MAKE OUR COUNTRY RICH  AGAIN, AND A GREAT AGAIN. WE NEED THE RICH TO MAKE THE  GRADE, I'M SORRY TO TELL YOU.   I'M GOING FORWARD,  WE HAD A FANTASTIC EVENING.  WOULD'VE NEVER THOUGHT THIS  COULD HAPPEN. WE ARE WAITING FOR ONE RESULT  WHICH COULD BE VERY SUCCESSFUL  ALSO.  TO WIN THE STATES THAT WE WON,  AND BY THE MARGINS. THIS IS MY SECOND HOME, FLORIDA.  TO WIN BY THAT KIND OF A NUMBER  IS INCREDIBLE.   I HAVE TO SAY IT, I WANT TO CONGRATULATE MARCO  RUBIO ON HAVING RUN A REALLY  TOUGH CAMPAIGN.  HE IS TOUGH, HE IS SMART, AND IS  A  I HAVE TO SAY,  NOBODY HAS EVER, AND HISTORY  POLITICS, RECEIVED THE KIND OF  NEGATIVE ADVERTISING THAT I  HAVE. RECORD, RECORD, RECORD, MOSTLY FALSE POST ON THAT WOULDN'T SAY 100%, BUT ABOUT 90%.   MOSTLY FALSE, VICIOUS, HORRIBLE, THEY SAID WAS  18 MILLION THE FIRST WEEK,  MEETING LAST WEEK. IT ADDED UP TO OVER 40 MILLION  DOLLARS. YOU EXPLAINED IT TO ME, BECAUSE I CAN'T. MY NUMBERS WENT UP, I DON'T  UNDERSTAND IT.  NOBODY UNDERSTANDS IT. MY NUMBERS WENT UP.   IT HAS BEEN AN  INTERESTING EXPERIENCE. ADAM SCOTT, ONE AT A GOLF TOURNAMENT RECENTLY.  I'M WATCHING FAMILY WITH TELEVISION SCREENS ALL OVER. WE ARE DOWN AT THIS GORGEOUS  GREEN, THEN A COMMERCIAL COMES  ON.  THE WORST COMMERCIAL.  I AM WITH THESE WONDERFUL PEOPLE  FROM CADILLAC, AND THE STOP EXECUTIVES.  WHEN I SAY LOOK OVER THERE,  DON'T WATCH IT, YOU DON'T WANT  TO WATCH THIS.  ISN'T THE GRASS BEAUTIFUL? LOOK, DON'T WATCH. THEY CAME IN WAVES, ONE COME  AFTER ANOTHER, AFTER ANOTHER. THEN ADAM COMES AND IS THIS HANDSOME KID FROM AUSTRALIA. HE MADE AN UNBELIEVABLE SHOT ON  THE 18TH HOLE.  HE IS A GREAT CHAMPION, JUST BEFORE WE BREAK FOR A COMMERCIAL -- WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK MARK  RATE CHECK FROM AUSTRALIA, ADAM  SCOTT. AND IT WAS THE COMMERCIAL, AND I  SAID NO. AND IT WAS TWO OF THEM. WHAT A DAY THAT WAS, WHAT A  DISASTER.   UNBELIEVABLE. SO AGAIN, I WANT TO CONGRATULATE EVERYBODY. THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING PROCESS.  IT IS AN AMAZING PROCESS. IT IS VERY TOUGH, BY THE END IF  YOU GET TO THE END YOU CAN  HANDLE A LOT OF THINGS,  INCLUDING PRESSURE. THAT IC CAN TELL YOU. THERE IS NOTHING LIKE IT. LIES, DECEIT, VICIOUSNESS, HORRIBLE THINGS.  SOME ARE NICE. SOME ARE NICE. SOME ARE REALLY DISGUSTING PEOPLE BACK THERE. I WANT TO SAY, WE WILL GO FORWARD.  WE WILL WIN, BUT MORE  IMPORTANTLY WE WILL WIN FOR THE  COUNTRY. WE WILL WIN, WIN , WIN, AND WE'RE  NOT STOPPING.  I GIVE EVERYBODY. -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. ",Donald Trump Primary Night Speech

WE ARE DOING GREAT IN FLORIDA, GREAT IN ILLINOIS. MISSOURI, I THINK WE WILL HAVE A TREMENDOUS DAY. I HAVE TO COME OUT HERE AND EXPLAIN A COUPLE OF THINGS BECAUSE WHAT IS GOING ON -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU READ ""THE ART OF THE DEAL,"" BUT I WORKED ONFOR A LONG TIME IN OHIO. IT WAS IN CINCINNATI. IT WAS A GREAT SUCCESS. IT WAS A HORRIBLE JOB. IT WAS A MESS. I TOOK IT OVER, I FIXED IT. I COME OUT HERE ALL THE TIME. I BOUGHT IT FOR X AND SOLD IT FOR X. AFTER THAT, THE JOB DID NOT DO TOO WELL BUT WE WERE GONE. USUALLY WE HOLD BUT THIS TIME WE DID NOT. IT GAVE ME AN UNBELIEVABLE FEELING FOR THE PEOPLE OF OHIO. I HAVE STAYED HERE, WORK HERE, AND I LIKE THEOVE THE PEOPLE OF OHIO. IT WAS REALLY ONE OF MY FIRST BIG JOBS. 1164 UNITS AND WE BOUGHT IT FROM THE FHA FOR NOTHING AND SOLD IT FOR A LOT OF MONEY. IT IS LIKE IF YOU ARE A BASEBALL PLAYER AND YOU GET THAT FIRST HIT, OR IF YOU ARE A GOLFER. IT GAVE ME A GREAT CONFIDENCE AND I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THIS PLACE. I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT, FOLKS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THIS ALL BEGAN VERY STRONGLY IN JUNE. JUNE 16, TO BE EXACT. I SAID TO MY WIFE, WE HAVE TO DO THIS. THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DO. OUR COUNTRY IS BEING SO BADLY LED, LED INTO THIS HORRIBLE DEAL WITH IRAN. THIS DEAL WILL REPAY $350 BIL LION. WE GET NOTHING. WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER STARTED NEGOTIATING THE DEAL UNTIL WE GOT OUR PRISONERS BACK.  THEY NEVER ONCE WALKED, DID ANYTHING. CONSTANTLY, YOU WOULD SEE BACK IN IRAN, PEOPLE DANCING IN THE STREETS BEFORE THE DEAL WAS DONE. THEY ARE DANCING, CALLING US ALL STUPID. THE DEAL WAS A JOKE. IT WAS A JOKE. IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST NEGOTIATED TRANSACTION OF ANY KIND I HAVE EVER SEEN. THEY COULD HAVE WALKED, THEY COULD HAVE GONE IN AND SAID BEFORE WE START, WE NEED OUR PRISONERS BACK. THIS WOULD BE 3.5, FOUR YEARS AGO. THEY WOULD HAVE SAID NO. THE PERSIANS BEING GREAT NEGOTIATORS. AND THEN, WE GET UP AND WALK AND WE GO OUT AND DOUBLED UP THE SANCTIONS. WITHIN 24 HOURS, THEY WOULD CALL BACK AND SAY WE ARE GIVING YOU BACK THE PRISONERS. THEN, WE GO IN A SECOND TIME AND SAY, LISTEN, WE HAVE A PROBLEM. WE OWE $19 TRILLION. WE CANNOT GIVE YOU THE $150 BILLION BACK. CANNOT DO IT. I TELL THAT STORY. SOME OF THE MEDIA WHO, BY THE WAY, ARE THE MOST DISHONEST PEOPLE ON EARTH. THE WORST.    BOO. SO TRUE. SO TRUE. LIKE, LOOK AT HIS MASSIVE CROWD IN THIS BIG HANGAR. WE SET THIS UP LIKE, WHAT, 15 HOURS AGO, RIGHT? JUST LOOK, BECAUSE I WANTED TO COME UP. THIS IS A PLACE I WANT TO WIN. THIS IS GOING TO DO IT. OHIO IS GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  KASICH CANNOT MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. CAN'T DO IT. HE CAN DO IT. 'T DO IT. IF YOU DIDN'T HIT OIL, YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A DISASTER. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN AS BAD AS ANY OF THEM. YOU GOT LUCKY. OIL HAS NOW GONE WAY DOWN BUT YET YOUR BUDGET HAS GONE UP 35% MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT MEANS YOU WILL HAVE A BIG PROBLEM. IT HAS ARE EVEN TALKED ABOUT. TWO DAYS AGO, I WAS IN CLEVELAND. IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. LIKE, 25,000 PEOPLE. JUST BEFORE I WENT ON, ONE OF THE MANAGERS OF THE ARENA CAME OVER. PATRICK AND RAYMOND PARK, THEY OWN IT. THEY DO A BEAUTIFUL JOB. HE SAID IT IS SO SAD. RIGHT OVER THERE, EDENCORP GOING TO MEXICO. FORD GOING TO MEXICO. HE POINTED TO OTHER PLACES AND I SAID, WOW, THAT IS SAD. THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING, FOLKS. WITH ME, IT WILL NOT HAPPEN ANYMORE. WE WILL NOT BE THE DUMMIES ANYMORE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE THE DUMMIES ANYMORE.  YOU ARE LOSING YOUR JOB, YOUR INCOME, YOUR FACTORIES. THEY ARE GOING TO CHINA, GOING TO MEXICO. JAPAN IS KILLING US WITH THE CARS. NOW IT IS VIETNAM, INDIA, EVERYBODY. WE DON'T MAKE GOOD DEALS ANYMORE. WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE. WHERE DO WE WIN? WE LOSE ON TRADE, THE MILITARY. WE CANNOT BEAT ISIS. WE CAN'T BEAT ISIS> . HERE WE HAVE A MILITARY AND CANNOT BEAT ISIS> WE. WE ALL KNOW HOW TO WIN ANYMORE. IT IS NOT IN OUR CULTURE ANYMORE. THE OLD EXPRESSION, TO THE VICTOR BELONG THE SPOILS. I DID NOT WANT TO GO IN. YOU ARE GOING TO DESTABILIZE THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST AND THEY WENT INTO IRAQ AND IT WAS A MISTAKE. NOW, OBAMA GETS OUT. THE WAY HE GOT OUT WAS SO BAD. HE PUTS OUT A DATE. THE ENEMY SAYS, WOW. THEY CANNOT BELIEVE IT. HE PUSHES OUT A DATE. BAD THING TO DO. IN ALL FAIRNESS, WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THERE BUT WE SHOULD HAVE LEFT SOME TRUTHOOPME TROOPS BEHIND. IRAN IS TAKING OVER IRAQ. IRAQ AS THE SECOND LARGEST OIL RESERVES IN THE WORLD. THE IRAN DEAL -- I USED TO SAY ONE OF THE GREATEST DEALS I HAVE EVER SEEN WAS THE IRAN DEAL, BUT ACTUALLY, THE GREATEST DEAL I HAVE SEEN IS JUST NOW. IRAN IS TAKING OVER IRAQ. SECOND LARGEST OIL RESERVES IN THE WORLD. THAT IS THE GREATEST DEAL. THEY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING WITH THE IRAQ FOREVER AND THEY GO 10 FEET ONE-WAY, 10 FEET THE OTHER WAY AND THEN THEY REST. THEN THEY GO AGAIN. FOR YEARS AND YEARS, THEY FOUGHT. BUT THEY WERE THE SAME. THEY WERE EQUAL MILITARY STRENGTH. SADDAM HUSSEIN WOULD DROP GAS. THEY WOULD COMPLAIN, THEY WOULD DROP GAS. THIS WENT ON FOREVER. AND THEN WE OBLITERATED ONE OF THE TWO POWERS. TO ME, IT WAS OBVIOUS. I SAID, DON'T DO IT. NOW, IRAN IS TAKING OVER IRAQ. IRAN IS GOING IN WITH YEMEN. THEY DON'T WANT YEMEN, BUT THEY LIKE THE LONG, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BORDER THAT SEPARATES YEMEN FROM SAUDI ARABIA. I'VE BEEN PRETTY GOOD WITH THESE PREDICTIONS. WHEN I WROTE A BOOK IN THE YEAR 2000, I MENTIONED IN THE BOOK OSAMA BIN LADEN. EVERYBODY SAID DON'T FORGET THAT WAS A YEAR AND A HALF BEFORE THE WORLD TRADE CENTER CAME DOWN. EVERYBODY SAID, I DON'T BELIEVE IT. AN ANNOUNCER IN THE MORNING SAID, WAIT A MINUTE. TRUMP WAS TALKING ABOUT OSAMA BIN LADEN BEFORE HE KNOCKED DOWN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER. THE GUY SAID NO WAY AND THEY LOOKED AT THE BOOK. THAT IS WHAT I DID. WE HAD TO TAKE THEM OUT. WE HAD OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE HIM OUT. I'M GOOD ON THE PROGNOSTICATION. YEARS AGO, I DID THIS WHOLE CRAZY POLITICAL THING. WE HAVE BEEN SUPPORTERS AND FRIENDS FOR A LONG TIME. I SAID TAKE THE OIL. I DID NOT WANT TO BE THERE, BUT NOW WE ARE. IF YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVE, TAKE THE OIL, TAKE THE OIL. I KEPT SAYING THAT AND THEY SAID YOU CANNOT TAKE THE OIL. WHAT A TERRIBLE THING. THIS IS A SOVEREIGN COUNTRY. A COUNTRY THAT WAS BLOWN OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH. YOU HAVE THE LEADERS THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND WERE TOTALLY CORRUPT.  HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. THESE WERE CORRUPT PEOPLE. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED WITH ISIS. THEY WOULD NOT INCLUDE THESE PEOPLE AND ISIS TURNED OUT TO BE A LOT TOUGHER AND SMARTER THAN THE PEOPLE WE CHOSE. THEY DID NOT INCLUDE THEM. WHO HAS THE OIL? IRAN HAS THE OIL AND ISIS. WHAT DO WE HAVE? WE SPENT YEARS THERE. $2 TRILLION IN COSTS. THOUSANDS OF LIVES, WOUNDED WARRIORS WHO WE LOVE ALL OVER THE PLACE. WHAT DO WE HAVE? WE HAVE NOTHING. IF OUR LEADERS WOULD HAVE GONE AWAY, TELL THEM TO GO AWAY TO THE BEACH AND SUN THEMSELVES FOR FOUR YEARS, WE HAVE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF. SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS NOT A GOOD PERSON. WHO CARES? HE WAS GREAT AT KILLING TERRORISTS. HE WOULD KILL TERRORISTS. NOW IRAQW IS HARVARD UNIVERSITY FOR TERRORISTS. THAT IS WHAT THEY DO. THEY KILL. WE DON'T DO -- THEY DEVELOP TERRORISTS ALL OVER THE PLACE NOW. IT IS FAR WORSE THAN BEFORE WE STARTED. IN THE MEANTIME, WE HAVE OUR COUNTRY. IT IS CRUMBLING. YOU LOOK AT OUR AIRPORTS, HOSPITALS, ROADS AND HIGHWAYS, THE BRIDGES ARE FALLING DOWN. YOU LOOK AT OUR SCHOOLS. OUR COUNTRY IS FALLING APART. WE HAVE BECOME THIRD WORLD IN MANY RESPECTS. YOU GO TO DUBAI, QATAR, SOME OF THESE PLACES AND YOU LAND AT AIRPORTS. YOU SAY, OH, MAN, LOOK AT THIS AIRPORT. I WAS IN QATAR AND THEY WERE SHOWING ME THIS BEAUTIFUL AIRPORT. I SAID AKBAR -- NICE GUY. I GET ALONG WITH EVERYBODY. THEY WERE SHOWING ME, THE HEAD OF THE AIRLINE -- THIS IS THIS AND THIS IS THAT. WE HAVE SPAS FOR THE PEOPLE. I SAID THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. HE SAID, NO, NO, THIS IS JUST A TEMPORARY. THE REAL AIRPORT IS BEING BUILT OVER THERE. I GET BACK ON MY PLANE AND LAND INN LAGUARDIA WITH POTHOLES ALL OVER THEM. WE ARE BECOMING THIRD WORLD. HERE IS A STORY. IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO VOTE TOMORROW. YOU GOT TO VOTE. IF YOU HAVE A HEADACHE --  IF YOU ARE DYING, I MEAN, IF YOU ARE DYING -- IF YOU JUST WENT TO YOUR DOCTOR, ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD COST TOO MUCH BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE. WE ARE REPEALING AND REPLACING OBAMACARE.  BUT IF YOU GO TO YOUR DOCTOR AND HE TELLS YOU IT IS OVER, IT IS JUST DONE. YOU ARE DONE. YOU ARE GOING TO BE DEAD IN THREE WEEKS. DOESN'T MATTER. GET OUT TOMORROW AND VOTE. THINK ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN, YOUR FAMILY. GET OUT TOMORROW AND VOTE, OK? YOU GOT TO DO IT. IT IS A MOVEMENT LIKE THEY HAVE NOT SEEN. I TELL YOU WHAT, THE COVER OF ""TIME"" FOUR TIMES, TAKE A LOOK. THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE WRITING. THE SINGLE BIGGEST STORY IN POLITICS TODAY IN THE WORLD IS WHAT IS HAPPENING, OF ALL THINGS, TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE HAD A PARTY THAT WAS OBSOLETE. MITT ROMNEY COULD NOT RUN FOR DOG CATCHER. THIS GUY WAS A DISASTER. WE HAD A PARTY THAT SHOULD HAVE ONE THE LAST ELECTION. I BACKED MCCAIN, HE LOST. I BACKED ROMNEY, HE LOST. I SAID THIS TIME WE ARE GOING TO DO IT OURSELVES, FOLKS. WE ARE GOING TO DO IT RIGHT.  WE GOT TO DO IT RIGHT. SO, THE BIGGEST STORY IN POLITICS WORLDWIDE, IT IS ALL OVER THE WORLD, IS WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. HERE IS THE STORY -- I HAVE WON 16 STATES. I THINK WE WILL HAVE A GREAT DAY TOMORROW.  THE ONE'S THAT IS CLOSEST IS YOU GET OUT AND VOTE. I THINK WE WILL HAVE A PHENOMENAL DAY. FLORIDA IS LOOKING FANTASTIC. FLORIDA IS REALLY LOOKING -- A SENATOR THAT DOES NOT SHOW UP TO VOTE. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A SENATOR THAT DOES NOT SHOW UP TO VOTE? YOU CANNOT HAVE THAT EITHER BUT FLORIDA IS LOOKING REALLY FANTASTIC. THEY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF THE SAME CHARACTERISTICS. YOU HAVE RUBIO WHO DOES NOT VOTE. AND YOUR GOVERNOR IS ABSENTEE. HE GOES -- LISTEN TO THIS BECAUSE I KNOW. I STILL WORK. I HAVE A JOB. SO, YOUR GOVERNOR KASICH, IF YOU LOOK AT HIM -- I'M BEING TOTALLY IMPARTIAL. HE GOES TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, HE IS LIVING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. WHERE'S CHRIS? EVEN MORE THAN CHRIS CHRISTIE, HE WAS THERE. RIGHT? EVEN MORE. I HATED TO DO THAT, BUT I HAD TO MAKE MY POINT. HE GOES TO NEW HAMPSHIRE. HE LIVES THERE. HE LOSES BADLY. HE GETS KILLED. I WIN IN A LANDSLIDE. I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. THEY GAVE ME MY FIRST BIG VICTORY AND IT WAS EARLY ON. EVERYBODY WANTS TO WIN IOWA SO THEY CAN WIN NEW HAMPSHIRE, I WON NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE GO TO SOUTH CAROLINA. I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO WIN THAT BECAUSE IT IS HEAVILY EVANGELICAL, BUT I'M A GREAT CHRISTIAN AND I UNDERSTAND EVANGELICALS. AN EVANGELICAL IS SMART AND THEY DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER -- LYING TED CRUZ. HE IS LYING TED CRUZ. HE WALKS IN WITH HIS NONSENSE, HIS PHONY STUFF. HE LIFTS THE BIBLE UP HIGH AND SAYS HERE I AM, I'M LYING TED CRUZ AND THEN HE STARTS LYING FOR THE WHOLE NIGHT. HE KNOWS WHAT YOUR POSITION IS. HE TELLS PEOPLE OF THE OPPOSITE. WHAT HE DID TO BEN CARSON, WHO JUST ENDORSE ME BY THE WAY.  GREAT GOT. UY. IN IOWA, BEN WAS DOING REALLY WELL AND I WAS. TED CRUZ SAID THAT BEN CARSON JUST QUIT THE RACE AND THE VOTING WAS NOT CLOSE TO ENDING. RIGHT AFTER THE RACE ENDED, HE CALLED HIM AND APOLOGIZED. GIVE ME A BREAK. I DON'T KNOW IF BEN HAS FORGOTTEN THAT WERE FORGIVEN THAT. BEN ENDORSED ME A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO. YOU KNOW WHO ELSE ENDORSED ME WAS SHERIFF JOE. YOU KNOW YOU ARE TOUGH ON THE BORDERS IF HE ENDORSES YOU. WE HAVE SHERIFF JOE. WE HAVE SARAH PALIN WHO ENDORSED. JERRY FALWELL, JR. FROM LIBERTY UNIVERSITY -- SO GREAT. HE REALLY HELPED ME WITH EVANGELICALS. WE GO TO SOUTH CAROLINA AND THAT IS GOING TO BE TED CRUZ COUNTRY. THAT IS LYING TED CRUZ COUNTRY. WE GO AND EVERYBODY SAYS HE IS GOING TO WIN. WHO WINS? TRUMP. WHO GETS THE MILITARY, THE VETS -- BECAUSE WHEN THEY ARE LEAVING, THEY DO THE POLLS. I OWNWON WITH THE MILITARY, THE VETS, EVANGELICALS, EVERYBODY. I WON WITH WOMEN, MEN. I WON WITH HIGHLY EDUCATED. I WON WITH LESS THAN HIGHLY EDUCATED. WE WON WITH EVERY SINGLE CATEGORY. IT HAS BEEN GREAT. SAME THING WITH NEVADA. I WIN WITH NEVADA IN A LANDSLIDE. THE BIG THING IS THIS -- I SAY HELLO TO THE PEOPLE THAT WORK AT THE POLLING BOOTHS. A WOMAN COMES UP TO ME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SHE SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT, I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS. IN 40 YEARS, WE USED TO HAVE THREE PEOPLE, ANOTHER FOUR PEOPLE. IT WAS VERY LIGHT. I LOOKED AT THE LINES. THEY WERE FIVE BLOCKS LONG. FWE HAVE TAKEN IN MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THEY CAME OUT FROM THE DEMOCRATS. THEY CAME AS THE INDEPENDENTS. THE THING I'M MOST PROUD OF -- I SEE IT WHEN I SIGN AND SHAKE CANS WITH PEOPLE -- EVERY 20TH PERSON SAYS, YOU KNOW, I HAVE NEVER, EVER VOTED BEFORE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 40-YEAR-OLD PEOPLE. ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE? HAVE YOU NEVER VOTED BEFORE? THANK YOU. THAT IS SO COOL. WHO HAS NEVER VOTED BEFORE? WOW. AND YOU ARE ALL VOTING, RIGHT? I'M TELLING YOU. THEY JUST SAID IT ON ONE OF THE STATIONS COMING IN. IT IS A PHENOMENA AND IT IS PHENOMENAL. SO MANY PEOPLE. THEY SAID I NEVER WANTED TO VOTE BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY I WANTED TO VOTE FOR. WE HAVE THE DEMOCRATS AND WE ARE UP MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF VOTES. IT IS INTERESTING. I WATCHED LYING TED A LITTLE WHILE AGO AND HE WAS SAYING I'M THE ONLY 1 -- HE IS A GOOD DEBATER BUT HE CANNOT TALK -- HE SAYS ON THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN BEAT TRUMP. I BEAT HIM FIVE TIMES. IT IS LIKE A PROFESSIONAL DEBATE ARTIST. I HAVE WON EVERY DEBATE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. ACCORDING TO DRUDGE, THEY DO THE POLLS AFTER THE DEBATES. AFTER EVERY SINGLE DEBATE, TIME MAGAZINE, DRUDGE, THEY DO POLLS. I THINK I HAVE WON EVERY SINGLE ONE. REALLY. LYING TED GOES, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN STOP TRUMP. NOBODY ELSE. I HAVE BEATEN HIM FIVE TIMES. AND THEN I SAID TO MYSELF, IS ANYBODY GOING TO SPEAK UP? NOBODY DOES. AT THE DEBATE, HE SAYS I HAVE BEEN HIM FIVE TIMES. AND I SAID, YEAH, BUT I HAVE BEEN YOU 15 TIMES.  I DON'T KNOW. HE IS LYING TED. SO IMPORTANT. WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT PROBLEMS. I WANT TO READ YOU SOMETHING BECAUSE I LOVE IT. WE NEED SECURITY. WE NEED BORDERS. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL. THE WALL WILL BE BUILT.  THE WALL IS GOING TO BE BUILT, 100%. BUILD THAT WALL, BUILD THAT WALL, BUILD THAT WALL.  IT IS GOING TO BE BUILT. AND, AND, WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL? MEXICO. 100%. WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT WITH MEXICO, FOLKS. THEY USED TO SAY YOU CANNOT BUILD A WALL AND THEN I SAID THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA IS 13,000 MILES LONG, MUCH BIGGER, AND IT WAS BUILT 2000 YEARS AGO. WHY CAN'T WE? THE OTHER DAY, I HEAR THESE GUYS SAYING WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A WALL. MY WIFE HEARD IT AND SHE SAID I THINK THEY JUST SAID THAT. THEN, THEY SAY, YOU CANNOT GET MEXICO TO PAY FOR THE WALL. OK, REMEMBER THIS -- ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE CAN DO IT. ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE IS SMARTER THAN THE PEOPLE RUNNING OUR COUNTRY.  REMEMBER THIS, REMEMBER THIS. THE WALL IS GOING TO COST $10 BILLION. A LOT OF MONEY. IT IS GOING TO BE LIKE THE OLD POST OFFICE. UNDER BUDGET, AHEAD OF SCHEDULE -- IT IS GOING TO BE A GREAT. THE THING I DO BEST IS BUILD. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD IT. IT IS GOING TO COST $10 BILLION. THAT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. THAT IS UP THERE. THEY DON'T BUILD THEM LIKE THEY USED TO. IT IS GOING TO BE RIGHT UP THERE. PROBABLY HIGHER THAN THAT. 45-50 FEET. HERE IS THE STORY. SO, THEY SAY, YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET MEXICO TO PAY 100%. NO WAY, THESE ARE THE PEOPLE OF RUNNING AGAINST. WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT WITH MEXICO. $58 BILLION, RIGHT? THE WALL IS GOING TO COST $10 BILLION. THEY ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL. WHEN YOU HAVE $58 BILLION, AND YOU WANT $10 BILLION TO PAY FOR THE WALL -- THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS THEY CAN DO IT AND I'M NOT PUSHY. THEY ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL. SO EASY, SO EASY. YOU PROBABLY SAW THE OTHER DAY VICENTE FOX, THE EX-PRESIDENT. WHAT DID HE DO? HE THREW OUT THE ""F"" BOMB. IF I DID THAT, I WOULD GET THE ELECTRIC CHAIR. THEY WOULD SAY IT IS THE ELECTRIC CHAIR. NOBODY EVEN TALKED ABOUT IT. WHAT HE DID WAS GOOD BECAUSE HE SAID THERE WAS NO WAY WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THE YOU KNOW WHAT WALL. VICENTE. THERE IS NO WAY -- REALLY ANGRY AND ARROGANT. I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF MEXICO. I HAVE THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES. HISPANICS  -- IWIN WIN IN THE POLES WITH HISPANICS IN ADDITION TO EVERY OTHER GROUP BECAUSE I WILL BRING JOBS BACK. I'M BRINGING THE JOBS BACK. I'M BRINGING THEM BACK FROM CHINA, FROM MEXICO. I'M BRINGING JOBS BACK. VICENTE FOX, THE GOOD AND THE BAD, HE SAID THERE IS NO WAY WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THE YOU KNOW WHAT WALL AND ANGRY. I SAID WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS BECAUSE HE USED TO SAY THERE IS NO WAY WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL. NOW, HE ACCEPTS IT IS GOING TO BE BUILT. THAT IS GOOD.  NOW, WE WILL JUST MAKE A LITTLE DEAL AND YOU WILL PAY OTHERWISE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM. DON'T FORGET, THE $58 BILLION A YEAR DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL THE DRUGS THAT ARE POURING ACROSS AND POISONING AREOUR YOUTH. THE ONE THING I SAID TO THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE BECAUSE THEY WERE SO GOOD TO ME AND THE VICTORY WAS SO CONCLUSIVE. IT WAS MY FIRST VICTORY AS A POLITICIAN. SOME PEOPLE GIVE ME CREDIT. THEY SAID IT IS A PHENOMENON AND HE HAS NEVER DONE IT BEFORE. IT IS LIKE COMMON SENSE. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE THESE CROWDS. THAT IS WHY IT IS A MOVEMENT BECAUSE IT IS A MOVEMENT. WHEN I GO TO DALLAS, 21,000 PEOPLE. WE JUST LEFT NORTH CAROLINA WHERE I THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO GREAT. WE HAD A ROOM THAT HELD 2000 PEOPLE. IT WAS SET UP QUICKLY. THEY HAD BETWEEN 9000 AND 10,000 PEOPLE OUTSIDE LISTENING. WE HAD TO SEND THEM AWAY. THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON. OK, OK. HERE'S THE STORY -- WE ARE GOING TO DO THINGS THAT THE COUNTRY IS NOT USED TO DOING. IT IS CALLED WE ARE GOING TO WIN. IT IS VERY SIMPLE -- WIN. TO WANT TO READ YOU THIS BECAUSE I LOVE IT. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD IT. I LOVE DOING IT, I LOVE READING IT. IT WAS WRITTEN BY AL WILSON A LONG TIME AGO. IT WAS ACTUALLY A SONG. I THINK IT IS GREAT. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM WITH TERRORISM AND A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU AGREE WITH ME -- BUT WE CANNOT LET PEOPLE INTO OUR COUNTRY THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE, WHAT THEY ARE DOING, WHERE THEY ARE. THEY HAVE NO PAPERWORK CLEARED WE CANNOT DO. WE CANNOT DO IT. WE CAN BUILD IN SYRIA AND BUILD A SAFE ZONE. I WANT TO GET GULF STATES TO PAY SO MUCH MONEY THAT THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT. WE ARE PAYING FOR EVERYTHING. PEOPLE THINK WE SPEND A LOT ON OUR MILITARY. WE SPEND A LOT TAKING CARE OF ALL OF THESE RICH COUNTRIES THAT DO NOT REIMBURSE US PROPERLY. I LOVE SOUTH KOREA. I LOVE JAPAN, BUT JAPAN, IF WE GET ATTACKED, JAPAN DOES NOT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. IF JAPAN GETS ATTACKED, WE JUST STARTED WORLD WAR III. WHAT KIND OF DEALS ARE THESE? DON'T WORRY. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TERROR AND TERRORISM -- REMEMBER THIS POEM. WE TALKED ABOUT THE WRONG PEOPLE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY, RIGHT? WE CANNOT ALLOW IT. I LOVE YOU. LOOK AT THIS CROWD. I LOVE YOU.  THIS IS AMAZING. OK, ARE YOU READY? THIS IS CALLED ""THE SNAKE."" ON OUR WAY TO WORK ONE MORNING, DOWN THE PATH ALONG THE LAKE, A TENDERHEARTED WOMAN SAW A POOR, HALF FROZEN SNAKE. HER PRETTY COLORED SKIN HAD BEEN OFF ROSTER WITH THE DEW. OH, WELL, SHE CRIED, I WILL TAKE YOU IN AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU. TAKE ME IN, OH, TENDER WOMAN. TAKE ME IN, FOR HEAVENS SAKE. SIGHED THE BROKEN SNAKE. SHE WRAPPED HIM UP AND THEN LAID HIM BY THE FIRESIDE WITH HONEY AND SOME MILK. NOW SHE HURRIED HOME FROM WORK AT NIGHT. AS SOON IT SHE ARRIVED, SHE FOUND THAT PRETTY SNAKE SHE HAD TAKEN IN HAD BEEN REVIVED. HE WAS HAPPY. TAKE ME IN, OH, TENDER WOMAN. TAKE ME IN, FOR HEAVENS SAKE, SIGHED THE BROKEN SNAKE. NOW SHE CLUTCHED HIM TO HER BOSOM. YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL, SHE CRIED. IF I HAD NOT RUN YOU IN BY NOW, EVANS, YOU MIGHT HAVE DIED. NOW SHE STROKED HIS PRETTY SKIN AND THEN KISSED HIM AND HELD HIM TIGHT. INSTEAD OF SAYING THANK YOU, THAT SNAKE GAVE HER A VICIOUS BITE. TAKE ME IN, OH, TENDER WOMAN. TAKE ME IN, FOR HEAVENS SAKE. TAKE ME IN, OH, TENDER WOMAN, SIGHED THAT VICIOUS SNAKE. I SAVE YOU, CRIED THE WOMAN, AND YOU BIT ME, WHY? YOU KNOW YOUR BITE IS POISONOUS AND NOW I'M GOING TO DIE. OH, SHUT UP, SILLY WOMAN. , SAID THE REPTILE WITH A GRIN. YOU KNEW DAMN WELL I WAS A SNAKE BEFORE YOU TOOK ME IN.  RIGHT? RIGHT?    USA, USA. SO, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING, FOLKS, AND WE HAVE TO LEARN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO DO A FEW THINGS. THE MAIN THING I WANT YOU TO DO TONIGHT IS GO HOME, GO TO SLEEP, GET A GOOD REST, GO OUT TOMORROW. YOU HAVE TO BEAT KASICH. HE IS NOT GOING TO BE A GREAT PRESIDENT. HE IS NOT GOING TO BE STRONG. HE IS WEAK ON THE ORDERS. WHEN HE WAS A CONGRESSMAN, HE SIGNED NAFTA AND IT DESTROYED OHIO. NOW HE WANTS TO SIGN PPP. THAT IS GOING TO BE WORSE. I HAVE STUDIED IT SO CAREFULLY. THAT IS GOING TO BE WORSE FOR OHIO. IT WILL TAKE ALL OF YOUR CAR BUSINESS OUT. THE CAR BUSINESS IS GOING TO BE DESTROYED BY TPP AND HE WANTS IT. NOBODY KNOWS WHY HE WANTS IT, INCLUDING HIMSELF. MAYBE ONE OF HIS LOBBYISTS ARE DEMANDING IT. MAY BE THE SPECIAL INTERESTS FROM THE CARS OR SOMETHING ARE DEMANDING IT. MAY BE ONE OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE GOING TO BENEFIT ARE DEMANDING IT. WHO KNOWS? IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. THEN DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT MONETARY MANIPULATION. IT IS 6000 PAGES LONG. IT IS 12 COUNTRIES AT LEAST. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE TRADE AGREEMENTS. BOOM, BOO,M. DO THEM WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES THAT DESERVE IT. DON'T DO IT WITH A MASS GROUP. YOU WATCH. CHINA, THEY ARE WATCHING. THEY ARE NOT IN THE AGREEMENT NOW BUT THEY ARE WATCHING AND THEY WILL COME IN THROUGH THE BACK DOOR AT A LATER DATE AND TAKE IT OVER AND WILL CONTINUE TO LAUGH AT HOW STUPID OUR COUNTRY AND HOW STUPID OUR LEADERS ARE. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN IF ON THE I'M THE LEADER. IT WON'T HAPPEN.  I LOVE CHINA. I LOVE MEXICO. IT IS ALL GREAT. THEIR LEADERS ARE TOO SMART FOR OUR LEADERS. BANK OF CHINA. THINK OF CHINA. TRADE DEFICIT. $500 BILLION. I'M A COMMONSENSE PERSON AND I WOULD LIKE TO THINK ON THE COMMONSENSE PERSON. I'M VERY CONSERVATIVE ON THE MILITARY, WITH THE VETERANS. THE VETERANS WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF, FOLKS. BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE BY A FACTOR OF 10. I'M VERY CONSERVATIVE ON THE BORDER. NOBODY REMEMBER SHERIFF JOE. I'M CONSERVATIVE ON HEALTH CARE. THE SECOND AMENDMENT, WE WILL KEEP OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE, I LOVE FREE-TRADE. THAT IS GOOD IF YOU HAVE SMART PEOPLE. BUT, WE DON'T. WE HAVE THE OPPOSITE. I'M TRYING TO BE NICE. WE HAVE THE OPPOSITE. HERE IS THE STORY -- WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TRADE AGREEMENTS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE AGREEMENTS WHERE THEY ARE GOOD FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE. I'M CELL FUNDING MY OWN CAMPAIGN.  -- SELF FUNDING MY OWN CAMPAIGN. WHEN THAT BIG PLANE FLIES INTO OHIA,O, TRUMP IS PAYING FOR IT. IT IS EXPENSIVE. MADE IN THE USA -- IT IS CALLED BOEING. LOOK, I'M PAYING FOR IT. I'M SELF FUNDING. I DON'T KNOW IF I GET CREDIT FOR THAT. I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON THE CAMPAIGN. HERE IS A BEAUTY -- IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, I HAVE SPENT ABOUT $2.5 MILLION . OTHER PEOPLE SPENT ABOUT $58 MILLION AND CAME IN FIFTH OR SIXTH. WHO DO YOU WANT AS PRESIDENT? WOULNDDN'T IT BE NICE IF WE CAN SPEND THE LEAST AND GET THE BEST RESULT? WOULNDDN'T THAT BE NICE? IN EDUCATION IN THE WORLD, 30 COUNTRIES, THE UNITED STATES IS NUMBER 30, BUT IT IS NUMBER ONE ON COSTS. COSTS PER PUPIL. BY THE WAY, COST PER PUPIL IS NOT EVEN CLOSE. WE ARE SO MUCH HIGHER THAN NUMBER TWO THAT WE DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT NUMBER TWO. WE ARE NUMBER ONE ON COST AND THE WORST IN TERMS OF THE EDUCATION. YOU HAVE NORWAY, SWEDEN, DENMARK, CHINA. SOME COUNTRIES THAT U.N. NEVER HEARD OF BEFOR -- THAT YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE. WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE IT AROUND. WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE -- LET ME TELL YOU, I DON'T KNOW IF I GET CREDIT FOR SELF FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN, BUT THESE GUYS ARE NOT STUPID PEOPLE. HOW DO THEY MAKE A DEAL SO STUPID? THEIR LOBBYISTS TOLD THEM TO MAKE IT. THEY ARE TOTALLY CONTROLLED BY THE LOBBYISTS AND SPECIAL INTEREST. WHEN I TELL CARRIER, THAT JUST ANNOUNCED THEY ARE MOVING, THIS IS YOUR PRESIDENT. THIS IS NOT VERY PRESIDENTIAL. MY WIFE SAID AND IVANKA SAID -- HAS ANYBODY EVER HEARD OF IVANKA. THEY SAID YOU ARE DOING GREAT IN THE DEBATES, BUT ACT PRESIDENTIAL TONIGHT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? SHE SAID ACT PRESIDENTIAL. WHEN THEY COME AT YOU WITH THINGS, JUST STAND THERE AND ACT PRESIDENTIAL. I TOLD THIS TO THE PRESS. I CAN BE MORE PRESIDENTIAL THAN ANY PRESIDENT THE UNITED STATES HAS EVER HAD EXCEPT FOR HONEST ABE LINCOLN. HONEST ABE WAS SERIOUSLY PRESIDENTIAL. HONEST ABE, I DON'T THINK I CAN BEAT HIM. I HAVE NEVER SAID THAT BEFORE. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THAT MEANS WHEN THEY COME AT YOU -- I SAID I CANNOT DO THAT, BUT I DID. I WAS PROUD OF MYSELF AND I WON THAT DEBATE. , ACCORDING TO THE POLLS. LOOK, SO THEY SAY, ACT PRESIDENTIAL. THIS IS NOT PRESIDENTIAL. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- I'M MORE INTERESTED IN HAVING JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY THAN I AM IN ACTING PRESIDENTIAL. I HAVE CARL ICAHN, SOME OF THE GREATEST BUSINESS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE THE BEST NEGOTIATORS, BEST BUSINESS PEOPLE. I HAVE CARL ICAHN, GREAT PEOPLE. THIS IS TOO EASY. CARRIER ANNOUNCED THEY ARE GETTING RID OF 1400 JOBS. IO BUY CARRIER AIR-CONDITIONERS. I USED TO BE WE HAD SEEN ITS, RCA, GE, WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ANYMORE. THEY ARE ALL MADE OVER IN SOUTH KOREA. THEY ARE ALL MADE -- I ORDERED THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF TELEVISIONS. CAN WE BUY THEM IN THE U.S.? NO WEEKEND. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS WITH CARRIER. THEY ANNOUNCED THEY ARE MOVING AND I AM NOT HAPPY. BECAUSE WHAT DO WE GET OUT OF IT? THEY LAID OFF 1400 GREAT WORKERS WHO HELPED THE COMPANY. YOU SEE THESE PEOPLE, THEY ARE CRYING, THEY ARE DEVASTATED, THEY HAD A GREAT JOB. WE ARE MOVING TO MEXICO, I'M SORRY. WE ARE MOVING TO MEXICO. HERE'S WHAT I DO. I CALL UP THE HEAD OF CARRIER AND I SAY VERY NICELY AND WITH GREAT RESPECT, HELLO THIS IS DONALD TRUMP I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING MOVING CARRIER OUT OF THIS COUNTRY. AND HE WILL SAY, MR. PRESIDENT, -- REMEMBER THIS, HILLARY DOES NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH TO BE PRESIDENT. IF HILLARY IS PRESIDENT, HER SPECIAL INTERESTS WILL CALL HER, HER LOBBYISTS WILL CALL HER, HER FUNDRAISERS WILL CALL HER, AND SHE KNOWS IT IS A BETTING BUT SHE WILL NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. IF LITTLE MARKO GETS CALLED, 100% HE WILL DO WHATEVER HIS LOBBYISTS TELL HIM. THEY WILL SAY, MARCO YOU CAN'T DO THIS. THESE GUYS IS SUPPORTED YOU, THEY GIVE YOU $5 MILLION, AND HE IS GOING TO SAY OK. HE IS GOT LOBBYISTS. THE FORGET, IN HIS PERSONAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORM -- HE IS GOING TO BE ROBIN HOOD. HE IS PROTECTING EVERYONE FROM THE BIG BAD BANKS. BUT HE HAS LOANS FROM THE BIG BAD BANKS. HE FORGOT TO PUT HIS LOANS. HE FORGOT TO PUT HIS LOANS IN HIS DISCLOSURE FORMS. HE JUST FORGOT. HE FORGOT TO SAY TO THE INTEREST RATE IS SO LOW THAT YOU ARE PRACTICALLY NOT PAYING ANY INTEREST. WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO HAVE LYING TED'S INTEREST RATE? SO THE TRUTH IS THEY ARE TOTALLY CONTROLLED 100% AND YOU CAN PRACTICALLY GO TO WASHINGTON, IT WILL TELL YOU, WHO IS THE ROBBIE IS FOR RUBIO? OH, THIS ONE, THIS ONE. WITH ME, NO LOBBYISTS. I HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO EVERYBODY, I PUT IN THE GREATEST PERSONAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, ALMOST 100 PAGES. AN UNBELIEVABLE COMPANY, TREMENDOUS CASH FLOW. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THAT WAS BAD? YOU HAVE HEARD FROM THOSE GUYS, THEY ARE SO UPSET AT HOW GOOD IT IS. I BUILT A GREAT COMPANY. THEY ARE DEVASTATED, THEY ARE SO DISHONEST AND DISGUSTING. THERE ARE DEVASTATED. HERE'S A STORY. HERE'S A STORY -- ONLY BECAUSE -- THE RECENT I WANT TO DO IT MYSELF IS BECAUSE I LOVE TO DO IT MYSELF. I WILL GET THE PRESIDENT ON THE PHONE, LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING MR. PRESIDENT OF CARRIER. HERE'S THE STORY, ARE YOU READY? THIS APPLIES TO FORWARD, TO NABISCO WHO IS MOVING TO MEXICO AND I'M NOT EATING OREOS ANYMORE. SO, HERE IS THE STORY. I SAY THAT IT IS JUST TOO EASY TO NOT DO IT MYSELF. I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE CALLING UP COMPANIES, BUT I'M GOING TO DO IT. SO, HERE'S THE STORY. I'M GOING TO TELL HIM, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR MOVE, I HOPE YOU BUILD A BEAUTIFUL FACILITY. GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR EMPLOYEES, THE 4000 PEOPLE THAT WERE FIRED ARE ALL DEVASTATED AND RIGHT NOW THEY ARE WORKING PART-TIME JOBS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET GOOD JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY. SO, GOOD LUCK WITH YOU, I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU ONE THING BEFORE I HANG UP. EVERY AIR-CONDITIONING UNIT THAT IS MADE BY CARRIER THAT CROSSES OUR NOW VERY STRONG BORDER IS GOING TO BE TAXED AT THE RATE OF 35% FOR YOU PER UNIT. ALL RIGHT?   EVERY SINGLE ONE. WITH THE OTHER GUYS, YOU'LL GET ONE OF THE LOBBYISTS AND THEY WILL FORGET. HERE'S WHAT THEY WILL SAY. ESTHER PRESIDENT, -- I WILL GET A CALL WITHIN 24 HOURS. THIS ISN'T LIKE, 95%. THIS IS 100%. I WILL GET A CALL AND HE WILL SAY MR. PRESIDENT, CARRIER HAS DECIDED TO STAY IN THE UNITED STATES. 100%. AND MAYBE THEY WILL BUILD A NEW PLANT AND MAYBE A NEW FACTORY, AND MAYBE THEY WILL DO LOTS OF THINGS AND I DON'T CARE WHERE THEY BUILD IT AS LONG AS IT IS IN OUR COUNTRY, RIGHT? BUT THEY ARE STAYING, AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THESE OTHER COUNTRIES MANIPULATE THEIR CURRENCIES. THESE COUNTRIES ARE MANIPULATING THEIR CURRENCIES, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ALL OF YOU TO COMPETE IN FOR YOUR COMPANY TO COMPETE. THAT IS WHY YOU ARE CLOSING UP COMPANIES ALL OVER OHIO. THAT IS WHY THE STEEL INDUSTRY IS A DISASTER. I WILL BRING IT BACK. THAT IS WHY THE COAL INDUSTRY IN OHIO IS A DISASTER. I WILL BRING YOUR INDUSTRY BACK. YOU WILL HAVE CLEAN COAL WHETHER YOU ARE IN KENTUCKY OR WEST VIRGINIA OR OHIO. WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK AND WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY NOW, AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE CLEAN COAL. YOUR CALL INDUSTRY IS DEAD, YOUR STEEL INDUSTRY IS DEAD. YOUR GOVERNOR IS TOTALLY OVERRATED. HE HASN'T DONE A THING AND WITHOUT OIL YOU WOULD BE IN WORSE SHAPE THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE UNION, BAILEY ME. -- BELIEVE ME. SO, I AM GOING TO ASK YOU TO GET UP TOMORROW AND VOTE. AND I WILL TELL YOU THE BOTTOM LINE. YOU ARE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY, YOU ARE GOING TO BE REMEMBERING THIS EVENING, AND YOU ARE GOING TO SAY THIS WAS THE SINGLE GREATEST BOAT I HAVE EVER CAST. YOU WILL BE PROUD OF YOUR PRESIDENT. I'M YOU, I'M YOU. YOU WILL BE PROUD OF YOUR PRESIDENT, SO PROUD OF YOUR COUNTRY. AND WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH OUR MILITARY. NOBODY IS GOING TO PLAY GAMES WITH US, NOBODY IS GOING TO MESS WITH US. WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH OUR VETS. WE ARE GOING TO FINALLY TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS. WE ARE GOING TO WIN AT THE BORDER, WIN WITH THE SECOND AMENDMENT, WHEN WITH GETTING RID OF COMMON CORE. WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH HEALTH CARE, WE ARE GOING TO TERMINATE OBAMACARE. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS SO MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE AND SO MUCH BETTER. WE ARE GOING TO WIN, WIN, WIN. WE ARE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH YOU ARE GOING TO BE SO PROUD OF YOUR COUNTRY AGAIN. I LOVE YOU OHIO. YOU CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. TELL YOUR FRIENDS, BOTH FOR TRUMP. I PROMISE YOU I AM GOING TO DO SUCH A GREAT JOB.

HE IS THE BEST. NUMBER ONE IN HIS POSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NICK, I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  WHAT A GOOD GUY. OHIO.  I LOVE OHIO. I LOVE OHIO.  YOU KNOW, I WORKED IN OHIO CINCINNATI. I LOVE CINCINNATI.  I HAD AN EARLY EXPERIENCE, IT  WAS A JOB, I BOUGHT IT WITH MY  FATHER. IT WORKED OUT REALLY WELL. I STAYED HERE. IRAN THE JOB MYSELF.  I WAS VERY YOUNG. I SELL GOODS, AND THAT'S  GOOD.  IT IS LIKE GETTING YOUR FIRST  HOME RUN AT BADA. THE PEOPLE ARE AMAZING PEOPLE.  THANK YOU, I LOVE YOU.   I DON'T KNOW IF THE MEDIA IS  GETTING THIS. HERE, WE HAVE A FULL HANGAR.  THIS IS A BIG, BIG HANGAR.  WE FIGURED THE CROWD WOULD BE OK .  WE HAVE SO MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EXTRA THAT WE HAD TO PUT  THEM OUT IN THE RUNWAY, RIGHT?   THEY NEVER WANT TO CAPTURE THAT,  JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND.  IT IS REALLY FANTASTIC. LET'S ADDRESS -- THANK YOU,  DARLING, I LOVE YOU TOO,  DARLING. LET'S ADDRESS YESTERDAY, SHOULD  WE?  YES. LOOK. WE HAD A TREMENDOUS RALLY IN  CHICAGO PLANNED. WE WERE GOING TO HAVE OVER  25,000 PEOPLE.  THE ARENA WITH SEATING FOR ABOUT  11,000.  WHAT WE DID --   THAT'S ALL RIGHT.  THAT'S OK. YOU ARE LOYAL TO OTHER PLACES,  THAT'S OK.  WHAT HAPPENED -- IT WAS VERY  INTERESTING -- THESE WERE GREAT  PEOPLE, PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELVES, PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  THAT'S ALL IT IS.  THEY WERE POURING INTO THE  ARENA, GOOD ARENA, EVERYTHING  NICE. THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, A PLANNED ATTACK CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.  IF YOU LOOK AT THE POSTERS, ALL  DONE BY A GROUP, VERY  PROFESSIONALLY DONE.  A DISGRACE, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW  THE TRUTH.  THEY WERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. FORTUNATELY, WE WERE ABLE TO LET  A LOT OF THEM KNOW, DON'T GO.  BE WOULD HAVE HAD A PROBLEM,  LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE BELIEVED. BAIG NICK WOULD HAVE BEEN IN  THERE, AND NOT THEM OUT.  WE HAD TO MAKE A DECISION. FRANKLY, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN  EASIER TO GO, BUT I DID NOT WANT  TO SEE ANYONE TO GET HURT. THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A PROBLEM LIKE THEY HAVE NOT SEEN IN A  LONG TIME.  WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO AMAZING.  THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY LOYAL TO  ME, LOYAL TO THE COUNTRY. WE WANT TO SEE THINGS HAPPEN. THEY ARE LOYAL TO THE COUNTRY.  USA IS RIGHT. THEY ARE LOYAL TO THE COUNTRY.  THEY WANT GREAT SECURITY, THEY  WANT GREAT MILITARY, THEY WANT  TO TAKE CARE OF THE VETS, THEY WANT A BORDER, THEY WANT A WALL.   WE ARE GOING TO  BUILD THAT WALL, FOLKS, DON'T  WORRY.  WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE  WALL?  DO WE HAVE A GOOD TIME?  IT'S INTERESTING, I WATCHED LITTLE MARCO AND LYIN ' TED CRUZ. HE HOLDS UP THE BIBLE, THEN HE  PUTS IT DOWN, AND LIES. EVEN RUBIO SAID, HE IS A LIAR,  HE LIES ABOUT EVERYTHING. I HAVE THE EVANGELICAL VOTE. I HAVE HAD GREAT SUPPORT FROM EVERYBODY -- SARAH PALIN -- WE  HAVE SUCH UNBELIEVABLE SUPPORT. I HAVE THE EVANGELICAL VOTE. I WON SOUTH CAROLINA, WE DID SO  WELL. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO WIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA, BUT WE GOT THE EVANGELICALS.  YOU KNOW WHY?  THEY DON'T LIKE LIARS.   THEY SAID, AS I  WAS COMING IN, I WAS WATCHING,  AND THEY SAID, AT OUR RALLIES,  WE WOULD NEVER HAVE ANYTHING  LIKE THAT.  THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING AT  THEIR RALLIES, FOLKS. NOBODY THERE. NOBODY CARES. IF THEY HAD THIS HANGAR,  THEY WOULD HAVE ABOUT FOUR  PEOPLE OVER THERE IN THE CORNER  OFFICE. THEY SAY, ""WHY DO NOT HAVE MORE TOWN HALL MEETINGS?"" TOO MANY PEOPLE, I CAN'T HAVE THEM. I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO HAVE A COUPLE OF TOWN HALL MEETINGS,  BUT WE WOULD HAVE TO TURN  A WAY, HOW MANY PEOPLE? 45,000? WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY WAS  INCREDIBLE.  WE DEALT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT SO  GOOD. WE LOVE OUR POLICE.  WE DEALT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AT EVERY LEVEL.  SECRET SERVICE, GRADE. IT WAS DETERMINED, IF WE GO IN,  IT COULD CAUSE REALLY BAD VIBES.  THEY WANT ME TO TELL MY PEOPLE,  BE NICE.  MY PEOPLE WERE SO NICE.  LET ME TELL YOU, THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE THAT CAME THERE, WERE  INVITED, THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, THEY CAUSED NO  PROBLEM. THEY WERE HARASSED BY THESE  OTHER PEOPLE. SOME OF THEM REPRESENTED BERNIE, ARE COMMUNIST FRIEND.   THERE WERE NOT TOO  MANY HILLARY PEOPLE THERE.  YOU KNOW WHY? IN ALL FAIRNESS TO BERNIE, THE  REASON THAT WERE NOT HILLARY  PEOPLE, THEY HAVE NO FERVOR. SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT BERNIE,  AT LEAST HAVE A LITTLE FERVOR,  RIGHT?  HE SHOULD REALLY GET UP AND SAY  TO HIS PEOPLE, STOP.  NOT ME.  STOP. THEY SAID, MR. TRUMP SHOULD GET  UP THIS MORNING, AND TELL HIS  PEOPLE TO BE NICE.  MY PEOPLE ARE NICE, FOLKS. THEY ARE GREAT.  MY PEOPLE ARE GREAT. HERE IS THE STORY. WE GET UP. I MAKE THE DECISION, AND THE PEOPLE AND AUDIENCE WERE REALLY  DEVASTATED.  SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE GOT THERE, LIKE YOU, EIGHT HOURS EARLY. LIKE YOU. RAISE YOUR HAND.  WE LOVE YOU PEOPLE. DON'T WORRY, I WILL SIGN AUTOGRAPHS. DON'T LET THEM RIP YOU AWAY FROM THAT POSITION. THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN REVIEW OF WAY IS -- REVIEWIP YOU AWAY IS NICK. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE REALLY ON  THE OTHER SIDE, MOVEON.ORG, OR  ONE OF THESE GROUPS -- THAT  GROUPS, BAD PEOPLE. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT TRULY  DON'T WANT TO SEE OUR COUNTRY BE  GREAT AGAIN.  I'M TELLING YOU THAT. WE WANT TO GET ALONG WITH EVERYBODY. WE CAN UNIFY THE COUNTRY.  OUR PRESIDENT HAS D DIVIDED THIS COUNTRY SO BAD.  I CALL HIM THE GREAT DIVIDER. WHEN HE GOT ELECTED ORIGINALLY,  I SAID, I DON'T THINK HE WILL BE  A VERY GOOD PRESIDENT, WHO KNOWS? FRANKLY, I WISH I DID NOT HAVE TO DO THIS.  I WHICH WE HAVE THE RIGHT  PEOPLE.  WE HAVE TO. WE HAVE NO CHOICE. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE IRAN DEAL,  THE HORRIBLE TRADE DEALS, LOSING  A FORTUNE TO EVERY COUNTRY BE DO  BUSINESS WITH, OUR JOBS ARE BEING SUCKED AWAY, IT IS  UNBELIEVABLE WHAT IS HAPPENING.  OUR MILITARY CANNOT DEFEAT ISIS,  OUR VETERANS ARE BEING TREATED  HORRIBLY, OUR BORDER IS LIKE A  PIECE OF SWISS CHEESE.  WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS ANYMORE. LET ME JUST TELL YOU.  ON TOP OF THAT, WE HAVE A DIVIDED COUNTRY. BLACK, WHITE, AND EVERYBODY  HATES EVERYBODY. EVEN CONGRESS. LOOK AT CONGRESS. POLITICIANS HATE EACH OTHER. DEMOCRATS HATE REPUBLICANS.  LIBERALS HATE CONSERVATIVES. WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR THINKING. IF THERE IS A GROUP OUT THERE,  JUST THROW THEM THE HELL OUT. THAT'S OK.    LOOK, WE CANNOT  LET OUR FIRST AMENDMENT -- WE  JUST CAN'T -- WE CANNOT LET OUR  FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS BE TAKEN  AWAY FROM US, WE CAN'T.  WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN.  WE HAVE A RIGHT TO SPEAK. WE ARE LAW ABIDING PEOPLE.  WE ARE PEOPLE THAT WORK REALLY HARD.  WE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BUILT  THIS COUNTRY AND MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT.  WE WANT TO GET ALONG WITH  EVERYBODY.  WHEN THEY HAVE ORGANIZED PROFESSIONALLY STAGED GUYS, WE  HAVE TO FIGHT BACK. WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT BACK.    TO HAVE ANYBODY? -- DO YOU HAVE ANYBODY? HELLO. YOU KNOW, I LOVE THE PROTESTERS  BECAUSE IT SHOWS WHAT IS  HAPPENING. THE MEDIA -- BY THE WAY, THE  MOST DISHONEST GROUP OF PEOPLE I  HAVE EVER MET. THE WORST. THEY WILL SAY TODAY, DONALD TRUMP CAME TO DAYTON, AND HE  HAD A SMALL CROWD, A SMATTERING OF PEOPLE -- SMITHERRING OF  PEOPLE. THEY WILL SAY A SMALL CROWD, OR REPRESENTATIVE CROWD, WHAT?  15 PEOPLE? BUT ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, WE  HAVE AMAZING PEOPLE IN THIS  COUNTRY.  I'M SO IMPRESSED WITH THE PEOPLE  OF THIS COUNTRY.  WE WILL START MAKING APPLE PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES.  NOT CHINA. WHEN CARRIER AIR CONDITIONERS SAY THEY ARE LEAVING THE UNITED  STATES BECAUSE THEY WILL BUILD  IN MEXICO, AND FORD WILL BUILD IN MEXICO, AND NABISCO IS  LEAVING CHICAGO BECAUSE THEY  WILL BUILD IN MEXICO, NOT WITH ME.  WE WILL KEEP OUR BUSINESSES HERE . LET ME TELL YOU.  WHILE WE ARE ON THE SUBJECT, LET  ME TALK ABOUT YOUR GOVERNOR.  YOU MIGHT? -- DO YOU MIND? IT IS A BORING SUBJECT, BUT WE  WILL TALK ABOUT HIM ANYWAY.  LOOK, HE WAS THE MANAGING  DIRECTOR OF LEHMAN BROTHERS, ONE OF THE GREAT CATASTROPHES IN THE  HISTORY OF THIS WORLD. THE MEN BROTHERS FAILED -- LEHMAN BROTHERS FAILED, AND JOHN  KASICH WAS A MANAGING DIRECTOR, RIGHT IN THERE, DEALING WITH THE BOYS, MAKING THE HORRIBLE DECISIONS. ANOTHER THING.  HE VOTED FOR NAFTA. YOU PEOPLE FORGOT. HE WAS A CONGRESSMAN. HE VOTED FOR NAFTA. NAFTA HAS DESTROYED NEW ENGLAND. YOU HAVE FOUGHT FOR YEARS AND YEARS, AND YOU WILL NEVER RECOVER COMPLETELY FROM IT, BUT YOU WILL, IF I AM ELECTED  BECAUSE WE ARE BRINGING THOSE  BUSINESSES BACK. NAFTA, PUTTING A VOTE UP -- ANYONE WHO PUTS A VOTE UP FOR  NAFTA -- CLINTON SIGNED THE  BILL, BUT IT WIPED OUT STATES.  IT WIPED OUT NEW ENGLAND.  IT HAS TAKEN YEARS AND YEARS.  YOU LOOK AT THE FACTORS.  IT IS ALL WONDERFUL, BUT WE NEED  JOBS. WE DO NOT HAVE JOBS ANYMORE. OUR JOBS ARE GOING TO CHINA, TO JAPAN, TO MEXICO, TO VIETNAM. WE ARE LOSING OUR JOBS.  WE ARE LOSING OUR MANUFACTURER  S. WE ARE LOSING AT EVERY SINGLE ITEM, WHETHER IT IS HEALTH CARE OR TRADE.  TO BE HAVE GREAT MILITARY, RIGHT? WE HAVE A PROBLEM. OUR MILITARY CANNOT BEAT ISIS.  I KNOW WE COULD NOT THEM OUT IN  TWO DAYS, IF WE WANTED TO.  YOU KNOW WHAT, I CALLER SELVES  THE POLITICALLY CORRECT OR MORE T WARRIORS. HAVE I BEEN SAYING FOR FOUR  YEARS, HIT THE OIL, HIT THE OIL. I HAVE BEEN SAYING IT FOR YEARS. I ALSO SAID, DON'T GO INTO IRAQ,  WE WILL DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE  EAST. I SAID IT LOUD AND CLEAR.  I SAID, DON'T GO INTO IRAQ.  IT TURNS OUT THAT IRAQ -- IN ALL  FAIRNESS, THEY DID NOT HAVE  WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.  I'M NOT SAYING I KNEW THAT, BY  SAID FOR OTHER REASONS, DON'T GO  IN. WE HAVE DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST.  ALL THE THINGS YOU SEE RIGHT  NOW, THAT WAS ONE OF THE WORST  DECISIONS MADE. THEN, PRESIDENT OBAMA, HE MADE  IT WORSE. WHAT HE DID, INSTEAD OF SLOWLY GETTING OUT, AND NOT THING WHEN, KEEPING SOME SOLDIERS THERE -- WHAT HE DOES, HE ANNOUNCES A DATE. THE OTHER SIDE IS LOOKING,  AND SAID, I CAN'T BELIEVE HE  GAVE US A DATE, IT MUST BE -- THEY PULLED BACK. A FEW MONTHS AGO, HE SAID, WE  ARE SENDING 50 SOLDIERS IN.  WHY CAN'T WE BE UNPREDICTABLE IN  MORE?  IT IS LIKE THESE DISHONEST  PEOPLE BACK THERE -- THEY ARE  SAYING, WHAT WOULD YOU DO ABOUT  ISIS?  THEY WANT ME TO LAY OUT MY PLAN.  I WANTED TO KNOCK THE CRAP OUT  OF THE OIL.  BUT, I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT. I WANT TO SURPRISE THE ENEMY. UNPREDICTABILITY. GENERAL DOUGLAS MCARTHUR, I HAD  GREAT RESPECT FOR GENERAL GEORGE PATTON.  YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING NOW?  THEY ARE SPINNING IN THEIR  GRAVES AS WE ANNOUNCE EVERY  SINGLE MOVE. WE ANNOUNCED A FEW MONTHS AGO,  WE ARE SENDING 50 SOLDIERS. THESE ARE VERY ELITE PEOPLE, VERY TALENTED PEOPLE.  THEY, RIGHT NOW, HAVE A TARGET  ON THEIR BACK BECAUSE OF THE  ANNOUNCEMENT. WHY DON'T YOU SEND THEM IN, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT, AND LET THEM DO THEIR JOB.  LET ME JUST GO OVER A COUPLE OF THINGS WHEN JOHN KASICH, AND WE  WILL BE DONE.  HE IS NOT THE RIGHT GUY TO BE  PRESIDENT. HE IS NOT TOUGH ENOUGH.  HE IS NOT SHARP ENOUGH.  IN MY OPINION -- MAY BE WINS  OHIO, MAYBE HE DOESN'T. HE IS VERY WEAK ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.  HE IS TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF  AMNESTY, WHICH YOU CANNOT BE IN  FAVOR OF. LOOK, EITHER WE HAVE A COUNTRY,  OR WE DON'T. HE IS VERY VERY WEAK ON ILLEGAL  IMMIGRATION, AND HE WANTS AMNESTY.  HE HAS WANTED IT ALWAYS. HE TALKS ABOUT IT. AS FAR AS CARS, EVERYTHING YOU  HAVE RIGHT NOW, THE INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN TAKEN OUT OF  OHIO, HERE IS WHAT WE HAVE TO  DO.  WE HAVE TO PROTECT YOUR COAL  INDUSTRY, WHICH IS GETTING DECIMATED.  WE HAVE TO PROTECT YOUR STEEL INDUSTRY.  IT IS BEING DECIMATED. YOUR GOVERNOR IS IN FAVOR OF THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP, WHICH  IS A DISASTER. BY THE WAY, I'M TELLING YOU, IT  IS A DISASTER. DID I DO WELL IN THE DEBATE, OR WHAT?  I ACTUALLY LIKE DEBATING THE  OTHER WAY BETTER.  THEY CAME TO MEET. EVEN MY DAUGHTER, SHE SAID, DAD,  YOU ARE THE SMARTEST ONE UP  THERE, BUT YOU HAVE TO ACT PRESIDENTIAL -- DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE OFF MY COAT, THE WEATHER IS SO BEAUTIFUL?  SHE SAID, DAD, YOU  HAVE TO ACT PRESIDENTIAL. YOU ARE DOING SO WELL, BUT DON'T FALL FOR IT, WHEN THEY ATTACK  YOU, DON'T FALL FOR IT.  HERE'S MY PROBLEM.  YOU HAVE LITTLE MARCO SAYING ALL  SORTS OF THINGS -- WHICH WERE  TRUE, BY THE WAY. WERE NOT TRUE. NOT AS BIG AS NICK, BUT BIGGER THAN MOST. WHEN HE WAS CHOKING LIKE A DOG,  I WAS GETTING READY TO TAKE THAT HAND AND HOLD HIM UP, BECAUSE I  THOUGHT HE WAS GOING DOWN WITH  CHRIS CHRISTIE, WHO ENDORSED ME,  BY THE WAY.  AND BEN CARSON YESTERDAY ENDORSED ME.  YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING.  I GOT A CALL FROM SOME STRONG  EVANGELICALS YESTERDAY. THEY SAID, WE WERE TEETERING ON  YOU A LITTLE BIT -- WE WERE SORT  OF THERE, BUT MAYBE WE WERE NOT  GOING TO GET -- THERE AS SOON AS  BEN CARSON AND DOORS TO YOU, WE  WERE THERE, WE SUPPORT YOU 100%. I WANT TO THANK BEN. LOOK, AND YOUR COAL INDUSTRY,  YOUR STEEL INDUSTRY, ALL THESE INDUSTRIES ARE UNDER SIEGE.  THE EPA, THEY ARE DISASTER, WHAT  THEY ARE DOING. WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH OHIO,  THEY ARE A COMPLETE DISASTER. TRANSPACIFIC IS GOING TO DESTROY  YOUR AUTO INDUSTRY. THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE IT AWAY  FROM YOU, JUST LIKE YOU ARE A BUNCH OF BABIES.  IT WILL NOT HAPPEN IF I AM PRESIDENT.  IT WILL NOT HAPPEN.  IT IS A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE TRADE  AGREEMENT. YOU HAVE 12 COUNTRIES, ALL OF WHOM WANT TO RIP OUR HEART OUT. YOU HAVE CHINA, WHO IS NOT A  PART OF IT, BUT WANTS TO BE A PART. EACH COUNTRY KNOWS EVERY WORD OF THAT DOCUMENT, AND OUR  CONGRESSMEN AND SENATORS HAVE NEVER EVEN LOOKED AT IT OR READ IT.  WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IT SAYS.  THE MOST IMPORTANT WEAPON THEY  HAVE TO DESTROY TRADE IS MONETARY MANIPULATION, AND  EVALUATION OF THEIR CURRENCY. THEY ARE GRANDMASTERS. THE GREATEST OF ALL-TIME TIME IS  CHINA. MEXICO IS GETTING REALLY GOOD AT IT.  JAPAN IS A TOTAL PROFESSIONAL. WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH THE YEN , AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH US , WITH THE CARS, IT IS INCREDIBLE.  IT HAS TO STOP. YOU GO OVER TO LOS ANGELES, YOU SEE THE BOATS -- NASCAR, BRIAN FRANCE, THEY ENDORSED TRUMP. MANY OF THE DRIVERS -- WE HAVE  SUCH GREAT PEOPLE UP THERE, YOU , INCLUDING CHASE  ELLIOTT, AND HIS FATHER. GREAT GROUP. THEY GET IT. REALLY SMART PEOPLE.  WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR INDUSTRY. THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO DO TPP.  HE'S GOT TO TAKE IT AWAY. TPP -- OHIO IS A TARGET OF TPP. YOU WILL LOSE YOUR AUTO INDUSTRY  ENTIRELY.  YOU HAVE TO GET IT STOPPED. WITH ALL OF THAT BEING SAID, YOU  HAVE A GOVERNOR THAT HONESTLY, IF YOU DID NOT HIT OIL, OHIO WOULD BE A DISASTER RIGHT NOW. YOU GOT LUCKY.  WE ARE SITTING ON TOP OF OIL,  FOLKS. LIKE SAUDI ARABIA GOT LUCKY.  BY THE WAY, WE PROTECT SAUDI  ARABIA.  THEY WERE MAKING A BILLION DOLLARS A DAY.  THEY PAY US PEANUTS, LIKE WE ARE INTEGERS -- INDENTURED SERVANTS. THE PROBLEM WITH OHIO, BY THE  WAY, NOW THAT OIL IS DOWN, YOU  HAVE BIG PROBLEMS COMING. YOU HAVE, IN THE UNITED STATES, 35%-30 6%, THE BUDGET OF OHIO.  YOU ARE RELYING ON THE OIL, BUT  YOU CANNOT RELY ON OHIO ANYMORE BECAUSE THERE ARE PROBLEMS. BE CAREFUL. YOU MADE A LOT OF MONEY WITH  OIL, YOU WERE LUCKY AS HELL. YOU DO NOT HAVE THE OIL FACTOR SO MUCH ANYMORE BECAUSE OF THE PRICE. SAUDI ARABIA, IF YOU LOOK AT ALL  OF THESE COUNTRIES -- NOBODY RICHER RELATIVELY SENT SAUDI  ARABIA.  THEY MAKE A BILLION DOLLARS A  DAY.  ANYTIME THERE IS A THREAT, WE  SEND OVER THE PLANES -- TO START THE BATTLESHIPS, BOOM, $1 MILLION DOWN THE DRAIN.  WE SPENT BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PROTECTING WEALTHY  COUNTRIES. WE ARE NOT A WEALTHY COUNTRY. BEWE OWE OVER A TRILLION  DOLLARS.  OUR COUNTRY IS WEAK. IT HAS TO CHANGE.  THIS WHOLE THING OF TORTURE, I  DON'T WANT TORTURE, NO ONE LIKES  TORTURE.  WE ARE DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO  ARE ANIMALS. WE ARE DEALING WITH PEOPLE, IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THAT CHOP OFF  HEADS, DROWNED PEOPLE IN HEAVY STEEL CAGES, AND DROP THEM IN THE WATER, AND HOLD THEM FOR ONE HOUR, AND PULL THEM BACK UP ALL  DEAD, AND PUT ANOTHER 50 BACK IN .  WE ARE DEALING WITH ANIMALS.  THE QUESTION WAS ASKED -- THEY  WENT TO TED CRUZ, ON MY LEFT -- BY THE WAY, I HAVE BEEN IN THE  CENTER OF EVERY DEBATE SINCE THE BEGINNING.   I NEVER DID THIS BEFORE.  I NEVER DEBATED BEFORE. ONE OF THE WISEGUYS BACK  THEIR SAID, YOU KNOW, THE AMAZING THING ABOUT TRUMP IS HE  IS NOT A POLITICIAN, HE HAS ONLY  DONE THIS FOR EIGHT ONCE, AND HE IS KILLING EVERYBODY. I LIKE THAT. I STILL BELIEVE IN CONFIDENCE OVER EXPERIENCE. AND YET, I HAVE GREAT EXPERIENCE.  I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THE  OTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATION FOR A  LONG TIME.  NO ONE KNOWS POLITICIANS LIKE I  DO.  NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT ALL OF THE  THINGS LIKE PACCS AND FUNDING.  I HATE TO SAY THIS.  I WAS VERY ESTABLISHMENT NINE  MONTHS AGO. THEN, I SAW HOW STUPID EVERYBODY  WAS.  I SAID, I WILL BECOME VERY ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT, AND I SAID I  WOULD RUN.  THE ESTABLISHMENT SAID, DO YOU  BELIEVE THIS, TRUMP IS RUNNING,  THIS IS BAD, HE IS SELF FUNDING HIS CAMPAIGN, WE WILL NOT BE  ABLE TO CONTROL HIM, WE HAVE TO  FIGHT HIM.  I KNOW WHAT HAS TO BE DONE.  JUST TO FINISH ON TORTURE -- I  LOVE HOPPING AROUND -- SOME  PEOPLE SAID IT IS LIKE A GREAT CHESS GAME, YOU GO HERE, BUT YOU NEVER FORGET.  WE WERE AT TORTURE. I WANT TO JUST TELL YOU, THEY ASKED TED CRUZ A QUESTION ON WATERBOARDING.  HERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE LITTLE EVIL TIMES -- JAMES FOLEY, THAT WAS THE BEGINNING -- SO MANY  WONDERFUL PEOPLE.  A LOT OF CHRISTIANS. ANYBODY GETS IN THEIR WAY, BOOM,  CHOP UP THEIR HEAD.  YOU HAVE TO STOP THAT.  WE CANNOT ALLOW THAT. IN OUR WORLD, WE CANNOT ALLOW  THAT.  WE SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE THERE.  NOW, WE HAVE TO STOP IT. WE HAVE TO GO IN, AND NOT THE  HEALTH -- KNOCK THE HELL OUT  OF THEM. THEY ASKED TED CRUZ, RIGHT HERE,  ON MY LEFT. YOU KNOW, HE IS A NICE GUY, BUT  HE LIE SO MUCH -- LIES SO MUCH. THEY SAID, WATERBOARDING, WHAT DO YOU THINK? HE SAID, I DON'T KNOW, LET ME GO BACK AND TALK TO MY CONSULTANTS. THEY ARE ALL AFRAID OF BEING POLITICALLY CORRECT. THEN, THEY GO TO ME, BECAUSE HE DID NOT GIVE AN ANSWER -- HE IS  A GREAT DEBATER, BUT HE HAS A  LOUSY TALKER. HE CAN'T TALK. GREAT DEBATER -- WELL, I DON'T  KNOW IF HE IS A GREAT DEBATER, I  THINK I BEAT HIM AND ALL THE DEBATES. IF YOU LOOK BACK, LIKE THREE  DEBATES AGO, HE GAVE A NON-, HE  DIDN'T LIKE THAT QUESTION. THEY CAME TO ME. YOU KNOW, I HAVE MUCH MORE MONEY THAN ALL OF THEM PUT TOGETHER,  INCLUDING ALL OF THEIR PACS.  I DON'T HAVE A POLLSTER, I DON'T NEED A POLLSTER.  ANYWAY, THEY SPEND HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS OF POSTERS -- POLLSTERS.  THEY CAME TO ME, AND SAID, WHAT  DO YOU THINK ABOUT  WATERBOARDING? IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THEY ARE  CHOPPING OFF HEADS, DROWNING PEOPLE, THEY WOULD KILL US SO  QUICKLY IF THEY HAD THE  CAPABILITY, AND THEY ARE TRYING  TO GET THE CAPABILITY, WHICH IS WHY, BY THE WAY, WE HAVE TO KILL  THEM.  IF THERE WERE MASSIVE WEAPONRY AVAILABLE TODAY, I WOULD SAY COMING GET OUT. GO BACK 15 YEARS, WE WERE MUCH  BETTER OFF 15 YEARS AGO.  IF SADDAM HUSSEIN WERE IN CHARGE -- BAD GUY -- THE GUY WAS HORRIBLE. PUTIN CALLED ME A GENIUS, HE  SAID, DONALD TRUMP IS A GENIUS. PUTIN SAID GOOD THINGS ABOUT ME,  HE IS A LEADER, NOTE RUSSIAN  ABOUT IT. THEY ALL SAID -- THE MEDIA -- YOU SAW IN THE DEBATE -- THEY SAID, YOU ADMIRE PRESIDENT PUTIN . I DON'T ADMIRE HIM, I SAID HE IS  A STRONG LEADER, WHICH HE IS.  HE MIGHT BE BACK, HE MIGHT BE  GOOD. WELL, YOU SAID THE CHINESE, THEY  WERE RIGHT -- RIGHT? NO, I SAID THEY PUT DOWN A RIOT,  VICIOUSLY, STRONGLY. I DID NOT SAY THEY WERE RIGHT.  IF I DID NOT HAVE A BIG SPEAKER SYSTEM -- MY MOUTH -- AND TWITTER -- IT IS SO GREAT, THIS  TWITTER AND FACEBOOK. WHEN THEY LIE ON TELEVISION, I  TYPE OUT -- I DO IT MYSELF -- AND 12 SECONDS LATER, ""WE HAVE  BREAKING NEWS FROM DONALD TRUMP."" I WAS WATCHING CNN BEFORE. I TYPED OUT THAT JOHN KASICH  WITHOUT OIL WOULD BE NOTHING IN  OHIO -- ALL OF A SUDDEN, ""WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS."" IN THE OLD DAYS, IT WOULD HAVE  TAKEN YEARS TO GET THE WORD OUT.  GREAT STUFF.  WE HAVE TO GET STRONG AND SMART.  THEY ASKED ABOUT TORTURE. HE TOOK A PASS.  THEY ASKEDIN THE OLD DAYS, IT WOULD HAVE  TAKEN YEARS TO GET THE WORD OUT.  GREAT ME.  YOU REMEMBER.  I STARTED OFF WITH CHOPPING OFF  HEADS.  IT IS A LOUSY SUBJECT, TO BE  HONEST WITH YOU. I SAID, I AM 100% FINE WITH WATERBOARDING, AND IT SHOULD BE INCREASED.   BY THE WAY, JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND, THEY SAID, HE WANTS  TO DISOBEY THE LAW.  IT'S TRUE, WE HAVE LAWS. WE ARE TOO ROUGH WITH OUR ENEMY -- THEY JUST TOPPED OFF THREE  HEADS OF CHRISTIANS, WHO ARE  GREAT PEOPLE, WHO WENT OVER THERE TO HELP PEOPLE. THEY GRAB THEM, AND CHOP OFF  THEIR HEADS BECAUSE THEY ARE  GREAT PEOPLE HELPING PEOPLE. I'M SAYING TO MYSELF, I HAVE TO  DEFEND -- JUST SO YOU  UNDERSTAND, WE HAVE RULES AND REGULATIONS, RULES OF  ENGAGEMENT.  THEY HAVE NOTHING. VERY HARD TO BEAT SOMEONE WHEN  YOU HAVE RULES AND REGULATIONS  AT VERY HIGH LEVEL.  THIS IS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE. WE CATCH ONE OF THESE ANIMALS WHO HAS JUST TOPPED OFF 10 HEADS , AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE  WE CAN TRY THEM. FIRST OF ALL, THEY'RE GOING TO  GUANTANAMO BAY, SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND. THEY ARE GOING TO GUANTANAMO  BAY.  THAT WILL BE IT.  YOU SEE THE MONEY WE SPEND. WE ARE SPENDING HUNDREDS OF  MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR, AND  WE HAVE LIKE 90 PRISONERS LEFT,  OR 60 PRISONERS BUT.  BELIEVE ME, WE CAN DO BETTER  THAN THAT.  THERE IS SO MUCH FAT. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS MAINTAINING A PLACE FOR 90 PEOPLE -- WE CAN DO MUCH BETTER. TORTURE. WATERBOARDING IS FINE.  ALSO, IF WE CAN GO MUCH WERE SPENT WORS, THAT IS OK WITH ME TOO. THEY SAY, HE MAY NOT OBEY THE LAWS -- LOOK, TORTURE IS TERRIBLE, WE  ALL AGREE. BUT WHEN SOMEBODY IS DOING THESE HORRIBLE ACT, THE CUTTING AND  THE DROWNING, WE HAVE TO FIGHT  LIKE WE HAVE TO FIGHT. WHAT HAPPENS IS WE HAVE TO  EXPAND OUR LAWS, WE HAVE TO GET  MUCH TOUGHER. WE HAVE TO KNOCK THEM SO FAST  AND FURIOUS. ISIS EATS DINNER LIKE WE DO,  LIKE YOU HAVE DINNER AND WE HAVE DINNER. CAN YOU IMAGINE THEM SITTING  AROUND, AND EACH ONE OF THEM  CHOPPED OFF THREE HEADS TODAY  AND DROWNED 70 PEOPLE. AND THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE UNITED STATES DOESN'T ALLOW  WATERBOARDING, WHICH PEOPLE  DON'T CONSIDER TORTURE.  THINK ABOUT IT, CAN YOU IMAGINE  WHAT THESE PEOPLE SAY? CAN YOU  IMAGINE WHAT THESE PEOPLE SAY  ABOUT THE UNITED STATES? THERE IS A STORY I TELL, THIS IS  WHEN WE WERE STRONG. GENERAL PERSHING, HAS ANYONE HEARD THAT STORY? HAS ANYBODY NOT HEARD IT. SHOULD I TELL IT? HE'S A ROUGH GUY, SITTING ON A  HORSE. A BEAUTIFUL LOOKING GUY, UP ON THE HORSE. AND THEY WERE HAVING PROBLEMS  WITH RADICAL ISLAM ASKED --  RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE. WE HAVE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT, WE CANNOT ALLOW PEOPLE INTO  THE COUNTRIES THAT WANT TO  DESTROY US. WE CAN'T ALLOW THE MIGRATIONS  AND THE SYRIANS INTO THE  COUNTRY. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY COME  FROM. THEY WERE HAVING A TREMENDOUS  PROBLEM. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND NOW IS THE WEAPONRY. THE WEAPONS ARE SO POWERFUL, WHAT THEY CAN TAKE OUT IS THE  DESTRUCTION. THEY HAVE A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM. A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WE  HANDLE TODAY. WE SEE -- WE FEED THEM THE BEST  FOOD, GIVE THEM AREAS TO PRAY. WE ARE WONDERFUL WONDERFUL,  STUPID PEOPLE. HE HAD THE WHOLE DEAL GOING. THEY'RE DOING TREMENDOUS DESTRUCTION. HE LINES THEM UP TO BE SHOT. KNOWS THEY ARE GUILTY, ADMITTED  THEIR GUILT. AS YOU KNOW, SWINE, TAKE, A BIG  PROBLEM FOR THEM. HE TOOK THE BULLETS, THE 50  BULLETS, DROPPED THEM IN,  SWITCHED THEM AROUND, SO THERE  WAS BLOOD ALL OVER THOSE  BULLETS.  INSTRUCTED HIS MEN TO PUT THE  BULLETS INTO THE RIFLE. THEY PUT THE BULLETS INTO THE RIFLES AND A SHOT 49 MEN. LET'S NOT BE A COUNTRY ANYMORE. THEY SHOT 49 OF THE 50 MEN. IT WAS A PAGAN INFESTED BULLETS  IN EACH ONE. THEY THEN DUMPED THE BODIES INTO  A MASS GRAVE AND DUMPED THE PIGS  AND WITH THE BODIES. THEY TOOK THE FINAL BULLET AND  GIVE IT TO THE ONE PERSON THEY  DECIDED NOT TO SHOOT AND SAID,  TAKE THIS BULLET, GO BACK TO YOUR PEOPLE, AND EXPLAINED TO  THEM WHAT WE JUST DID. THAT'S NOT THE END.  WANT TO HEAR THE END? HE WENT BACK AND SAID WHAT JUST HAPPENED, 428 YEARS THERE WAS NO  TERRORISM.  28 YEARS. I'M NOT SAYING THAT IS A GOOD THING, THAT IS A BAD -- THIS IS  JUST HISTORY. WE ARE EITHER WITH -- WE ARE  EITHER GOING TO WIN OR GOING TO  LOSE. WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO GO THE WAY  WE ARE GOING RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE TO DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HORRIBLE THOUGHTS, PEOPLE WHO HAVE VISIONS YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.  WHEN I WON IN SOUTH CAROLINA,  JUST BEFORE THE VOTE, THE POLK  SAID -- THIS COULD ONLY HAPPEN  TO ME. HE'S ON A PLANE AND SAID SOMETHING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. WHAT HE SAYS IS WHAT THE MEXICANS TOLD HIM, LOOK, WE HAVE TO STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. THEY SAID IT IS TERRIBLE WHAT  THIS AMERICAN TRUMP WANTS TO DO.  THE NEXT DAY -- YOU CAN'T GET  THE POPE TO APOLOGIZE. I SAID ON THE ONLY PERSON, BECAUSE I FELT I COULD WIN IN  SOUTH CAROLINA, EVEN THOUGH IT  IS SUPPOSED TO BE CRUISE TERRITORY AND I WON IN A MASSIVE LANDSLIDE. I WON WITH MIDDLE -- I WON WITH WOMEN, WON WITH MEN. I WON WITH SOLDIERS, ONE THING  WITH EVANGELICALS.  I WON WITH EVERYBODY. EVEN A SCENE LIKE YESTERDAY, I  DID NOT WANT TO PUT THE POLICE  AT ANY DISCOMFORT LEVEL. WE HAVE 300 POLICE, THE SECRET  SERVICE GUYS WHO ARE RIGHT HERE.  THEY ARE FANTASTIC PEOPLE. I DON'T WANT TO PUT THEM TO A  STRONG TEST.  WE WERE GIVEN CREDIT FOR DOING  THE RIGHT THING. BY DOING WHAT I DID, THAT STORY  IS ALL OVER THE WORLD RIGHT NOW,  THAT WE MADE THE RIGHT DECISIONS  UNDER A GREAT DEAL OF PRESSURE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH EASIER.  LET PEOPLE FIGHT, LET PEOPLE  HURT THEMSELVES. THE PEOPLE THAT PROTESTED, ONE  OF THEM SAID I THINK WE GAVE  TRUMP A GOOD PLATFORM. THEY HAD BILL AYRES THERE. THEY HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE. THEY ARE NOT REALLY GOOD.  WE HAVE TO HAVE ONE PROTESTER. SO WE HAVE ONE PROTESTER. HE'S A WHACKED JOB. LISTEN -- WHAT IS THE STORY TOMORROW?  MASSIVE PROTEST AT TRUMP RALLY.  THEY WON'T TALK ABOUT THE  CROWDS. AGAIN, THEY ARE THE WORST. WE'RE GOING TO STRENGTHEN OUR  COUNTRY. JUST THE FACT HE APPROVES NAFTA, NOBODY KNOWS THAT. THE FACT HE WAS WITH LEHMAN BROTHERS, THERE ARE SO MANY FACTORS. CAN'T BE PRESIDENT.  IT WILL BE NOT A GOOD SITUATION. I WILL DO SUCH A GREAT JOB, YOU  HAVE NO IDEA. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SURPRISED.  I'M GOING TO BRING JOBS AND  COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE  JOBS. I'M GOING TO BRING JOBS BACK  FROM JAPAN. I'M GOING TO BRING JOBS BACK TO  THIS COUNTRY. AND YOU WON'T EVEN BELIEVE IT. WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN.  JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS.  WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT AND WE ARE  NOT GOING TO GIVE IT UP. TRADE DEALS, WE ARE GOING TO  MAKE SOME OF THE GREATEST DEALS EVER MADE. I'M THE MOST CONSERVATIVE PERSON  IN THE WORLD ON THE MILITARY, ON  THE VETS, AND -- ON EDUCATION. HE WASN'T A NICE PERSON.  HE WAS NOT A NICE GUY, JEB BUSH  WAS NOT A NICE GUY. LET ME JUST TELL YOU HE IS GOING -- WE ARE GOING TO BE STRONG ON  TRADE.","Donald Trump Campaign Rally in Vandalia, Ohio"

IT'S A GREAT HONOR. LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE WAS FUN. IT WAS DIFFERENT. IT GOT A WONDERFUL, DO A LOT OF GOOD FEELINGS IN THAT ROOM AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING FRANKLY THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NEEDED. ENTITY IS SOMETHING VERY, VERY SPECIAL BECAUSE DR. BEN CARSON WAS RESPECTED BY EVERYBODY. EVERYBODY WANTED HIS ENDORSEMENT AND EVERYBODY LOVES HIM AND TRULY, TRULY ADMIRES WHAT HE'S DONE. HIS LIFE HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE LIFE. IT'S BEEN AN AWE-INSPIRING LIFE. I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT HAVING HIS SUPPORT REALLY I THINK IT ADDS TOTAL CREDENCE TO WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO AND DO WHAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DO. SO I JUST WANT TO INTRODUCE DR. BEN CARSON, SPECIAL, SPECIAL PERSON, SPECIAL MAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  >> MR. TRUMP, TWO QUESTIONS. FIRST OF ALL DID YOU GUYS GENTLY OR FORMALLY APOLOGIZED TO EACH OTHER'S BECAUSE IT IS POLITICS. IT'S A TOUGH STUFF. IT'S A TOUGH BUSINESS. I USED USED TO THINK REAL ESTATE IN MANHATTAN WAS TOUGH. THIS IS A TOUGH BUSINESS AND IS POLITICS. A LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN IN POLITICS THAT DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE ELSE. SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT. GO AHEAD.  >> SECONDLY, THE QUESTION THAT COMES UP, HAS TO BE ANY DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU COME ANY PROMISES MADE ABOUT POSITION FOR DR. CARSON INTO ADMINISTRATION EITHER AS A RUNNING MATE OR --  >> NO. I THOUGHT WAS LOVE. WHEN HE CALLED HE JUST WANTS TO HELP. HE FEEL STRONG ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND YOU SEE THE GRATITUDE. WE GET CROWDS ARE AMAZING. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY BEING ANYTHING LIKE IT. IT'S ON THE COVER OF EVERY MAGAZINE THAT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. BEN SEES THAT AND BEN LOVE BIG, BIG PART I CAN TELL YOU. ME BECAUSE I DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THIS YET A BEN IS GOING TO HAVE A BIG PART. WE WANT TO KEEP THAT KIND OF TALENT. YES.  >> DO YOU SEE MR. CARSON, DR. CARSON PLAYING A POLICY ROLE PRINCIPALLY FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN OR AS A CIRCUIT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL GOING PLACES YOU ARE NOT GOING TO? EDWIN MEESE IS OUR TO DONALD TRUMP'S, DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT CHARACTERIZATION AND COULD YOU AMPLIFY ON?  >> I PROBABLY DO AGREE. THERE'S THE PUBLIC VERSION AND PEOPLE SEE THAT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY SEE EXACTLY WHAT IT SEEMS TO WORK OVER MY LIFETIME BUT IT'S PROBABLY DIFFERENT I THINK THAN THE ORIGINAL DONALD TRUMP. I THINK I'VE I WOULD SAY, HE SAID IT VERY WELL. PERHAPS THERE ARE TO DONALD TRUMP'S. I AM SOMEBODY THAT IS A THINK OF THE I'M A BIG THINKER AND I HAVE IDEAS AND THEY ARE STRONG AND TYPICALLY THEY HAVE WORKED OUT. WHAT I WANT TO DO IS, BEN OVER TO THE THING I HAVE FOR THIS ANTI-CAMPAIGN IS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. VERY SIMPLE. I WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH THE MILITARY, TRADE, BORDERS, WHETHER IT'S TERRORISM. WE HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS, THE DEBT. YOU LOOK AT OUR DEBT $19 TRILLION GOING UP TO $21 TRILLION IN A VERY SHORT SESSION. WE ARE GOING TO STRAIGHTEN THINGS OUT AND STRAIGHTEN THEM OUT CORRECTLY.   >> DR. CARSON IS BOTH. DR. CARSON IS BOTH BUT YOU'LL BE VERY MUCH ON POLICY. BEN WAS ALWAYS RESTORE THE POLICY AND HE WILL BE VERY MUCH ON POLICY.  >> YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT UNITY ON THE CONVENTIONAL AND THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT OR CAN YOU FILL US IN ON ANY OUTREACH EFFORT SHOULD MAKING TO CAPITOL HILL?  >> WE HAVE BEEN CALLED BY THE BIGGEST PEOPLE IN POLITICS, NOT ONLY REPUBLICAN POLITICS BUT ALSO THE BIGGEST PEOPLE IN REPUBLICAN POLITICS. OVER THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS. YOU SAW PAUL RYAN REACHED OUT, TERRIFIC GUY, THOSE RESPECTED HIM, I'VE ALWAYS LIKED THEM. NOT MESSAGE WITH A GRIN EVERYTHING BECAUSE I'M VERY STRONG ON BORDERS AND VERY STRONG ON SECURITY. AND I THINK PAUL, I THINK ALL IS,, I THINK IS GOING HAVE IS YOUR ON A THINK PROBABLY CERTAIN THINGS WILL CHANGE. BUT PAUL RYAN REACHED OUT AND WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION. MANY OF THE PEOPLE OF THE TOP TOP LEVEL, I GET A KICK, I SEE YOU COMING WHEN PRODUCING DONALD TRUMP MUST BE STOPPED. I TALK TO THEM TWO DAYS BEFORE AND USING DONALD, WE MUST COME TOGETHER. WE'VE BEEN CONTACTED BY MANY OF THE BIGGEST PEOPLE IN REPUBLICAN COMMENTS.   >> THEY ARE REACHING OUT TO US BECAUSE THEY SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED. WE ARE GETTING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ADDITIONAL PEOPLE, PEOPLE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS NEVER HAD BEFORE. IT'S THE BIGGEST STORY. THE BIGGEST STAR IN POLITICS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING. WE ARE HAVING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE COME UP AND VOTE FOR THE REPUBLICANS. THEY GET OUT, THEY REGISTER REPUBLICAN. I'VE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE TELL ME I'VE NEVER VOTED REPUBLICAN IN MY LIFE. I LEFT THE DEMOCRATS IN ORDER TO REGISTER AS REPUBLICAN SO I COULD VOTE FOR YOU. INDEPENDENTS, DEMOCRATS. WE ARE UP TO 65%, MORE THAN THAT. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE MORE. THAT'S WHAT I AM SAYING. THE REPUBLICANS THAT WANT TO EMBRACE IT. I SEE IT. THEY WANT TO EMBRACE IT.  >> LAST NIGHT AND THE DEBATE TO TALK ABOUT POTENTIALLY SENDING UP TO 30,000 AMERICAN TROOPS TO THE MIDDLE EAST TO FIGHT THE MIDDLE EAST. THAT'S MORE TROOPS THAN GEORGE BUSH SENT IN AFGHANISTAN.  >> WE HAVE TO GET RID OF ISIS. IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO THE GENERALS. THE GENERALS WILL HAVE TO PLAY THEIR OWN GAME. I WANT TO FIND OUT, I WANT TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE RIGHT GENERAL. WE DON'T WANT OTHER WRONG GENERAL TALKING TO US BUT WE WILL FIND THE RIGHT GENERAL. WE WILL FIND THE RIGHT GUY OR PERSONS OR WOMAN.  >> IT'S A FUNNY THING I WAS THINKING ABOUT YESTERDAY. IF YOU NOTICE, I MEAN THE CNN POLL CAME OUT 49-15. HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT? HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HAPPY. IF YOU NOTICE DURING THIS WHOLE THING, NATIONAL OF TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE, ALTHOUGH I GUESS IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THE CNN COMES OUT 49 FOR TRUMP AND 15 FOR THE TWO OTHERS I THINK WERE AT 15. THE ONE PERSON THAT JUST KEPT SNEAKING UP ON ME, I COULDN'T LOSE HIM, WAS DR. BEN CARSON. I COULD NOT LOSE THAT GUY. I WAS DOING WELL AND TRUMP WOULD BE A 28 AT THAT TIME. I REMEMBER 28 AND BEN WAS 18. THEN HE WAS IN 19 AT THE NEXT WEEK IT WAS LIKE 22. WHAT'S HAPPENING? I DON'T LIKE THIS, RIGHT? THEN HE WAS 24. THAT I HAD A PRETTY GOOD BALL WHERE I TOOK A LITTLE FEED IN ONE, BUT THEN WHAT HAPPENED IS IT WAS I BELIEVE IN B.C., ""WALL STREET JOURNAL"" THE ALWAYS GIVES ME BAD POLLS BY THE HAVE TO CHILE. THANK YOU FOR THE NICE THINGS I SAID ABOUT ME. YOU ARE SO NICE, THANK YOU. SITTING NEXT TO DAVID, OKAY? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALWAYS SO NICE. NOW SHE'S GOING TO BE EMBARRASSED BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU. BEN WOULD ALWAYS LIKE YOU WOULD BE THERE AND THEN WE HAD ONE BALL WHERE BEN WENT AHEAD. IT WAS THE BIGGEST STORY WORLDWIDE. I SAID THIS GUY IS UNBELIEVABLE. AND SO I STARTED GOING AFTER BEN. IT'S POLITICS. BEN UNDERSTANDS IT. I WAS WILL IMPRESS WITH THE WAY HE FOUGHT BACK BECAUSE HE FOUGHT BACK WITH SILENCE AND STRENGTH. AND EVEN COMMENT ON. SOMEONE WOULD'VE SAID, THEY WOULD HAVE DONE WELL. HE HAS GREAT CONFIDENCE IN HIMSELF AND I WAS EDITOR INTEREST AND IT IS TRUE, HE'S THE ONE PERSON. I USE THE EXPRESSION I COULD LOSING. I COULDN'T SHAKING. HE DID SO WELL AND JUST GO UP, UP, UP SO STEADY, SO SOLID. AND I FOUGHT BACK AND I HIT HIM HARD AND HE, WHICH IS POLITICS AND BEN UNDERSTANDS THAT AND HE UNDERSTOOD THAT BECAUSE I TALKED TO HIM ABOUT IT YESTERDAY BUT HE HANDLED IT WITH SUCH DIGNITY. I FRANKLY THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING. I ACTUALLY GAINED A LOT OF RESPECT FOR HIM.  >> IT'S POLITICS AND ITS FACT. WE'VE HAD SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE, PROTESTERS. THEY ARE NOT JUST PEOPLE SAYING, THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT PUNCH. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE VIOLENT PEOPLE. I GET THE BIGGEST CROWDS BY FOUR. NOT EVEN A CONTEST. YOU PEOPLE DON'T LIKE REPORTED BUT THE ONE THING GOOD ABOUT PROTESTERS THEY JUST AGO INTO THESE STADIUMS WITH 25, 30,000 PEOPLE AND JUDGES, THE CAMERAS NEVER TURN. THE CAMERAS NEVER EVER TURN. I ALWAYS SAY TURN AND SHOW THAT THEY DON'T WHEN THERE'S A PROTESTER IN THE CORNER IT'S GREAT BECAUSE THE CAMERA IS THERE. IT'S A NEGATIVE AS A POSTAL POSITIVE SO THEY TURN. WE'VE HAD A COUPLE THAT WERE REALLY VIOLENT AND THE PARTICULAR ONE WHEN I SAID I WOULD BRING THEM, THAT WAS A VERY COME YOU TO COME A GUY WHO WAS SWINGING, VERY LOUD AND THEN STARTED SWINGING AT THE AUDIENCE. THE AUDIENCE SWUNG BACK. I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY, VERY APPROPRIATE. HE WAS SWINGING. HE WAS HITTING PEOPLE. THE AUDIENCE HIT BACK AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED, ALTHOUGH THAT WERE A. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST A PROTESTER. THIS WAS A GUY WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO DO WHAT HE DID. AND, FRANKLY, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH THE POLICE WERE VERY, VERY RESTRAINED. THE POLICE HAVE BEEN AMAZING BUT THE POLICE WERE VERY, VERY RESTRAINED. OKAY, YES.  >> I JUST THINK IT WAS DONE. IT WAS VERY SUBSTANTIVE LAST BUT. I HAVE SAID BEFORE IT WAS A VERY ELOQUENT DEBATE. BEN CAME IN AND SAID THAT WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL DEBATE LAST NIGHT. IT'S GOTTEN GREAT REVIEWS AS A DEBATE. I WILL TELL PEOPLE THAT WANT EVEN THOUGH I DID ONE, LET ME JUST SAY. I REFUSE TO SAY THAT ""TIME"" MAGAZINE, 80. SLATE 84. FOX 91% AT FOX. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. NEW JERSEY.COM. ANYWAY, WE HAD A DEBATE LAST AND I THINK I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO ACTUALLY, BUT IT WAS, I DON'T KNOW. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH DEBATES IN MY OPINION. WE'VE HAD DEBATES, THEY'VE BEEN LIVE EVENTS McMAHON SHOULD'VE PUT THEM ON BECAUSE THEY WERE WWE. AND TOO MUCH. I THINK LAST NIGHT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT IT COME OFF LIKE THAT WE DIDN'T SPEAK AND THE CANDIDATES DIDN'T SPEAK ABOUT IT BUT IT JUST SORT OF MORPHED INTO A VERY DIGNIFIED DEBATE.  >> I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE I WOULDN'T TAKE ANY MONEY. IF ANYTHING THE PARTY WOULD TAKING MONEY. I DON'T WANT MONEY BUT THE CALM IT'S UP TO THEM, NOT UP TO ME. IT'S SOMETHING I'VE NOT GIVEN MUCH THOUGHT TO GET I'VE SO FUNDED MY CAMPAIGN. I GUESS I WILL BE IN FOR 50, $60 MILLION AT A MINIMUM. I AM SOMEBODY WHO IS A BUSINESSPERSON AND EVEN WHEN I DON'T, THE MONEY SORT OF IRRELEVANT BUT I'VE A NATURAL INSTINCT TO BE A LITTLE BIT CAREFUL WITH MONEY BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY I CAN. THAT'S THE WAY WE HAVE TO BE WITH OUR COUNTRY. I EXPECT TO HAVE TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY IN THIS BY THE TIME WE FINISHED IT I GUESS RIGHT NOW I AM INTO, YOU WOULD KNOW BETTER, MAYBE $30 MILLION, MAYBE MORE BUT OTHER PEOPLE ARE IN FOR $150 MILLION THEY ARE NOWHERE. THEY ARE OUT OF THE RACE. I'M PROUD OF THE RACE WE HAVE ONE. SOMEBODIES HAVE EASILY BEEN DOING THIS FOR EIGHT MONTHS BUT I KNOW THIS IS A BETTER THAN ANYBODY. THE REASON I KNOW BECAUSE I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SYSTEM SO WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT CAMPAIGN FINANCE COME ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS, I KNOW IT MUCH BETTER AND I KNOW IT FROM THE REAL SIDE. NOT FROM THE POLITICIANS SIDE.  >> I DON'T THINK SO. I ANSWERED TRUTHFULLY. WE ARE ADEQUATE WE HAVE TO START BEING TRUTHFUL WITH OUR COUNTRY. LIKE THE QUESTION ON ISLAM THAT I'M ANSWERING THE QUESTION AND I KNOW THE EXACT ANSWER. I COULD'VE GIVEN AN END TO THE OTHER NIGHT TO ANDERSON COOPER WHICH WOULD'VE BEEN PERFECT AND NO ONE WOULD'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT. IT WOULD'VE BEEN FINE BUT IT IS AISA PROBLEM AND WITHOUT A FIGHT WITH THE PROBLEM IS. WE'VE GOT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND YOU WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN RUSSIA KNOW THAT IS A PROBLEM. I WANT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS HONESTLY AND FORTHRIGHTLY AND EVEN IF I BOUGHT A BIG STAGE WITH ALL OF THESE TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF CAMERAS TO READ I HAVE TO ANSWER HONESTLY. THE ONLY WAY WE'LL SOLVE THE DIFFICULTIES OVER COUNTRY. YES GO AHEAD.  >> JUST ALONG THE SAME LINES. WHY ARE THERE TO DONALD TRUMP'S PRESTIGIOUS SOME POINT MAKE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY IN PUBLIC?  >> I'M GOING TO WORK WITH BEN ON SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. I WILL BE HONEST WHEN I WAS WITH BEN YESTERDAY THE THING THAT MOST IMPRESSED ME, I'M ALL ABOUT HIS USE OF HEALTH CARE BECAUSE I FORGET AND I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT HE KNEW MORE ABOUT THAN THE OTHER PEOPLE ON THE STAGE AND PERHAPS HE SHOULD BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT HE WAS DOING BUT I WAS MOST IMPRESSED WITH HIS VIEWS ON EDUCATION. IT'S A STRENGTH AND IT'S A TREMENDOUS STRENGTH. SO BEN WILL BE INVOLVED WITH US IN ANY ASPECT YOU WANTS TO BE BUT IN PARTICULAR ON THOSE TWO SUBJECTS. OKAY.  >> THEY DEPEND. YOU CAN SAY. I DIDN'T GO THERE AS A TONED DOWN PERSON. I WENT AND WHATEVER HAPPENS HAPPENS. YOU HAVE TO SWING WITH THE PUNCHES. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I WENT THERE, I DID NOT A VICE GOING TO BE, IF I WAS HIT I WOULD HAVE HIT BACK. THE ARE THOSE PEOPLE ARE SAID TO ME, I WAS TELLING BEN YESTERDAY THE ARE THOSE PEOPLE IT DOESN'T MATTER, LET THEM CALL YOU NAMES, BUT CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. STAND THERE AND TAKE IT. YOU ARE LEADING THE UNITED STATES AND TO LEAD. NOBODY IS GOING TO BEAT YOU. DON'T DO ANYTHING. AND I SAY I CAN'T DO THAT. WHEN SOMEBODY HITS, I HAVE TO GET BACK. SO I THOUGHT THEY WERE VERY RESPECTFUL YESTERDAY. I THOUGHT FRANKLY EVERYBODY DID WELL. I THOUGHT IT WAS AM HOW MY USE OF THE EXPRESSION OF THAT IS VERY ELOQUENT DEBATE LAST NIGHT.  >> I WE'VE HAD ENOUGH DEBATES. HOW MANY TIMES DID HE GIVE THE SAME ANSWER TO THE SAME QUESTION? DO YOU AGREE WITHOUT? SAME QUESTION, SAME PEOPLE, SAME EVERYTHING. IT WOULD BE NICE TO FINISH OFF WITH THIS ONE. I THOUGHT CNN DID A FANTASTIC JOB LAST THE. I THOUGHT THAT JAKE WAS A GREAT MODERATOR. IT WAS JUST, IT WAS JUST A REALLY NICE WAY TO FINISH OFF THE DEBATE SEASON THAT I REALLY THINK IT'S ENOUGH DEBATES. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REASON FOR THE DEBATES. I NOTED GETTING VERY BIG RATINGS. AND BY THE WAY, THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOT GETTING RATINGS AT ALL AND OUR DEBATES ARE GETTING VERY, VERY BIG RATINGS. ONE OF THOSE THINGS. I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH. LOOK, THAT NETWORKS WITHIN. I DON'T THINK ANY OF THE CANDIDATES WANTED AT THIS POINT THE NETWORKS VERY MUCH WANT THEM.  >> I WAS SAYING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SHOULD COME TOGETHER AND EMBRACE THESE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING DOWN AND VOTING. MILLIONS. SOUTH CAROLINA, NEW HAMPSHIRE. NO MATTER WHERE IT IS, MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. I WAS GOING TO BRING DOWN A LIST AND I SAID I DIDN'T WANT TO BORE YOU PEOPLE BUT WE'VE HAD SOME STATES UP 102% FROM FOUR YEARS AGO. 102%. THERE'S SOMETHING HAPPENING THAT'S BEAUTIFUL TO SEE. THESE ARE PEOPLE IN MANY CASES AS I SAID LAST NIGHT THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE NEVER VOTED. BEN, HAD PEOPLE COME UP, 40, 50, 60, 70 YEARS OLD, SO MANY PEOPLE. THEY SAY I'VE NEVER VOTED BEFORE. THEY NEVER PUT A POLITICAL SHIRT ON AND ALLIES. THEY WERE NOT POLITICAL PEOPLE. THEY NEVER HAD CONFIDENCE IN THE PEOPLE THAT THEY WERE VOTING FOR. LITERALLY WHEN I SHAKE HANDS WITH PEOPLE OR WHEN I SIGN AUTOGRAPHS, PEOPLE ARE SAYING I'VE NEVER VOTED BEFORE, MR. TRUMP, BUT I AM SO PROUD TO BE VOTING. SOME PEOPLE COAL EARLY VOTING. IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING THING. WHAT I SAID TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF IF THERE IS SUCH A THING. I GUESS I USED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE IS. BUT I SAID EMBRACE IT INSTEAD OF FIGHTING IT, INSTEAD OF FIGHTING ME LIKE THESE PEOPLE FROM, PEOPLE WHO CAME TO OFFICE, ASKED ME FOR $1 MILLION. I SAID OR THEY? I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THEY ARE. THEY ASKED ME FOR $1 MILLION I SAID LET ME THINK ABOUT IT. THEN I FOUND WHO THEY ARE AND I SAID I'M NOT GOING TO WASTE $1 MILLION. ACID AS I THEY SAID THAT THEY STARTED DOING NEGATIVE ADS. IF I WOULD GIVE THEM $1 MILLION, THEY WOULD NOT DO NEGATIVE ADS. THEY ARE EXTORTIONIST. I SEE NEGATIVE ADS WHICH ARE ALL WRONG. SO THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE. WE SHOULD EMBRACE IT. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SHOULD GRAB THIS AND WE WILL HAVE THE VICTORY RIGHT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS NEVER HAD BEFORE. ONE OF THE THINGS BEN AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT I WILL WIN MICHIGAN. THAT'S A IN THE PLAYBOOK FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN NEW YORK. THAT'S THE AND THE PLAYBOOK. THEY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT A SIX-DAY CHECK TO WIN, FLORIDA, VIRGINIA, JUST GO DOWN THE LINE, PENNSYLVANIA, OHIO. YOU HAVE TO WHEN CERTAIN STATES. IF YOU LOSE ONE OF THEM IT'S OVER FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THE FACT IS STRUCTURALLY IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR SOMEBODY TO GET ELECTED FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. WITH ME, I AT ALL OF THE RUST BELT STATE. I OWN STATES THAT I WILL GET STATES THAT ARE UNBELIEVABLE, THAT ARE UNTHINKABLE FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND WE SHOULD EMBRACE IT. A COUPLE MORE.  >> HILLARY IS TERRIBLE. FIRST OF ALL SHE HAS NO BUSINESS. SHE DOES HAVE THE ENERGY OR STRENGTH TO GET THE RIGHT TRADE DEALS ME. YOU NEED STRENGTH, YOU NEED STAMINA, YOU NEED A LOT TO GET THESE DEALS DONE. THEY COME AT YOU IN WAVES. TO DO THESE DEALS WITH A WRAP THEM UP AND PUT 12 DEALS IN ONE, TPP IS INEXORABLE, I WANT INDIVIDUAL TRADE DEALS WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES. SOME DEALS WE WILL MAKE SO GOOD, SOME COUNTRIES TREAT US BETTER THAN OTHERS. SOME ARE WORSE. CHINA WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TPP. IT'S NOT IN IT NOW BUT BELIEVE ME THEY WILL COME THROUGH THE BACKDOOR. THEY ARE WATCHING IT SO CLOSELY. I HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS IN CHINA. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR JOHN. I'M NOT ANGRY AT CHINA. I'M ANGRY AT OUR PEOPLE. WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA THIS YEAR $500 BILLION. IT'S UNSUSTAINABLE. WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE OR TRADE DEALS, WE WILL MAKE GREAT DEALS. WE ARE GOING TO BECOME A RICH NATION AGAIN. WE CANNOT BECOME A GREAT NATION AND TO WE BECOME RICH AGAIN. I'M GOING TO SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY. THERE IS SO MANY THINGS WE CAN DO. IT'S GOING TO GO QUICKLY. YES.  >> AND WE ASK QUESTIONS TO DR.

WHY NOT SENATOR CRUZ?","Donald Trump News Conference in West Palm Beach, Florida"

DONALD TRUMP: WELL, THANK YOU  VERY MUCH EVERYONE. THIS WAS AN AMAZING EVENING. I DON'T THINK I HAVE HAD SO MANY HORRIBLE THINGS SAID ABOUT ME IN ONE WEEK. $38 MILLION. HORRIBLE LIVES. IT SHOWS YOU HOW RIDICULOUS IT IS.  THEY WERE LIES.  IT WAS REALLY AMAZING TO WATCH.  AND TO GET THESE KIND OF  NUMBERS, OR THEY CALL THEM IMMEDIATELY, IT IS JUST SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL. I WANT TO THANK THE PUBLIC.  AND I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE  OF MICHIGAN.  I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF MISSISSIPPI.  THIS IS SUCH A GREAT HONOR.  IT IS ALSO REALLY WONDERFUL TO  HAVE YOU AT TRUMP NATIONAL GOLF  CLUB.  IT IS A JACK NICHOLAS SIGNATURE  CLUB.  IT IS A GREAT PLACE. WE HAVE A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS  HERE, I SEE.  WE LOVE OUR MEMBERS. JACK NICHOLAS IS A SPECIAL MAN,  AND HE DID A SPECIAL JOB.  WE HAVE ANOTHER SPECIAL MEMBER.  PAUL O'NEILL, OF THE YANKEES. PAUL, STAND UP. YOU ORIGINALLY COME FROM OHIO, RIGHT? WOW.  PAUL O'NEILL.  YOU COME FROM OHIO? YOU ENDORSE ME?  I LOVE YOU.  THANK YOU, PAUL. THANK YOU.  WOW. THAT IS A GREAT ENDORSEMENT FROM OHIO.  THANK YOU. OH, HE IS GREAT. IT LOOKS LIKE HE COULD GO OUT  THERE RIGHT NOW. SO, I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU  THAT IT WAS AN INTERESTING WEEK  AND AMAZING WEEK.  I WANT TO CONGRATULATE A LOT OF  PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE CANDIDATES.  I MEAN, THIS IS NOT EASY ST  UFF. WHEN YOU ARE DOING THIS, IT IS  PRETTY WILD.  I MUST TELL YOU IT IS VERY  IMPORTANT AS A REPUBLICAN THAT  OUR SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN GET  REELECTED AND WE PUT A GOOD  GROUP OF PEOPLE TOGETHER, THAT  WE KEEP THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE.  WE HAVE SOME TERRIFIC PEOPLE. NOT ALL OF THEM ARE ON MY SIDE,  BUT WE HAVE SOME TERRIFIC PEOPLE.  IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. ONE OF THE THINGS I'M MOST HAPPY ABOUT IS THE TURNOUT HAS BEEN  JUST MASSIVE FOR EVERY WEEK.  WHETHER IT IS SOUTH CAROLINA OR  ANY PLACE, IT STARTED WITH NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IT REALLY -- IOWA. NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO, IT IS RECORDS. THE SINGLE BIGGEST STORY IN  POLITICS TODAY.  WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE BOOTH.  A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PEOPLE  ARE COMING OUT TO VOTE.  SOME STATES ARE GETTING -- ONE  HAS 102% INCREASE OVER FOUR  YEARS AGO. IT IS AMAZING. 102%.  ON AVERAGE, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT PROBABLY MORE THAN 50. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, WHEREAS THE DEMOCRATS ARE DOWN 30-35% FROM WHAT THEY WERE. THEY ARE DOWN. WE ARE UP BY 50%, AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT.  YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS OF  PEOPLE. I ACTUALLY THINK IT IS THE  BIGGEST STORY IN POLITICS TODAY. I HOPE THE REPUBLICANS WILL  EMBRACE IT.  WE HAVE DEMOCRATS COMING OVER. VERY IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE  INDEPENDENTS COMING OVER.  THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT PROBABLY  EVER.  WITH ALL OF THESE PEOPLE COMING  OVER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE  SOMETHING SPECIAL.  IF I WIN, AND I GET TO GO  AGAINST HILLARY, POLLS ARE  SHOWING THAT I BEAT HER.  AND SOME OF THE POLLS HAVE ME BEATING HER VERY EASILY. WHEN YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE, WE WILL TAKE MANY PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE  DEMOCRATS AND MANY PEOPLE AWAY  THAT NORMALLY GO DEMOCRAT AS INDEPENDENTS.  WE ARE SEEING THAT.  WE ARE SEEING THAT. WE HAD PEOPLE COME OVER HERE WHO  HAVE NEVER VOTED REPUBLICAN OR  THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND THEY CAME  AND VOTED REPUBLICAN.  AND I WILL TELL YOU ANOTHER  GROUP OF PEOPLE I HAVE SEEN.  I WILL BE SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS AND  TALKING TO PEOPLE.  I'VE HAD MANY PEOPLE SAY -- IT  WAS A BEAUTIFUL THING TO HEAR,  MR. TRUMP, I'M 67 YEARS OLD.  MANY PEOPLE. I'M 67 YEARS OLD.  I HAVE NEVER EVER VOTED BEFORE. I'VE NEVER COME CLOSE TO VOTING BEFORE.  THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I WILL  EVER VOTE.  THAT IS SO AMAZING.  SO AMAZING. AND THEY DO IT WITH SUCH SPIRIT. SO, IT'S GREAT. I WANT TO THANK THE SPECIAL INTERESTS AND LOBBYISTS.   BECAUSE THEY OBVIOUSLY DID  SOMETHING TO DRIVE THESE NUMBERS.  WE ARE CLOSE TO 50, 40.  NO, BUT I WANT TO CONGRATULATE  THEM BECAUSE TO RAISE THAT MUCH  MONEY THAT QUICKLY IS A PRETTY GOOD FEAT. MANY OF THEM ARE MY FRIENDS, BUT  THEY HAVE TO GAMBLE. I WANT TO THANK PAUL RYAN.  HE CALLED ME A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.  HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN NICER.  HE WAS VERY ENCOURAGING.  I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR PAUL  RYAN. GREAT RESPECT.  TED CRUZ IS INTERESTING.  HE IS ALWAYS SAYING I AM THE  ONLY ONE THAT CAN BEAT DONALD TRUMP.  YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE MISERABLE. YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR ME. BUT HE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN  BEAT DONALD TRUMP. I'VE HEARD IT SO MANY TIMES, BUT HE NEVER BEATS ME.  I MEAN, TAKE A LOOK.  MEANING, HE RARELY BEATS ME.  THE FACT IS WE ARE GOING TO DO  WELL.  TED CRUZ IS GOING TO HAVE A HARD  TIME WITH CERTAIN STATES.  ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO IS WE  GET UP NEW YORK.  I'M GOING TO DO GREAT. WE GET TO NEW JERSEY, I'M GOING  TO BE GREAT. CHRIS CHRISTIE IS HERE  SOMEPLACE, THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY, A GREAT PROSECUTOR. I WATCHED WHAT CHRIS CHRISTIE  DID TO MARCO.  WHERE IS HE? GREAT PROSECUTOR.  WHEN HE CAME AND CALLED HE SAID  I HAVE SEEN IT, IT IS AMAZING THING.  MANY PEOPLE HAVE CALLED IT A MOVEMENT. FOUR COVERS ON ""TIME MAGAZINE."" PART OF THE MOVEMENT IS WHAT I  SAID BEFORE.  THE PEOPLE WANT TO BE INVOLVED.  WHEN CHRIS CALLED AND SARAH  PALIN CALLED, AND JERRY FALWELL , JR. CALLED, WHEN JOE ARPAIO CALLED, WHEN HE CALLS DONALD TRUMP IS TOUGH ON THE BORDER. OK? I DON'T WANT TO BE TOUGH BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE FAIR. WE ARE GOING HAVE BORDERS AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A WALL. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY. THEY'RE GOING TO BE VERY HAPP  Y. THEY HAVE TO COME AND LEGALLY.  MITT ROMNEY GOT UP AND MADE A  SPEECH THE OTHER DAY. NO, IT'S OK.  NO, I UNDERSTAND.  HE'S A VERY NICE MAN.  BUT I UNDERSTAND.  IT'S HARD. WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THIS AND GET TO THE FINAL GATE AND YOU DON'T  GET OVER IT, IT IS A HARD THING.  HE DID MAKE SOME STATEMENTS.  I BROUGHT SOME THINGS UP BECAUSE  HE SAID WATER COMPANY IS GONE.  IT IS?  I HAVE SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES.  LET ME JUST EXPLAIN.  I WILL DO THIS IN TWO SECONDS. LET ME EXPLAIN. I FILED WITH THE FEDERAL  ELECTIONS 100 PAGES.  MANY OF THE PRESS HAVE ALREADY SEEN. THEY WERE ALL VERY IMPRESSED.  I BUILT A GREAT COMPANY. I HAVE LOW DEBT.  I HAVE ASSETS LIKE THIS.  THIS IS OWNED 100% BY ME WITH NO DEBTS.  YOU HAVE SEEN MAR LARGO. THAT IS A 100% BY ME, WITH NO DEBT.  I HAVE TRUMP INTERNATIONAL, WHERE YOU WERE LAST WEEK.  100% BY ME NO DEBT.  LOOK AT DORAL. PARTNERS WITH RELATED JOBS ON  THE BEACH, GILL AND MICHAEL ON THE BEACH.  MASSIVE BUILDINGS. NO ONE EVER TALKS ABOUT THIS STUFF. MANY, MANY JOBS IN NEW YORK,  INCLUDING THE CITY ON THE WEST SIDE -- ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PROJECTS EVER BUILT  IN REAL ESTATE.  THE BANK OF AMERICA BUILDING, A  BIG CHUNK OF IN SAN FRANCISCO. 1290. MANY THINGS. MITT GOT UP AND TALKED ABOUT THE WATER COMPANY. WE HAVE WATER, AND IT IS VERY SUCCESSFUL, AND I SUPPLY THE WATER FOR ALL OF MY STATES.  IT IS VERY GOOD.  WE HAVE TRUMP STEAKS. HE SAID, THE STEAK COMPANY. WE HAVE TRUMP STEAKS.  IF YOU WANT TO TAKE ONE, WE WILL CHARGE YOU $50 A STEAK.  WE HAVE ""TRIMPUMP MAGAZINE."" LET ME SEE THE MAGAZINE. HE SAID, IT IS OUT. I READ 12 DAYS AGO.  THIS IS CALLED THE JEWEL OF PALM BEACH.  THEY GOES TO ALL OF MY CLUBS.  ANYBODY WANT ONE? TAKE ONE, MY CLUB CHAMPION. THE AIRLINE, BY THE WAY, I SOLD TEGHEHE AIRLINE. THAT IS GREAT.  I ACTUALLY MADE A GREAT DEAL.  COMPLICATED AND IN TERRIBLE  TIMES.  THE ECONOMY WAS HORRIBLE.  I MADE A PHENOMENAL DEAL.  SO I'M HEARING ABOUT ALL OF  THESE THINGS.  BY THE WAY, TRUMP UNIVERSITY, WE  ARE HOLDING IT.  WHEN I WIN THE LAWSUIT, THEY DID  AND AD THE OTHER DAY, TWO OR  THREE PEOPLE WERE STAYING, IT IS  SO TERRIBLE.  THE REASON I DIDN'T SETTLE, ALL  OF THESE PEOPLE, WE SENT THEIR  LETTERS OUT. THE REPORTERS DO NOT LIKE TO  REPORT IT. THE REPORT CARDS WERE ALL EXCELLENT. BEAUTIFUL STATEMENTS.  WE LOVE IT.  YOU CAN'T SETTLE CASES WHEN THE  PERSON SUING YOU HAS GIVEN YOU  LETTERS AND TAPE SAYING HOW  GREAT IT IS.  IT WAS A NICE THING.  WE ARE PUTTING IT ON HOLD. IF I BECOME PRESIDENT, THAT MEANS IVANKA, DON, MY FAMILY  WELL STARTED UP. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT  PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET BACK INTO TRUMP UNIVERSITY. IT'S GOING TO DO WELL AND  CONTINUE TO DO WELL BUT WE HAVE  A LAWSUIT WHERE THEY ARE TRYING  TO GET ONE OF THESE CLASS-ACTION LAWYER GUYS AND IT IS RIDICULOUS.  WE WILL WIN THAT LAWSUIT. I JUST WANT TO EXPLAIN. I DO NOT SETTLE LAWSUITS. IT IS VERY RARE. ONCE YOU SETTLE LAWSUITS, IT IS SIMPLE. IT IS EASIER TO SETTLE. SOMETIMES IT IS CHEAPER TO  SETTLE BUT ONCE YOU SETTLE, I  HAD A FRIEND WHO WAS SUED VERY  RARELY AND EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE  SAME BUSINESS WAS SUED ALL THE  TIME.  HE SAID I NEVER SETTLE.  THE LAWYERS LEARN THEY DON'T SEE YOU.  WHEN I WATCH THESE BANKS  SETTLING LAWSUITS ALL THE TIME,  THEY GET PAID $40 MILLION A  YEAR.  A BANKER, AND THEN HE SETTLES  LAWSUITS WITH GOVERNMENTS AND  OTHER PEOPLE GETTING BILLIONS  AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, I DON'T  DO IT.  WHEN I SOLVE THE DIFFERENT  THINGS, AND THE WINERY, DOES HE  MENTION TRUMP VODKA?  IT'S THE LARGEST WINERY IN THE  EAST COAST.  I OWN IT 100%. NO MORTGAGE, NO DEBT. YOU HAVE TO CHECK THE RECORDS,  FOLKS. THE PRESS, YOU HAVE TO CHECK THE  RECORDS. YOU CAN SEE IF THERE IS ANY DEBT.  IT WAS JOHN CLUGE'S. HE DIED.  HE BUILT ONE OF THE GREAT  VINEYARDS OF ALL TIME.  THERE IS NOTHING LIKE IT.  CLOSE TO 2000 ACRES IN  CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA NEXT  TO THE THOMAS JEFFERSON  MEMORIAL. WE ARE PROUD OF IT.  THEY MAKE AS GOOD WINE AS YOU  CAN GET IN THE WORLD. I KNOW THE PRESS IS EXTREMELY  HONEST. I WILL NOT OFFER THEM ANY.  BUT IF THEY WANT, THEY CAN TAKE  A BOTTLE HOME.  THE MEMBERS HAVE PLENTY.  WE HAVE ONE OF THE GREATEST. WE HAVE THE LARGEST WINERY ON THE EAST COAST.  AND SO, I JUST WANTED TO PUT  THAT TO REST.  YOU HAVE THE WATER, THE STEAKS. YOU HAVE THE MAGAZINE, YOU HAVE  THE AIRLINE. WE ARE GOING TO START IT UP. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? OK.  I WANT TO THANK PAUL O'NEILL. THAT IS A BIG DEAL. I HAD SUCH RESPECT WHEN HE WAS A YANKEE.  HE WAS TOUGH. HE JUST DIDN'T MAKE MISTAKES.  WE COULD USE HIM RIGHT NOW.  I LOVE THAT KIND OF A GUY.  I THINK WHAT THIS SHOWS IS  ADVERTISING IS NOT AS IMPORTANT.  IT REALLY IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS  COMPETENCE. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN MORE MONEY SPENT ON HITTING SOMEBODY THAN WAS SPENT ON ME.  BETWEEN THAT AND PEOPLE SAYING THINGS.  AND YOU KNOW, LINDSEY GRAHAM  GOES HE IS A NASTY PERSON. FIRST OF ALL, HE IS WRONG ON THE  MILITARY.  I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 15 YEARS.  HE IS RIGHT. WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING A WAR FOR 15 YEARS WITH THIS TYPE OF THINKING.  IF YOU'RE GOING TO FIGHT A WAR  WIN THE WAR AND LET'S GET BACK  TO BUILDING OUR COUNTRY.  HE HAS BEEN SO NASTY.  I WATCH HIM AND SAY DOES HE HATE  DONALD TRUMP?  I WATCH HIM AND SAY IF YOU THINK  ABOUT IT EVERY SINGLE PERSON  THAT HAS ATTACKED ME HAS GONE  DOWN.  I DON'T WANT TO MENTION NAMES.  THEY ARE OUT. THEY ARE GONE. YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE PERSON.  WE STARTED WITH 17.  WE ARE DOWN TO 4.  OF THE FOUR THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH  ALL GONE.  OK? PRETTY MUCH. THEY DIDN'T DO SO WELL TONIGHT. I'M NOT GOING TO SAY ANYBODY DIDN'T DO WELL.  THEY DIDN'T DO WELL. THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON DID  WELL TO NIGHT, DONALD TRUMP.  I WILL TELL YOU.  I MEAN, IT WAS ACTUALLY AMAZING.  I WAS IMPRESSED. EVEN MEGYN KELLY SAID DONALD TRUMP DID WELL TONIGHT. THANK YOU.  THANK YOU.  THAT WAS A VERY UNUSUAL -- I WAS  SHOCKED TO HEAR THAT.  BUT THAT WAS VERY NICE. AND CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER SAID  THAT. THANK YOU, CHARLES. IT HAS BEEN A VERY LONG TIME. HE WAS VERY NICE.  THANK YOU.  I HAVE BEEN WAITING FIVE YEARS, CHARLES.  BUT, IT IS TRUE.  EVERY SINGLE -- I HAVE HAD SUCH  HOSTILITY LIKE WITH LINDSEY GRAHAM. HE WAS AT 7, HE ATTACKED ME. WE TOOK THEM DOWN TO ZERO.  HE LEAVES IN DISGRACE. HE GOES TO HIS OWN STATE.  THEY DO A POLL IN SOUTH  CAROLINA. HE ENDORSES SOMEBODY ELSE AND  THE POLL HAS ME AT 47, HIM AT 2 , AND HE IS A SITTING SENATOR.  AND THEN HE WENT DOWN FROM  THERE. YOU KNOW, I DON'T LIKE TO BRING  IT UP BUT I TELL YOU IT IS IN  NOW. JUST RELAX, GO HOME.  EVERYONE KNOWS YOU TAKE THIS BIG  DEFEAT AND THE PROBLEM IS THE  PRESS NEVER CALLS THEM OUT.  THEY GO TO THIS HORRIBLE DEFEAT  AND THEN THEY START IMMEDIATELY  ON THE ATTACK.  IT IS LIKE HE NEVER RAN AND MADE  A FOOL OF HIMSELF.  I CALL PEOPLE OUT.  IT IS TRUE, THEY HAVE ATTACKED  ME VICIOUSLY.  EVERY SINGLE ONE WHO HAS  ATTACKED ME IS GONE.  I AM VERY PROUD OF THAT.  THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE FOR  OUR COUNTRY. ISIS SHOULD NOT BE BEATING US.  WE DON'T WIN ANY MORE, WE DON'T  WIN WITH OUR MILITARY.  WE DON'T WIN WITH ANYTHING.  WE SHOULD BE IN A POSITION WHERE ISIS IS DICTATING TERMS.  THEY ASKED TED CRUZ -- LYIN' TED.  HE HOLDS THE BIBLE HIGH, AND HE  PUTS IT DOWN, AND HE LIES. LYIN' TED.  HE WILL SAY, I'M THE ONLY ONE  THAT BE DONALD TRUMP.  I BEAT HIM.  BUT HE DOESN'T SAY THE ONE 4 AND  I'VE ONE 12-13.  HE FORGETS THE OTHER PART.  YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, THE EVANGELICALS -- IN FACT, I WAS WATCHING CARL SAY HOW GREAT I  DID WITH THE EVANGELICALS. EVERYONE WAS SURPRISED. I'M A GOOD CHRISTIAN. THEY ARE CHIPPING AWAY AT CHRISTIANITY.  WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THAT  HAPPEN ANYMORE, FOLKS.  I TELL YOU.  A LOT OF TIMES I WILL SAY IT AT THE RALLIES, WE ARE GOING TO SAY  MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN. THE DEPARTMENT STORES DID NOT  PUT IT UP. WE ARE GOING TO START SAYING IT AGAIN.  THEY ARE CHIPPING AWAY AT  CHRISTIANITY AND WE CAN'T DO IT.  WITH THE EVANGELICALS, THEY GET  IT.  THEY GET ME.  THEY UNDERSTAND ME. I WILL BE THE BEST THING THAT  EVER HAPPENED TO THEM.  I MEAN THAT 100%. THEY DON'T LIKE THE WAY TED  TALKS AND THEY DO LIKE THE WAY  THAT HE TRULY DOES LIE. AND ACTUALLY, HE LIES BADLY. I WAS -- ACTUALLY, LITTLE MARCO  HELPED ME A LOT.  MARCO -- IN ONE OF THE DEBATES  HE SCREAMED ACROSS ME.  I HAVE BEEN IN THE CENTER.  NEVER OUT OF CENTER.  I ALWAYS LIKE AN ODD NUMBER.  WITH AN EVEN NUMBER I HATED IT  BECAUSE WE HAD FOUR PEOPLE SO  I'M NOT IN THE CENTER.  WE SHOULD ALWAYS KEEP IT ODD NUMBERS.  I HAVE BEEN IN THE CENTER FOR  EVERY SINGLE DEBATE.  MARCO HELPED ME A LOT BECAUSE HE  CALLED TED CRUZ A LIAR. HE SAID HE IS A LIAR.  THAT IS THE FIRST TIME. LOOK, I KNOW POLITICIANS BETTER  THAN ANYBODY.  THEY ARE LIARS.  THEY ARE SERIOUS LIARS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEY WILL  NEVER GET YOU TO THE PROMISED LAND.  THEY WILL NOT DO IT.  THEY ARE CONTROLLED BY SPECIAL  INTEREST IN THE PEOPLE THAT PUT  UP ALL THIS MONEY FOR THEM TO RUN.  DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WAS  SPENT IN THE LAST WEEK ON ME?  YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES THEY WERE ASKING, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING TO THEIR SUPER PACS, HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU THINK MARCO  RUBIO AND TED CRUZ AND ALL OF  THEM WERE CALLING THEIR SUPER PA'S?  IS THAT RIGHT? IT IS CALLED LIFE. TALK TO THEIR SUPER PACS.  THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BUT  THAT IS THE WAY LIFE FOR US.  WE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING AND  CLEAN THE SLATE.  I THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO WELL  IN FLORIDA.  IT IS MY SECOND HOME.  I LOVE FLORIDA.  I LOVE FLORIDA.  I LOVE FLORIDA.  A SPECIAL PLACE.  AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO  WELL. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO  REALLY WELL IN FLORIDA. NOW THAT I HAVE PAUL O'NEILL'S  ENDORSEMENT I KNOW I'M GOING TO WIN.  I LOVE OHIO.  I HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS.  IT IS AN AMAZING PLACE.  AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT  OF FUN.  WE ARE GOING TO BE HILLARY CLINTON, PETER -- BEAT HER BADLY.  I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS --  THEN WE WILL TAKE SOME  QUESTIONS, ONE OF THE THINGS I  ADD THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT.  WE TALK ABOUT THE FIVE AND  SOMETIMES 6, THE FIVE STATES YOU  HAVE TO GET.  WHETHER IT IS OHIO,  PENNSYLVANIA, FLORIDA. THE REPUBLICANS, IT IS TOUGHER  FOR A REPUBLICAN TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY.  LIKE, BY A FACTOR OF FIVE. I HAVE THINGS OTHERS CAN'T DO.  I HAVE A CHANCE OF NEW YORK.  ALL THOSE DELEGATES, UPSTATE NEW  YORK, I POLL HIGHER THAN ANYBODY EVER.  THEY ARE IN TROUBLE UP THERE.  AND THEY KNOW I WOULD HAVE DONE THINGS, AND THEY WOULDN'T BE IN  TROUBLE IF THEY HAD TAKEN MY ADVICE.  I WILL GET MICHIGAN. I WILL GET MICHIGAN. WE ARE GOING TO BRING THE CAR INDUSTRY BACK. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE IT BACK. WE'RE GOING TO BRING THE CAR  INDUSTRY BACK INTO MICHIGAN.  I'M GOING TO WIN MICHIGAN. IT IS NOT EVEN THE QUESTION.  THE CANDIDATES ARE TALKING ABOUT  RUNNING, IT IS NEVER EVEN A  QUESTION. MICHIGAN IS NOT SOMETHING THEY  EVEN TALK ABOUT.  I WILL WIN NEW JERSEY, OHIO. FLORIDA.  I WILL WIN VIRGINIA. I HAVE GREAT PROPERTIES IN VIRGINIA. CHARLOTTESVILLE, WE JUST TALKED  ABOUT THE WINERY IN VIRGINIA. ON THE POTOMAC RIVER, ONE OF THE  GREAT PIECES OF PROPERTY IN THE WORLD. 600 ACRES, VERY SUCCESSFUL  PLACE.  A LOT OF EMPLOYEES IN VIRGINIA.  IT SEEMS WHEN I HAVE SOMETHING  IN A LOCATION, WHEN I AM IN  VIRGINIA, I HAVE A LOT OF EMPLOYEES, IN FLORIDA WHERE I  HAVE DORAL. ADAM SCOTT, TWO DAYS, HOW GREAT WAS THAT? HE IS A GREAT YOUNG MAN. THE WAY HE WON THE TOURNAMENT,  THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP, IT MEANS  YOU LOVE THIS STATE. IT MEANS YOU HAVE A LOT OF EMPLOYEES.  YOU PAY THE EMPLOYEES.  YOU TAKE CARE OF THE EDUCATION  FOR THEIR FAMILIES. YOU TAKE CARE OF SO MANY THINGS.  YOU JUST DO WELL.  SO, I THINK I'M GOING TO DO  GREAT THERE. I WANT TO DO GREAT IN OHIO.  I REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. I'M GOING TO BE WORKING HARD  BETWEEN THE TWO.  I HAVE ONE OF THE GREATEST BUILDINGS IN THE WORLD IN CHICAGO.  RATED THE NUMBER ONE HOTEL IN  NORTH AMERICA.  AND I'M VERY PROUD OF IT.  RIGHT ON THE RIVER, IT IS A  GREAT BUILDING. MAYBE THAT IS WHERE WE HAVE OUR  NEXT NEWS CONFERENCE. MAYBE WE WILL DO IT IN CHICAGO. SO, LET'S SEE WHAT THE PRESS HAS  TO ASK AND THEN WE WILL GO HOME  AND GO CELEBRATE A LOT OF VICTORIES. GO AHEAD. CBS.  YOU HAVE TO WIN.  I KNOW HOW TO WIN.  THESE PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU.  HAVE I WON MANY CHAMPIONSHIPS? STAND UP.  STAND UP.  HAVE I WON MANY CLUB CHAMPIONSHIPS? DOES TRUMP KNOW HOW TO CLOSE?  WINNING IS WINNING. IT IS NOT EASY TO WIN CLUB CHAMPIONSHIPS. NO STROKES. I LIKE TO CLOSE THINGS OUT. UNTIL THE LAST PERSON IS GONE, WE STARTED WITH A FIELD OF 17. NOW, WE ARE DOWN TO 4. I REALLY WANTED TO CLOSE THINGS OUT.  I HAVE NOT EVEN FOCUSED ON HILLARY YEAH.  NUMEROUS POLLS HAVE ME WINNING,  BUT I HAVE NOT EVEN STARTED. OTHER THAN WHAT I SAID A FEW WEEKS AGO, BECAUSE WHAT SHE SAID WAS REALLY WRONG.  IN MANY CASES, I HAVE ALL NIGHT. YOU HAVE TO GO ON FOR HOURS. HILLARY IS GOING TO BE VERY EASY  TO BE.  SHE IS A VERY FLAWED CANDIDATE,  VERY FLAWED CANDIDATE. I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE A  VERY, VERY EASY TARGET.  IF SHE IS ALLOWED TO RUN.  BECAUSE THERE IS A REAL QUESTION  AS TO WHETHER OR NOT SHE IS  GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO RUN.  IF THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO DO  ITS JOB PROPERLY, SHE WILL NOT  BE ALLOWED TO RUN.  GO AHEAD, TOM.  I HAVE NO MESSAGE FOR MARCO RUBIO.  I HAVE NO MESSAGE. I ACTUALLY HAVE A GOOD  RELATIONSHIP WITH MARCO, BELIEVE OR NOT. HE BECAME HOSTILE A FEW WEEKS AGO.  HOSTILITY WORKS FOR SOME PEOPLE.  IT DOESN'T WORK FOR EVERYONE.  HE BECAME VERY HOSTILE.  YOU KNOW WHAT, IT DOESN'T WORK  FOR HIM.  HE WAS BETTER, HAD HE KEPT THE  ORIGINAL PITTER PATTER GOING. BUT THIS DID NOT WORK.  SALE LITTLE LOUDER, TOM?  PART OF THE  BEAUTY, I HAVE MORE MONEY THAN ALL OF THEM, PUT TOGETHER TIMES 20.  I'M A BUSINESSMAN. WHY SHOULD I SPEND THE MONEY? I HAVE SPENT PROBABLY 25-30 $5  MILLION. YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS. IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, I SPENT A  MILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS.  SOMEONE ELSE SPENT $48 MILLION.  WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF WE HAD A  COUNTRY THAT WORKS THAT WAY?  SO, THE CNN POLL CAME OUT, AND I  WAS 41. IN FACT, I WAS 49.  SECOND IS 15 AND 15.  YOU KNOW, I HAVE SPENT LESS  MONEY THAN ANYBODY ELSE.  NOW, THE PHONY WALL STREET  JOURNAL POLL CAME OUT.  IF YOU REMEMBER THE POLL FROM SOUTH CAROLINA, IT WAS THE PHONY AND MOST DISGUSTING POLL I'VE  EVER SEEN.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT POLL. I DON'T KNOW WHO IS MAKING OF  THAT POLL. THEY SHOULD NOT PAY THAT BILL. I NEVER PAY BILLS WHEN SOMEBODY DOES A BAD JOB. THEY DID SUCH A BAD JOB DURING  THE SOUTH CAROLINA RUN.  THEY HAD ME PRACTICALLY DYING IN  SOUTH CAROLINA. THE DAY BEFORE, I MEAN THEY DID  THAT WITH VICIOUSNESS AND VINDICTIVENESS. AND IT LOOKED LIKE I WAS IN TROUBLE. THEN, I WON IN A LANDSLIDE. THE POLL WAS WRONG. THE FOLLOWING DAY, THEY CAME OUT WITH A NATIONAL POLL THAT WAS RIDICULOUS. NBC, CHUCK TODD, THEY CANNOT GET  ANOTHER ONE.  NBC JUMPED ON IT.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH THEM?  THAT'S NOT RIGHT. CNN CAME OUT WITH A PULL.  49, A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO. BOY, DID THEY TURN OUT TO BE  WRONG TO SOUTH CAROLINA. GO AHEAD.   I WAS CONCERNED  WITH THAT UNTIL I SAW IT.  I THINK IT IS BETTER THAN ANY AD  I HAVE TAKEN FOR MYSELF.   DO YOU KNOW WHY?  I REALLY MEAN IT. LET ME TELL YOU WHY.  I HEARD ABOUT THE AD. I SAID, I AM NOT GOING TO LIKE  IT. WHEN THEY LOOKED AT IT -- BY THE  WAY, I CAN BE MORE PRESIDENTIAL  THAN ANYBODY.  I CAN BE MORE PRESIDENTIAL IF I  WANT TO BE.  WHEN I HAVE 16 PEOPLE COMING AT ME FROM 16 DIFFERENT ANGLES, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SO  PRESIDENTIAL. YOU HAVE TO WIN, YOU HAVE TO BE  THEM BACK. I WOULD SAY MORE PRESIDENTIAL -- AND I HAVE SAID THIS A COUPLE OF  TIMES -- MORE PRESIDENTIAL,  OTHER THAN THE GREAT ABE  LINCOLN.  I SAW THAT AD. PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF BEING POLITICALLY CORRECT. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT AD IS GOOD  FOR ME.   IN SOME CASES AS YOU KNOW, I WAS KIDDING.  I HAVE A BIG AUDIENCE.  I WAS JOKING. IN OTHER CASES, I WAS SHOWING ANGER AND SHOWING A CERTAIN  TOUGHNESS WE NEED IN OUR  COUNTRY. BUT I WATCHED THAT AD AND I  SAID, YOU KNOW THAT AD SHOWS A  CERTAIN DEGREE OF ANGER AND IT SHOWS A CERTAIN DEGREE OF, WE  ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT  ANYMORE. THEY HAVE BEEN RIPPING US OFF  LIKE WE ARE A BUNCH OF STUPID BABIES.  I DON'T THINK IT IS A BAD AD FOR  ME.  IF I HAD MY CHOICE OF SAYING I  COULD HAVE IT DOWN OR LET IT  RUN, LET IT RUN.   YOU ARE SO  POLITICALLY CORRECT. LOOK AT YOU.  I KNOW.  YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD A LITTLE  OFF LANGUAGE OR YOU ARE SO  PERFECT.  AREN'T YOU JUST A PERFECT YOUNG  MAN? GIVE ME A BREAK.  IT IS STUFF LIKE THAT THAT  PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE TIRED OF.  IT IS STUFF LIKE THAT.    I HEAR $39 MILLION HAS BEEN SPENT.  I AM VERY SURPRISED. I LOOKED AT THE NUMBERS AND MISSISSIPPI HAD 50%.  THAT IS NOT 50% WITH TWO PEOPLE.  THAT IS 50% WITH 4 PEOPLE.  THAT IS SHOCKING. THAT IS RECORD-SETTING. A BIG DIFFERENCE. IF YOU ARE RUNNING LIKE HILLARY  AND ARE RUNNING AGAINST ONE GUY -- YOU ARE RUNNING AGAINST BERNIE. AND YOU GET A 50%-50 2% -- I  AM RUNNING AGAINST THREE VERY  COMPETENT PEOPLE AND I AM  GETTING 50%. IN MICHIGAN I'M CLOSE TO 40%  AGAINST A BIG GROUP OF PEOPLE.  I WILL SAY THIS.  I AM A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED -- I WAS AT THE RAIL -- I WAS  WATCHING ADAM SCOTT HIT THAT  LAST GREAT SHOT. I WENT BACK AND I WAS WATCHING  THE NEWS IN ONE OF THE ROOMS AND  EVERY SINGLE ADVERTISEMENT WAS  ABOUT ME. IT WAS DURING MY TOURNAMENT.  I GO FROM TOURNAMENT TO HORRIBLE  MAN. THE MOST VICIOUS ADS.  ONE OF THE REASONS I BROUGHT THE  WINE OUT AND THE WATER OUT AND  THE STEAK OUT, AND MORE WINE AND MORE WATER -- AND I TOLD YOU  ABOUT TRUMP UNIVERSITY. WE ARE GOING TO WIN THAT CA  SE. IT WILL BE EASY. THEY HIT ME WITH THIS TRUMP UNIVERSITY.  WE'RE GOING TO WIN THE CASE.  I COULD SETTLE THE CASE SO EASILY.  I DON'T WANT TO SETTLE IT.  IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR ME TO  SETTLE IT. I WOULD NOT HAVE ALL OF YOU  PEOPLE WRITING ABOUT IT. BUT I DON'T WANT TO SETTLE IT. THE FACT IS, YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT  IS RIGHT. AND IF YOU LIVE BY PRINCIPAL -- AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I AM A  VERY HIGHLY PRINCIPLED PERSON. IF YOU LIVE BY PRINCIPAL, YOU  ARE GOING TO DO VERY WELL.   I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED WHEN I SAW THE VICIOUSNESS OF THE ADS, AND VICIOUSNESS OF -- REALLY , MITT  WAS VERY VICIOUS. I WISH TO USE THAT SAME ENERGY  AGAINST OBAMA. I THINK HE WOULD HAVE WON.  IF HE USED THE SAME ENERGY  AGAINST OBAMA, HE WOULD HAVE  WON. CARL?  I SAY, LET'S COME  TOGETHER, FOLKS. LET'S COME TOGETHER.  THE ANSWER IS NOT 100%, BUT  LARGELY I WITH SAY YES. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I AM A  UNIFIER. I UNIFY. LOOK AT ALL OF THE THINGS I  BUILT AROUND THE WORLD.  I AM A UNIFIER. I GET ALONG WITH PEOPLE. I HAVE GREAT RELATIONS. I EVEN STARTED GETTING ALONG  WITH YOU, RIGHT?  CAMPAIGN CARL. BUT NO, I GET ALONG WITH PEOPLE. I REALLY SAY THIS, CARL, I THINK  IT IS TIME TO UNIFY. WE HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL IN THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY. UNFORTUNATELY, THE PEOPLE IN THE PARTY -- THEY CALL THEM THE ELITES OR WHATEVER THEY CALL THEM -- THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T RESPECT IT YET. WE HAVE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE -- WE DISCUSSED THIS  BEFORE. WE HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE COMING UP AND VOTING -- LARGELY FOR ME, IN ALL FAIRNESS, BUT FOR  OTHER PEOPLE ALSO. CARL, YOU KNOW THIS BECAUSE YOU  HAVE REPORTED ON IT. IT IS A RECORD.  IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. IN 100 YEARS, WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS  NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. THE PARTY -- WHETHER YOU CALL THEM THE ESTABLISHMENT OR NOT --  THEY SHOULD EMBRACE IT. THE DEMOCRATS WOULD LOVE TO HAVE  WHAT IS HAPPENING. I HAVE FRIENDS ON THE OTHER  SIDE. THEY SAY, BOY, WOULD WE LIKE  THAT TO HAPPEN.  THEY ARE DOWN 35%.  THERE IS NO SPIRIT THERE.  WE ARE WAY UP WITH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. WHAT I SAY TO THE REPUBLICANS  IS, EMBRACE IT.  WE WILL WIN THE ELECTION EASILY.  >> IN YOUR WORDS, MITT ROMNEY  AND LINDSEY GRAHAM HAVE BEEN  ATTACKING YOU VICIOUSLY. HOW CAN YOU WIN THEM BACK?  YOU DON'T HAVE TO  WIN BACK EVERYBODY.  I'M NOT CHANGING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BECAUSE I  AM A CONSERVATIVE.  I AM A COMMONSENSE CONSERVATIVE.  NOBODY IS MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN  ME ON ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR  YEARS. NOBODY IS MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN  ME ON THE MILITARY. NOBODY IS MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN  ME ON TAKING CARE OF OUR GREAT  VETERANS WHO ARE BEING  ABSOLUTELY MALIGNED.  NOBODY IS MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN  ME ON HEALTH CARE, WHERE WE ARE  GOING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE  OBAMACARE, AND ON COMMON CORE -- WE ARE GETTING RID OF THAT. AND ON BUDGETS, WHETHER IT IS  THE PENNY DEAL.  OR ANYTHING ELSE. WE OWE WE'RE GOING TO PAY OFF $19 TRILLION. DEBT. WERE NOT GOING TO PAY THAT OFF QUICKLY, BUT WE HAVE TO START  BRINGING IT DOWN TO A LEVEL THAT  IS SUSTAINABLE BECAUSE WE ARE  GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. CERTAINLY, NOBODY IS MORE  CONSERVATIVE THAN ME ON THE  BORDER.  THE ONE THING I THINK PEOPLE CAN  SAY IS THAT ON TRADE, I AM A  FREE TRADER, BELIEVE IT OR NOT.  BUT I AM ALSO A SMART TRADER.  WE CANNOT LET CHINA -- AND I  LIKE CHINA, THEY ARE WONDERFUL. BUT THEIR LEADERS ARE TOO SMART FOR OUR LEADERS.  I DID GREAT WITH CHINA. THE BANK OF AMERICA I HAVE  IS BECAUSE OF CHINA.  I WILL TELL YOU, NOBODY IS MORE  CONSERVATIVE ON TRADE. THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS YOU HAVE  PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE NATIONAL  REVIEW, THEY ARE EGGHEADS. THEY HAVE NO COMMON SENSE WHATSOEVER. NO COMMON SENSE WHATSOEVER.  IT IS NOT FREE TRADE WHEN CHINA  CHARGES TAX TO GET OUR PRODUCTS AND THEY DON'T LET OUR PROJECT IN ANY WAY. AND YET, THEY TAKE THEIR PRODUCT AND SEND IT TO US LIKE NOTHING. WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA OF $500 BILLION A YEAR. WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT WITH  JAPAN OF OVER $100 BILLION A YEAR.  WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT WITH  MEXICO. THAT IS WHY MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL. $58 BILLION A YEAR, 100%. THESE GUYS, THAT I'M AGAINST AND THEY SAY, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO  GET MEXICO TO PAY FOR THE WALL.  I SAY, OF COURSE I AM. WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT WITH MEXICO OF $58 BILLION A YEAR. THE WALL IS GOING TO COST $10 BILLION.  OUR YOU TELLING ME I CAN'T MAKE  THAT DEAL? THAT IS AN EASY DEAL.   THE ONLY THING, CARL -- I LOVE THE QUESTION. THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY, SOME PEOPLE SAY I AM A CONSERVATIVE  ON TRADE. I WANT FREE TRADE.  FREE TRADE, YOU HAVE TO HAVE  SMART PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES AND  WE DON'T HAVE SMART PEOPLE ON  OUR SIDE.  I WANT FAIR TRADE. IT HAS TO BE FAIR TRADE -- OR AS  YOU WOULD SAY, FAIR AND BALANCED TRADE. JEREMY, GO AHEAD.  DESTROYED.  I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE  GOING TO SAY. NOBODY IS LISTENING TO YOU,  JEREMY. NOBODY EVER LISTENS TO YOU. THE PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH TRADE -- JEREMY, LET ME JUST SAY. WE HAVE PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE  THAT ARE GRANDMASTERS AT  MONETARY MANIPULATION, AT  CURRENCY MANIPULATION.  THEY ARE MANIPULATING CURRENCY  TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT OUR  COMPANIES CANNOT COMPETE WITH  OTHER COMPANIES IN OTHER  NATIONS. THE CAUSE OF THAT, WE ARE LOSING OUR JOBS.  TAKE A LOOK AT HOW MANY JOBS CHINA HAS TAKEN FROM US. IT IS NOT JUST CHINA -- IT IS  EVERYBODY. BUT CHINA IS THE BIG ABUSER.  CHINA HAS TAKEN MILLIONS OF  JOBS, THOUSANDS OF FACTORIES. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US -- I  THOUGHT ABOUT IT THE OTHER DAY.  IT IS THE GREATEST THEFT IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.  THEY HAVE TAKEN OUT SO MUCH  MONEY. AGAIN, I LOVE CHINA. IT IS GREAT.  I DON'T HOLD ANYTHING AGAINST  THEIR LEADERS.  I WISH OUR LEADERS WOULD DO THE  SAME THING IN REVERSE BUT THEY  DON'T. WE CANNOT CONTINUE.  I WON MICHIGAN AND I WENT UP THERE.  THESE PEOPLE ARE INCREDIBLE  PEOPLE. TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE FACTORIES THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED THEIR, WHERE THEY  MOVED INTO MEXICO. TAKE A LOOK AT CHICAGO, WHERE NABISCO MOVED ITS BIG PLAN --  THEY ARE CLOSING THEIR PLANT AND  MOVING TO MEXICO. FORTIS BILLING A $2.5 BILLION FACTORY IN MEXICO. A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, CARRIER  ANNOUNCED THEY ARE GOING TO  CLOSE.  THEY ARE GOING TO PUT THEIR AIR  CONDITIONERS IN MEXICO.  HOW DOES THAT HELP US?   CAN I TELL YOU  WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? WHEN CHINA THINKS YOU MEAN IT , WHEN THEY THINK YOU MEAN IT,  THEY ARE GOING TO STOP MANIPULATING THEIR CURRENCY AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. YOU MIGHT EVEN HAVE FREE TRADE.   YOU DIDN'T HEAR  ME. WHEN CHINA THINKS YOU MEAN IT,  WHEN JAPAN THINKS YOU MEAN IT --  THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET  THEM SELL THE CARS LIKE THAT  BECAUSE THEY ARE KILLING US. YOU KNOW WHAT WE SELL TO JAPAN? PRACTICALLY NOTHING. THEY HAVE CARS COMING IN BY THE MILLIONS AND WE SELL PRACTICALLY NOTHING.  WHEN JAPAN THINKS WE MEAN IT,  THEY WILL STOP PLAYING AROUND  WITH THE YEN. THEY ARE ALMOST AS GOOD AS CHINA. YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH KOMATSU TRACTOR AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH CATERPILLAR. CATERPILLAR IS BEING HURT BY CAMACHO.  CATERPILLAR MAKES A BETTER  MACHINE. WE CAN'T HAVE THE MINUTE RELATION OF THE CURRENCY.  THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO IT.  THEY HAVE NO FEAR OF OUR  GOVERNMENT.  WE ARE DEALING WITH BABIES. THEY ARE GRANDMASTER PLAYERS AND WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT BE  NEGOTIATING FOR US.  ONE MORE QUESTION. GO AHEAD. [INAUDIBLE  I AM GOING TO  FINISH WITH HER BECAUSE SHE  NEVER ASKS A DECENT QUESTION.  I THINK LINDSEY  GRAHAM IS PROBABLY A NICE GUY. I WAS VERY TOUGH ON HIM BECAUSE HE WAS TOUGH ON ME.  I THINK HE IS PROBABLY A NICE GUY.  I COULD PROBABLY GET ALONG WITH  LINDSEY GRAHAM.  I COULD PROBABLY GET ALONG WITH  MITT ROMNEY. I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST MITT ROMNEY AND I UNDERSTAND HOW HE FEELS.  HE WORKED REALLY HARD. HE SHOULD HAVE WORKED HARDER. BUT HE WORKED REALLY HARD.  AND HE DIDN'T GET THERE. I UNDERSTAND IT. I COULD PROBABLY GET ALONG WITH  MITT ROMNEY. I DON'T KNOW MITT ROMNEY VERY  WELL. I ENDORSED HIM. I BACKED HIM, I HELPED HIM, BUT I DON'T KNOW MITT ROMNEY. I COULD PROBABLY GET ALONG WELL LINDSEY GRAHAM, BUT HE GOES ON TELEVISION AND IS NASTY.  I CAN GET ALONG WITH PEOPLE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, WE HAVE  SOMETHING GOING THAT IS SO GOOD.  WE SHOULD GRAB EACH OTHER AND  UNIFY THE PARTY.  AND NOBODY IS GOING TO BEAT US,  OK?

HE'S A DISASTER. HE'S A NASTY GUY, SAYS NASTY THINGS. YOU KNOW, WE HIT HIM HARD. WE HIT HIM HARD. LITTLE NASTY GUY. HE EVEN COMPLAINED ABOUT MY HANDS, LOOK AT THOSE HANDS, LOOK AT THOSE HANDS, LOOK AT THAT. YOU KNOW, I HIT HIM ONLY AS A RESPONSE TO HIM. AND HE IS LOOKING AND SAY, WHAT CAN I SAY, WHAT CAN I SAY. HE SAYS, ""HE'S GOT SMALL HANDS."" I MEAN, GIVE ME A BREAK, OK? I SAY TO MYSELF, WHERE DID HE GET THAT FROM? WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?

I DID NOT WANT TO GO THE REST OF MY LIFE EVERYONE SAYING I HAVE SMALL HANDS. I HAVE HEARD OF WORSE THINGS, BUT WHO NEEDS IT? OK? I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL, REALLY. LOOK AT THIS CROWD. ALL THE WAY UP TO THE RAFTERS. ALL THE WAY UP. UNBELIEVABLE. UNBELIEVABLE. THE FIRE MARSHAL, WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE. WE LOST ABOUT 10,000 PEOPLE. THEY HAVE HAD TO LEAVE. BUT WE STILL HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, AT A THINK BECAUSE THE POLICE ARE SO INCREDIBLE, WE LOVE OUR POLICE.   AND YOUR FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND EVERYTHING. THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO LET ANOTHER FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE COME RIGHT UP HERE. I SAID DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY PROBLEMS. OK? SO, WE ARE GOING TO FILL IT IN THE END IT IS GREAT. YOU KNOW, THE ONES I WORK WITH MOST WHEN I GO TO A SITE ARE FIRE MARSHALS. THEY'RE THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE, BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT LET US BACK. YOU TAKE A LOOK TODAY, HERE IS A DAY -- IN ALL FAIRNESS TO YOU, RIGHT NOW I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AT THE CATALOG WORLD GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS AT TRUMP NATIONAL, AND I'M HERE.   I AM HERE. AND I JUST LEFT KANSAS, AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL DO WELL IN KANSAS, AND KENTUCKY. AND YOU KNOW I HAVE A LIST. LOOK AT THIS, NEW HAMPSHIRE, WE WON. SOUTH CAROLINA, WE WON. NEVADA, WE WON IN A MASSIVE LANDSLIDE. THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR LYIN' TED CRUZ. HE HOLDS UP THE BIBLE AND THEN HE PUTS IT DOWN AND HE LIES. I DON'T LIKE THAT. AND THAT IS WHY I AM WAITING VIRTUALLY EVERY CATEGORY WITH THE EVANGELICALS WHO I LOVE -- I AM WINNING VIRTUALLY EVERY CATEGORY WITH THE EVANGELICALS WHO I LOVE. PASTOR PAULA WHITE WAS SO GREAT. AND YOU KNOW, JERRY FALWELL, JUNIOR, FROM LIBERTY UNIVERSITY WAS SO GREAT TO ME. HE DOESN'T ENDORSE PEOPLE, BUT HE FELT THIS WAS IMPORTANT. AND REMEMBER, EVERY ONE OF THE CANDIDATES GOES TO LIBERTY. WHEN HE ENDORSED ME THAT WAS A GREAT THING. SO WE WON NEVADA BIG. WE WON GEORGIA IN A LANDSLIDE. WE WON TENNESSEE REALLY BIG, WE WON ALABAMA IN A MASSIVE LANDSLIDE. WE WON -- VERMONT WAS INCREDIBLE. VERMONT, EVERYBODY THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE MARCO. MARCO DIDN'T EVEN SHOW UP. BY THE WAY, HE DOESN'T SHOW UP TO VOTE FOR THE SENATE, SO WHY THE HELL SHOULD HE SHOW UP TO VERMONT? YEAH? WE WON VIRGINIA, WE WON ARKANSAS, WE WON MASSACHUSETTS.   MANY POLLS HAVE COME OUT THAT I EASILY BEAT HILLARY CLINTON. YOU DON'T HEAR THAT ON TELEVISION. YOU HEAR THESE DISHONEST PUNDITS. WELL, TRUMP WINS THE GENERAL ELECTION, WE WILL BEAT HER SO BADLY. WE WILL BE HURT SO BADLY -- BEAT HER SO BADLY. I USED TO LISTEN TO JEB BUSH AND HE WOULD SAY DONALD TRUMP CANNOT BEAT HILLARY CLINTON, AND I WOULD SAY WHY CAN'T YOU BEAT ME? RIGHT? HE GOT NOTHING. LOW-ENERGY. LOW-ENERGY. AND THERE'S PEOPLE ON TELEVISION FIGHTING ME, SAYING, WE HAVE TO STOP DONALD TRUMP. HE IS NOT GOING TO BEAT HILLARY CLINTON. THEY WORK FOR JEB BUSH. THEY WORK FOR JEB BUSH. I SAY TO MY PEOPLE, WHY DON'T THEY JUST SAY THEY WORK FOR JEB BUSH? THEY WERE TERRIBLE. I SEE IT ALL THE TIME. THE ONE PERSON THAT HILLARY DOESN'T WANT TO RUN AGAINST, I WILL TELL YOU THIS, IS DONALD TRUMP. THAT I CAN TELL YOU.   THAT I CAN TELL YOU. AND IT'S AMAZING, I WATCHED THE OTHER DAY WHERE LITTLE MARCO IS GOING, ""WELL, DONALD WILL NOT WIN."" I DON'T THINK HE WILL COME CLOSE TO WINNING HIS OWN STATE. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE THIS? I'M 21 POINTS UP. AND I LOVE FLORIDA. TRULY MY SECOND HOME. I'M HERE ALL THE TIME. AS YOU KNOW, ALL THE TIME. I LOVE THIS AREA, BY THE WAY. BUT I AM HERE ALL THE TIME. I'VE DONE MANY JOBS IN MIAMI WITH GEORGE PEREZ AND MICHAEL DESERT. WE HAVE HAD GREAT SUCCESS. WE HAVE MANY BUILDINGS IN MIAMI. A LOT OF STUFF. AND IT HAS BEEN GREAT. AND IN JUPITER WE DID A GREAT JOB. AND IN WEST PALM BEACH WE DID A BIG JOB. AND MANY MORE. IN FACT TONIGHT WE ARE HAVING A NEWS CONFERENCE, HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A VICTORY CONFERENCE IN WEST PALM BEACH. HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A VICTORY CONFERENCE IN WEST PALM BEACH. OF ALL THE PLACES I COULD PICK I PICKED FLORIDA. I LOVE FLORIDA. WE ALL LOVE FLORIDA. I HEAR THESE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE GENERAL ELECTION. THE GENERAL ELECTION IS IMPORTANT AND I'M GOING THE ONE -- I'M THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO BE THERE. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS. THE ONE PERSON SHE DOES NOT WANT TO RUN AGAINST IS TRUMP. SHE GOT A DOSE. FOLKS, I'M BEATING HER IN MANY POLLS AND I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED YET. I HAVEN'T STARTED WITH HER YET. ONLY ONCE. FOUR WEEKS AGO SHE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT ME BEING SEXIST. REMEMBER? I WILL TELL YOU, THE PRESS TREATED ME VERY UNFAIRLY, BECAUSE RIGHT AFTER SHE SAID THAT I ATTACKED HER AND BILL, AND BILL, WE CAME UP WITH THE WORD, TRUE WORD, ""ENABLER."" YOU KNOW WHAT AND A BLU-RAY IS? AND WE TALKED ABOUT BILL AND I SAID, YOU MEAN TO TELL ME I AM BAD BUT HER HUSBAND IS OK? MAYBE ONE OF THE WORST IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS. THIS WAS A DISASTER FOR THEM. I GUARANTEE YOU, THEY HAD ONE OF THE WORST WEEKENDS OF THEIR LIFE. THIS WAS NOT A FRIENDLY WEEKEND THEY HAD SITTING TOGETHER AT HOME WHEREVER THEY ARE AT HOME IF THEY ARE TOGETHER. SO HERE'S THE STORY, HERE'S THE STORY. WE CAN'T PLAY GAMES. OUR COUNTRY IS IN DEEP TROUBLE. WE HAVE TO BEAT HER. IT LOOKS LIKE SHE IS GOING TO MAKE IT. BERNIE IS GONE. REGARDLESS. BERNIE HAD HIS TIME. HE HAD HIS TIME IN THE SUN, AND I SEE THIS SO OFTEN WITH POLITICIANS. THEY BLOW IT. WHAT HAPPENS, HE HAD HIS TIME IN THE SUN, HE WAS DOING GREAT, AND THEN THEY ASKED HIM THE QUESTION ABOUT E-MAILS A MONTH AND A HALF AGO. AND HE SAID, I'M TIRED OF DISCUSSING IT. I SAID BYE-BYE BERNIE. YOU JUST BLEW THE ELECTION. AND I WAS RIGHT. BUT WHEN I ATTACKED HILLARY, AND PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THIS, THAT THE PRESS GAVE ME A ZERO. YOU KNOW AND UNDERSTAND, THEY ARE THE MOST DISHONEST HUMAN BEINGS ON EARTH. THEY ARE DISGUSTING DISHONEST HUMAN BEINGS. NOT ALL OF THEM. ACTUALLY, AMAZINGLY, BECAUSE I'M NO FAN OF THE NEW YORK TIMES, I HAD A FRONT-PAGE STORY TODAY ON THE NEW YORK TIMES. IT WAS A PHENOMENAL STORY, I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.   GET THEM OUT OF HERE. GET THEM OUT! WE HAD AN AMAZING, AMAZING STORY ON THE FRONT PAGE. I AM GOING TO HAVE TO BE NICER TO THE NEW YORK TIMES, YOU KNOW? TODAY WAS AMAZING BECAUSE SOMEBODY SAID THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING LIKE THIS HAPPENING WITH THIS MOVEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES FOR OVER 100 YEARS, COULD YOU IMAGINE? OVER 100 YEARS. THE MATTER WHERE WE GO, WE HAVE THE BIGGEST AUDIENCES, THE BIGGEST CROWDS BY FAR. I MUST TELL YOU, BERNIE WAS SECOND, A DISTANT SECOND, BUT BERNIE WAS SECOND. WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE? COME ON, GET THEM OUT FAST. WE WANT SPEED! OH LOOK, THERE HE IS. LITTLE WISEGUY. LITTLE WISEGUY. A LOT OF GUTS, A LOT OF GUTS. I WONDER WHO SENT HIM IN. YOU KNOW, THEY ARE SENDING THAT MEN, BY THE WAY. BUT I LOVE MY PROTESTERS. BECAUSE THESE GUYS NEVER MOVE IT THE CAMERAS. I CALL MY WIFE, SHE DID A GREAT JOB. BY THE WAY, HAS SHE DONE A GREAT JOB LATELY OR WHAT? WOULDN'T SHE BE A GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL FIRST LADY? AND SHE IS VERY SMART AND SHE HAS A BIG HEART. SHE HAS A GREAT HEART. BUT I LOVE MY PROTESTERS. I GO HOME AND SAY HOW DID YOU LIKE THE CROWD? SHE'LL SAY, I DID NOT SEE IT. I'LL SAY, WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DIDN'T SEE IT? I HEARD IT. WHEN YOU KNOW THIS CROWD YOU KNOW THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHERE WE HAVE OVER 10,000 PEOPLE NOT COME IN TODAY? BUT I PROMISE I'M GOING TO COME BACK. NONE OF YOU CAN COME HERE WHEN I COME BACK. I KNOW YOU GOT HERE AT 6:00 IN THE MORNING, MANY OF YOU. SO, PRETTY AMAZING. BUT WE ARE GOING TO COME BACK. BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE? I GO HOME AND I SAY, DID YOU SEE THE SIZE OF THAT CROWD? WE FILLED UP DALLAS. YOU KNOW, MARK CUBAN, THE DALLAS MAVERICKS ARE A WONDERFUL TEAM. THEY HAVE A BEAUTIFUL STADIUM. I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT WOULD BE GOOD. WE TOOK IT OVER ON THURSDAY, FILLED IT UP ON MONDAY. 20,000 PEOPLE, NOBODY KNEW. THE REASON THEY DIDN'T KNOW, THE REPORTERS DON'T WANT TO REPORT IT. THEY DON'T WANT TO SAY. THEY HAD A CASE WHERE BERNIE -- IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. THE ONLY TIME THEY MOVED THE CAMERA, IF THERE IS A PROTESTER UP, BECAUSE IT IS A NEGATIVE THING -- YOU KNOW WHAT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, WE HAVE A THING GOING ON HERE THAT IS INCREDIBLE. THERE HASN'T BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. THE BIGGEST STORY IN POLITICS, WHICH REALLY ISN'T TALKED ABOUT AS MUCH AS IT SHOULD BE IS VOTER TURNOUT DURING THE PRIMARIES. 50% UP, 60% UP, IN SOME CASES 100%. THERE IT IS CAMERAS. LOOK UP THERE AT THE PROTESTER CAMERA.  U.S.A.   U.S.A. ARE THE TRUMPET RALLIES THE GREATEST? YOU KNOW WHAT, WHEN LITTLE MARCO HAS A RALLY AND THEY GET 300 PEOPLE, 200 PEOPLE, IT IS FINE. I AM NOT KNOCKING IT. THAT IS SORT OF A NORMAL THING. THIS IS NOT A NORMAL SITUATION, THIS IS NOT A NORMAL SITUATION. SO IT HAS BEEN AN AMAZING PERIOD OF TIME FOR ME. YOU KNOW, ON I TOOK A DEEP JUNE 16, BREATH. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT SO EASY. I CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR, I SAID LET'S GO, WE HAVE TO STRAIGHTEN OUT -- GET OUT OF HERE, GET OUT, OUT!   -- MR. TRUMP: GO HOME TO MOMMY.   SO WHY IS IT THAT THAT YOUNG LADY CAN USE FILTHY DISGUSTING LANGUAGE, AND THEY WON'T REPORT THAT? AND IF I SAY SOME THING THAT'S NOT EVEN THERE, I END UP ON THE FRONT PAGE OF EVERY PAPER IN THE WORLD. THE YOU THINK THAT IS FAIR? SHE IS DISGUSTING. SHE IS DISGUSTING. IT REMINDS ME OF THIS LAST WEEKEND, THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF MEXICO, THE CHANT A FOX -- PRESIDENT OF MEXICO, VICENTE FOX --WE WILL BUILD THE WALL COME A DON'T WORRY. WE WILL BUILD THE WALL, DON'T WORRY. WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL?  WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT WITH MEXICO OF $58 BILLION. THESE POLITICIANS, LYING TED CRUZ AND LITTLE MARCO RUBIO -- HE NEVER SHOWS UP ANYWHERE, WHAT DOES HE DO WITH ALL HIS FREE TIME? HE HAS THE HIGHEST DELETE QUINCY RECORD IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND MANY MANY YEARS. THAT IS NOT WHO YOU WANT REPRESENTING FLORIDA. THAT IS NOT THE DEAL YOU MADE. LOOK, I WENT ALL OVER THE BEACH, ALL THESE THINGS. AND I HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS GUY, A TOTAL LIGHTWEIGHT, SAYING, ""DONALD TRUMP IS CON."" I FILED FINANCIAL PAY SHEER THAT -- FINANCIAL PAPERS SAYING I AM WORTH OVER $10 BILLION. SOME OF THE GREATEST ASSETS IN THE WORLD. TRUMP TOWER, BANK OF AMERICA, ALL OF THIS STUFF, ON OF THIS STUFF -- DON'T WORRY, GET THEM OUT. THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A BOYS. AND THEN I HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS LIGHTWEIGHT SAY I'M A CON MAN, NOBODY HAS EVER CALLED ME A CON MAN BEFORE. THAT'S A HORRIBLE THING. THEN WHEN I HIT HIM BACK, THEY SAY DONALD TRUMP WAS REALLY ROUGH. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, DID I KILL HIM IN THE DEBATE THE OTHER NIGHT? ONE OF THE ANNOUNCERS SAID DONALD GOT TO HIS HEAD. HE WAS REALLY OPT. AND I -- NOT ME, WE WON EVERY SINGLE POLL. ALMOST 70%. DRUDGE HAD AS AT ALMOST 70%. LOOK, WE NEED GREATNESS. WE DON'T NEED MEDIOCRITY. WE DON'T NEED IT. WE DON'T NEED UP PHONIES. WE DO NOT NEED POLITICIANS, ALL TALK, NO ACTION. GET THEM OUT! IS THIS FUN? I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! THOSE CAMERAS TURNING UP THERE. LOOK AT THEM. THEY ARE LIKE PRETZELS. THEY ARE LIKE PRETZELS. GOOD, GET THEM OUT. GO HOME. YOU'RE LUCKY. YOU'RE LUCKY IT'S NOT 10 YEARS AGO. 10 YEARS AGO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH TOUGHER SITUATION FOR HIM. YOU KNOW. IT'S DIFFERENT. YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, SPEAKING OF THAT, THEY TALK ABOUT WATERBOARDING AND ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT THINGS, RIGHT? AND WE HAVE TO OBEY THE LAWS. WE HAVE TO OBEY THE LAWS, BUT DO YOU THINK ISIS IS OBEYING THE LAWS? I SAY IT TO VERY STRONGLY.   --  I WISH WE HAD SOME REAL PROTESTERS. REMEMBER WHEN THOSE PROTESTERS CAME UP AND TOOK THE MICROPHONE FROM A BERNIE SANDERS? WHAT DID HE DO? HE RETREATED. HE WAS BACK HERE. THEY TOOK OVER THE MICROPHONE. I PROMISE, I'M REPRESENTING YOU. THE POLICE DID A GOOD JOB. THANK YOU POLICE, WE LOVE YOU. WE LOVE YOU! THEY DON'T PLAY GAMES. THE POLICE IN THIS COUNTRY, BELIEVE ME, THE POLICE ARE NOT TREATED FAIRLY. ONE ACT, WHICH WAS A MISTAKE, OR SOMEBODY IS A BAD APPLE, AND IT IS PLAYED IN THE NEWS ALL THE TIME. WE HAVE TO GIVE MORE CREDIT TO OUR POLICE, FOLKS. AND WE HAVE TO STICK WITH THEM. SO THEN ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE AND EVERYONE ELSE. WE HAVE MITT ROMNEY. WHO CHOKED IN THE LAST ELECTION. I NEVER THOUGHT HE WAS A SMART GUY, AND I KEEP WONDERING. I SEE HE IS WITH THE STEVE FORBES TODAY. THEY PUT ME DOWN AT $4.5 BILLION NET WORTH. I'M NOT COMPLAINING. BUT IT IS MUCH MORE THAN THAT. I SHOULD BE HAPPY, AND I AM HAPPY TO WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? THAT I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND, WHY ARE THE FOUR NUMBERS A MUCH LOWER THAN THE VALUE OF WHAT I BUILT? HOW ABOUT THIS IDIOT GETS UP, MY FATHER GAVE ME $200 MILLION -- 200 MILLION? I ONLY WISH. BECAUSE WE'D OWN THE WORLD. BUT I LIKE THIS BETTER. THIS IS MUCH BETTER. BUT I GOT A CALL FROM MY BROTHER AND SISTER. TWO GREAT PEOPLE. I LOVE THEM. AND THEY SAID, WHY DON'T YOU CORRECT HIM? THAT IS SO RIDICULOUS. IN FACT THEY SAID, IF HE GAVE YOU 200 MILLION, PLEASE LET US KNOW ABOUT IT, WE WOULD LIKE A CHUNK OF IT. I STARTED OFF WITH VERY LITTLE. I STARTED OFF WITH GREAT KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE I HAD A FATHER WHO WAS A GREAT GUY. I HAD A FATHER, WHO IF HAD SEEN THE IRAN DEAL, AND SO WE GAVE THEM $150 MILLION, AND YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE SPENDING THAT MONEY? BUYING AIRBUS JETS. 118 AIRBUS JETS. THEY ARE SPENDING IT ALL OVER EUROPE, SPENDING IT IN RUSSIA BUYING MISSILES. RIGHT? THEY'RE SPENDING IT IN RUSSIA BUYING MISSILES. AYERS SPENDING IT WITH EVERYBODY BUT THE GOOD OLD USA. IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE, FOLKS. IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. AND WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER AGREED TO NEGOTIATION. REMEMBER THE ART OF THE DEAL AND ALL THAT STUFF? WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER AGREED TO NEGOTIATE. FOUR YEARS AGO, THEY SHOULD HAVE RELEASED OUR LISTENERS. -- OUR PRISONERS. WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER EVER AGREED TO NEGOTIATE. ONE OF THE DUMBEST DEALS I HAVE EVER SEEN. THEY ADDED SOMEBODY FROM THE WASHINGTON POST. I WOULD HAVE GONE IN VERY EASILY. THEY WOULD HAVE SAID THAT IS NOT PRESIDENTIAL. LET ME NOT BE PRESIDENTIAL. OR WHEN OF MY GREAT REPRESENTATIVES. YOU HEARD ABOUT ALL OF THESE, CARL ICAHN AND THE GREAT BUSINESS PEOPLE. AND/OR SING ME. MANY OF THE GREATS. WE ARE GOING TO USE THEM TO NEGOTIATE OUR TRADE DEAL. THESE ARE THE GREATEST NEGOTIATORS IN THE WORLD, THESE ARE THE GREATEST BUSINESS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. THEY DON'T WANT ANYTHING, THEY DON'T GIVE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND SAY, NOW APPOINT ME TO CHIEF NEGOTIATOR AGAINST CHINA. CHINA IS SO SMART, AND MEXICO IS SO SMART. IF YOU LOOK AT JAPAN, THE DEALS THEY MADE ARE SO SMART. SAUDI ARABIA, THEY PROTECT SAUDI -- WE PROTECT SAUDI ARABIA. BEFORE THE DEAL WENT DOWN, THEY WERE MAKING $1 BILLION PER DAY AND WE PROTECT THEM FOR PEANUTS. IT'S ALL GOING TO CHANGE. IT'S ALL GOING TO CHANGE. IT'S ALL GOING TO CHANGE. AND IT'S GOING TO GO FAST. MY FATHER USED TO SAY, AND SOMEBODY IN THE BIG PAPERS LOVE THIS. MY FATHER USED TO SAY TO ME, ""YOU ARE TOO TOUGH, YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR LUMPS OUT."" THAT WAS THE EXPRESSION HE USED. HE WOULD SAY DONALD, YOU ARE TOO TOUGH, TAKE IT EASY. HE WOULD SAY TAKE THE LUMPS OUT. SOMEBODY PROTESTING BACK THERE ? GET THEM OUT A HERE! GET THEM OUT OF HERE! DON'T HURT HIM. DON'T HURT THEM. GET OUT OF HERE. GET OUT OF HERE. YEAH. SURE. SURE, MAN. YOU HAD YOUR FIVE SECONDS OF FAME. DON'T HURT HIM. WHEN I SAY DON'T HURT THEM, AND THE PRESS WILL SAY, TRUMP IS GETTING SOFT. WHEN I SAY GET HIM OUT, THEN THEY GO, IT WAS TERRIBLE THE WAY HE TALKED. SO I HAVE A MIDDLE GROUND. I SAY GET HIM OUT, AND IF IT WAS TOO TOUGH I SAY, DON'T HURT HIM. DON'T HURT THEM. DON'T HURT THEM. THIS WAY I DON'T GET CRITICIZED BY THE PRESS. MY FATHER HAD A GREAT WAY AND HE WAS A GOOD NEGOTIATOR. HE LOANED ME A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY WHEN I STARTED. 1979, 1980. AND I BUILT IT IN A GREAT FORTUNE. HE USED TO SAY, SON, TAKE THE LUMPS OUT. YOU ARE TOO TOUGH, YOU MAKE TOO MANY ENEMIES. ME WITH ENEMIES? DIDN'T HE DO A GREAT JOB WITH ME? LOOK AT ROMNEY, THE GUY CAN'T EVEN BREATHE. HE DID ONE OF THE WORST JOBS IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS, HE SHOULD HAVE WON HIS ELECTION. IF HE DEVOTED THE ENERGY AND TIME TO WINNING HIS ELECTION AGAINST OBAMA FOUR YEARS AGO, WE WOULDN'T BE WASTING TIME HERE TODAY. THIS GUY WAS A DISASTER. OK? YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS HATE SECOND-GUESSERS. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT SECOND-GUESSERS. AND I SAID THIS, ROMNEY CAME TO SEE ME AND HE BEGGED ME FOR MY SUPPORT. AND WHAT DID I DO? I SAID, DROP TO YOUR KNEES. DROP TO YOUR KNEES. BUT IF I DID, HE WOULD HAVE. I'M TELLING YOU. STEVE FORBES IS HIS FRIEND. THEY SAY I MADE 400 MILLION. AND NOW I KNOW WHY, IT IS OVER 10 MILLION, BUT NOW I KNOW WHY. HE IS MEETING WITH ROMNEY OVER DEALS. I AM TELLING YOU, WE HAVE SOMETHING GOING. THIS THING WE HAVE IS SO SPECIAL. THEY ARE RAILING AGAINST US, THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN -- THE ESTABLISHMENT IS A DISASTER. THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THE ONLY REASON I MENTION THIS IS THE FACT WE NEED THIS TIME TO GET RID OF OUR $19 TRILLION IN DEBT, TO GET RID OF OUR TREMENDOUS DEFICIT WITH EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY WE DO BUSINESS WITH. WHY SHOULD WE BE PROTECTING SAUDI ARABIA FOR PRACTICALLY NOTHING? THEY WOULD NOT EXIST IF IT WASN'T FOR US. WHY SHOULD WE -- EVERY TIME I ORDERED THOUSANDS OF TELEVISION SETS, THOUSANDS, I ORDERED THEM FROM SOUTH KOREA. GET THEM OUT! GET THEM OUT! SEE, THESE ARE BAD PEOPLE. YOU KNOW THE FUNNY THING? WE ALL COME, WE ALL WANT STRONG SECURITY, WE WON A STRONG MILITARY, WE WANT BORDERS, WE WANT TO EDUCATION, WE WANT GOOD HEALTH CARE. I TELL YOU, WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE SO FAST. WE WANT TO HAVE A GOOD LIFE FOR OUR FAMILIES AND OURSELVES, AND WE ALL WANT THAT WHETHER YOU ARE DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. AND THESE PEOPLE, WHAT IS GOING ON? IT IS REALLY RIDICULOUS. IT IS REALLY RIDICULOUS. IT IS REALLY RIDICULOUS. SO, LET'S GO BACK TO MY FATHER. RIGHT? SO MY FATHER WOULD ALWAYS SAY, TAKE THE LUMPS OUT. AND HE WOULD ALWAYS GO LIKE THIS , SON, TAKE THE LUMPS OUT. I WILL BE THE NEGOTIATOR. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE JOHN KERRY DO IT,  WHAT A DISASTER JOHN KERRY WAS. HERE IS WHAT WE DO, WE TAKE THE LUMPS OUT. BEFORE MY FATHER GAVE ME THIS LESSON, I WOULD HAVE SAID, ""I WANT THOSE PRISONERS BACK NOW."" IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN A LONG TIME, PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT. NOW WE SAY THE PRISONERS ARE WITH YOU. YOU DON'T WANT THEM, WE WANT THEM. GOING TO MAKE FOR A BETTER NEGOTIATION. THE PERSIANS ARE GREAT NEGOTIATORS. THEY WILL CALL YOU WITHIN 20 HOURS AND SAY VERY NICELY, CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE YOUR PRISONERS. NOW WE HAVE OUR PRISONERS BACK. THIS WAS FOUR YEARS AGO BEFORE WE START. I WOULD HAVE SAID, I WOULD HAVE WALKED IN, I WOULD HAVE SAID, ""WE'RE NOT GIVING YOU THE $150 BILLION. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?"" ""WE'RE NOT GIVING YOU THE $150 BILLION."" I WENT TO THE WHARTON SCHOOL OF FINANCE. MY FATHER IS STILL A BETTER TEACHER. THEY WERE GREAT, BUT HE IS THE BEST. NOW I GO IN DIFFERENTLY. NOW WE SAY WE HAVE NO MONEY, WE HAVE $19 TRILLION, THE HORRIBLE OMNIBUS DEAL WE SIGNED. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT DEAL? IT IS GOING TO BRING US UP TO $20 TRILLION. WE DON'T HAVE $150 BILLION. WE GOT OUR PRISONERS BACK FOUR YEARS AGO AND NOW WE ARE GIVING THEM $150 BILLION. THAT IS NOT 80% SURE, 95%, 100%, WE GET THE PRISONERS BACK AND WE GET THE MONEY, WE ARE NEVER GOING TO GIVE THEM THE MONEY. I FEEL SO BADLY WE GIVE THEM $150 BILLION. IF I DO WIN, WE DON'T GET THAT MONEY BACK, BUT I WILL FIND A WAY TO GET THAT MONEY BACK. I WILL FIND OUT A WAY. I WILL FIND IT. SO THE NEW THING IS THIS. THE NEW THING IS, HOW DO WE STOP TRUMP? EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO STOP TRUMP. GET OUT OF HERE. OUT!    YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A DIVIDED COUNTRY, FOLKS. WE HAVE A TERRIBLE PRESIDENT, WHO HAPPENS TO BE AFRICAN-AMERI CAN. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A GREATER DIVISION. THE HATRED. THE ANIMOSITY. I WILL BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. I WILL BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER, YOU WATCH. WE ARE GOING TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR JOBS BACK FROM CHINA AND ALL OF THESE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN OUR JOBS. AND MEXICO. AND WE ARE GOING TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER, FOLKS. WE ARE GOING TO BRING THEM TOGETHER. [INDISCERNIBLE  OK. IT IS SORT OF EXCITING, ISN'T IT? SORT OF EXCITING. IN ALL FAIRNESS. ALL RIGHT, LOOK. WE ARE GOING TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. WE ARE GOING TO BRING JOBS BACK, WE'RE GOING TO BRING A LOT OF THINGS AND UNIFY THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS TERRIBLY DIVIDED. IN SO MANY WAYS OUR COUNTRY IS DIVIDED. SO WE WANT TO BE --   YOU HAVE TO SAY IT IS EXCITING, THOUGH, RIGHT?   THIS IS NOT YOUR NORMAL, LOW-KEY RALLY THAT NOBODY CARES ABOUT. LOOK AT ALL THOSE CAMERAS BACK THERE. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY CAMERAS YOU HAVE FOR OTHER PEOPLE? LIKE MAYBE NONE. LOOK AT ALL OF THAT. AND I LOVE THE WAY THEY CAN TWIST AND TURN TO GET INTO THOSE LITTLE CORNERS. WHERE THE PROTESTERS ARE. BECAUSE FOR US, WHEN I TELL THEM, PLEASE TURN YOUR CAMERA AND SHOW THIS MASSIVE CROWD. THEY WOULD NEVER DO IT. THEY WOULD NEVER DO IT. GO AHEAD, TURN THE CAMERAS, FOLKS. TURN THE CAMERAS. SEE THAT, THEY DON'T EVEN MOVE, THEY DON'T EVEN MOVE. HONESTLY, THEY ARE DISGUSTING. WE HAD A THING, NOT SO LONG AGO. NEAR MASSACHUSETTS. I WILL SAY I WILL SAY, TOM BRADY LOVES ME. IF TOM BRADY LOVES YOU AND YOU DON'T WIN MASSACHUSETTS BY A LANDSLIDE, YOU'RE NOT DOING A GOOD JOB. I LOVE TOM BRADY. WE HAD SOMETHING WHERE WE HAD 12,000 PEOPLE. BERNIE SANDERS HAD 3000 PEOPLE AT A DIFFERENT SITE. THE NEXT DAY THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW BIG THE CROWDS WERE FOR BERNIE SANDERS. I SAID THAT IS NOT FAIR, THAT IS REALLY UNFAIR. ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU READY? CAN THE PROTESTERS STOPPED FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS THAT WE CAN TALK YOUR? JUST A COUPLE OF SECONDS? GIVE US FIVE MINUTES AND THEN YOU CAN PROTEST AGAIN. BECAUSE I AM SO PROUD OF SELLING OUT THIS PLACE. THIS IS CRAZY. BY THE WAY, WE HAVE TO SAY THIS. WE REALLY SOLID OUT TWICE. BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO WE HAD TO TURN AWAY AS MORE THAN WE SOLD. SO NOW, THE MOVE BY GUYS LIKE CHOKER MITT. USUALLY IF SOMEONE IS A CHOKER, IT NEVER CHANGES. RIGHT? IF YOU LOOK AT SECRETARY KERRY, HE CHOKED ON THE IRAN DEAL. HE CHOKED. HE SHOULD HAVE LEFT THAT ROOM A COUPLE OF TIMES, WALKED AWAY, DOUBLED UP THE SANCTIONS AND MADE A BETTER DEAL. BUT HE DID NOT DO THAT. HE WAS AFRAID TO LEAVE THE ROOM. HE WAS A CHOKER. THAT WE DON'T WANT CHOKERS. WE DON'T WANT CHOKERS. WHEN I SEE WHAT CHRIS CHRISTIE DID TO YOUR NO-SHOW SENATOR AT THE DEBATE BEFORE LAST, WHEN CHRIS GRILLED HIM -- AND CHRIS ENDORSED ME, WHICH I LOVE.   BUT CHRIS CHRISTIE, I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT, LITTLE MARCO IS RIGHT NEXT TO ME AND CHRIS CHRISTIE IS GOING HIM LIKE A GOOD PROSECUTOR. AND CHRIS IS GRILLING AND GRILLING HIM. OH, WE HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE. WHAT IS IT? WE NEED A DOCTOR. DO WE HAVE A DOCTOR? A WOMAN FAINTED. A WOMAN FAINTED. WE LOVE PEOPLE THAT FAINT. I THINK IT IS ONLY FAINT. ARE YOU OK, DARLING? TAKE YOUR TIME. TAKE YOUR TIME.    THOSE ARE THE  PEOPLE WE LOVE. SHE'S BEEN HERE FOR SEVEN HOURS. GET BETTER.  WE'LL SEND YOU FLOWERS. YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE. WE LOVE YOU. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE LOVE, RIGHT? THOSE ARE GREAT PEOPLE.  THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY, WILL TELL YOU THAT. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF DECISIONS TO BE MADE. SO NOW I HEAR THE NEW WAY OF   STOPPING TRUMP -- OH, THAT'S --  YOU KNOW WHAT, THOSE FLOWERS ARE FOR ME?  HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO, RUN UP AND CATCH THAT WOMAN AND  GIVE THOSE FLOWERS TO THAT WOMAN. I LOVE THAT. HOW YOU DOING, MAN? THAT'S NICE. THAT'S NICE. SO IN THE TIMES TODAY AND IN   MANY OTHER NEWSPAPERS THEY'RE SORT OF STARTING TO GIVE UP ABOUT TRUMP. IF WE WIN FLORIDA, BELIEVE ME,   IT'S OVER. IF WE WIN --     AND WE'RE GOING WIN AND YOU'RE   GOING TO HAVE A GREAT PRESIDENT  AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A   GREAT, GREAT COUNTRY AND YOU'RE  GOING TO FEEL SO PROUD OF YOUR   COUNTRY AGAIN. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE   EMBARRASSED WITH SERGEANT BERDALL. WE GET BERDALL -- WE GET A DIRTY ROTTEN TRADER, FOUR PEOPLE, FIVE PEOPLE, SIX PEOPLE PROBABLY DIED TRYING TO FIND THEM. SO WE GET BERDALL AND THEY GET   FIVE OF THE BIGGEST KILLERS THAT THEY'VE BEEN WANTING FOR YEARS. THAT'S NO TRADE, FOLKS. WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE DEALS  LIKE THAT, FOLKS. WE DON'T MAKE DEALS LIKE THAT. AS FAR AS THE WATERBOARDING IS   CONCERNED, WE HAVE TO STAY WITHIN THE LAWS. WE HAVE TO STAY WITHIN THE LAWS. HEY, WHO HERE THINKS THAT'S SYS WHO CHOPS OFF HEADS, WHO DROUNS PEOPLE IN A CAGE, WHO HERE THINKS THAT'S SYS STAYS WITHIN   THE LAWS, RIGHT? WE'RE LIKE A BUNCH OF BABIES.  BUT WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITHIN   THE LAWS. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE  LAWS BROADENED BECAUSE WE'RE   PLAYING WITH TWO SETS OF RULES, THEIR RULES AND OUR RULES. AND THOSE LAWS ARE GOING TO BE BROADENED. IT'S EMBARRASSING TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING. WE FIGHT -- OH, WATERBOARDING IS SO BAD.  IT'S SO BAD. IT'S SO HORRIBLE.  WATERBOARDING IS SUCH A TERRIBLE THING. WE'RE GOING INCREASE IT. THINK ABOUT IT.  WATERBOARDING IS SUCH A TERRIBLE THING. NOW YOU HAVE ISIS CELEBRATING THE FACT THAT THEY CUT OFF THE   HEADS OF 30 CHRISTIANS, RIGHT? YOU THINK THEY OBEY THE LAWS?  THE LAWS? I TOLD THIS STORY AND SOME PEOPLE SAID IT WASN'T  NECESSARILY TRUE.  IT'S A ROUGH STORY.  SHOULD I TELL IT OR NOT? ALREADY. REMEMBER THEY ASKED ME TO TELL   IT. SO IT'S NOT MY FAULT.  BUT IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN WE WERE STRONG AND RESPECTED, WE HAD A GENERAL NAMED GENERAL PERSHING. HEY, GENERAL PATTON, HOW LONG DO YOU THINK ISIS WOULD LAST WITH   THE GREAT GEORGE PATTON OR GENERAL MACARTHUR? THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH TERRORISM, RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM, OK? THEY HAD A BIG, BIG PROBLEM. TREMENDOUS ATROCITIES WERE BEING COMMITTED. AND GENERAL PER SHING AND HIS  GROUP WERE SENT OUT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. AND THEY CAUGHT 50 TERRORISTS AND THEY TOOK THOSE TERRORISTS AND THEY STOOD THEM UP ALL 50  AND THEY TOOK THE BULLETS AND THEY CUT OPEN TWO BIGS AND THEY  DROGGED THE BULLETS INTO THE   PIGS AND THEY TOOK THE PIG'S   BLOOD. THEY TOOK THE BULLETS. THEY SHOT 49 OF THE BULLETS LOADED UP WITH PIG FAT AND PIG   BLOOD WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING THAT -- NOT NICE, NOT  POLITICALLY CORRECT. I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD ALLOW   THAT TODAY, DO YOU AGREE?  THEY SHOT 49 OF THE 50 TERRORISTS.  AND THE FINAL TERRORIST JUST   BEFORE HE WAS GOING TO BE SHOT,  THEY WENT UP TO HIM. THEY SAID, HERE, TAKE THIS BULLET.  THIS BULLET WAS MEANT TO YOU AND HE HARDLY WANTED TO TOUCH IT.  TAKE THIS BULLET.  IT WAS MEANT FOR YOU. GO BACK AND TELL YOUR PEOPLE, THERE WILL BE NO MORE TERRORISM. FOR 28 YEARS THERE WAS NO MORE   TERRORISM. FOR 28 YEARS THERE WAS NO MORE TERRORISM. LOOK IT UP IN THE PHILIPPINES. GENERAL PERSHING, 28 YEARS THERE WAS NO MORE TERRORISM. WE CAN BE BABIES.  WE CAN BE FOOLISH. WE HAVE TO BE STRONG.  WE HAVE TO BE SMART. WHEN PARIS HAPPENED -- THAT  ATTACK IN PARIS WHERE THE PRESS  WAS CALLING THE LEADERS THE  MASTERMIND. AND THE KIDS WE'RE LOSING OUR  KIDS BECAUSE THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR ISIS.  HE'S NOT A MAER MIND.  I CALL HIM GUY WITH THE DIRTY  HAT. REMEMBER THE WHITE HAT? I CALL HIM THE HAT.  SO THEY SENT PEOPLE IN BECAUSE PARIS, BY THE WAY HAS THE  TOUGHEST GUNS LAWS IN THE WORLD. FRANCE HAS THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE WORLD.  ONLY THE BAD GUYS HAVE THE GUNS. NOW IF A FEW OF YOU LIKE THAT  GUY WITH HIS HAND UP, A FEW OF   YOU HAD GUNS WRAPPED AROUND YOUR HIPS AND YOU WERE IN THAT ROOM AND YOU HAD BULL WILLS GOING IN  THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, I  GUARANTEE THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN 130 PEOPLE KILLED. MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE HOP RIGHT NOW. SO WE HAVE TO TOTALLY PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT, FOLKS. WE HAVE TO DO IT.  WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR SECOND EAM. -- EAM.  IN CALIFORNIA, WHEN YOU HAD THE RADICALIZED WOMAN COME OVER AND RADICALIZE PROBABLY THE YOUNG MAN -- NOW THEY'RE RADICALIZED AND THEY GO IN AND THEY KILL THEIR FELLOW WORKERS. WORKERS THAT GAVE THEM BABY SHOWERS AND PARTIES. WORKERS THAT THEY KNEW AND WORKERS FROM WHAT I HEAR THEY LIKED. THEY WENT IN AND KILLED 14 OF THEM.  OTHERS IN THE HOSPITAL WILL NEVER EVER BE THE SAME. THEY WANTED IN, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. THE FIVE MILITARY PEOPLE THAT WERE KILLED IN A GUN-FREE ZONE, THINK OF IT -- IN A GUN-FREE   ZONE IN A MILITARY BASE. WHY DO WE HAVE GUN-FREE ZONES. THAT MEANS YOU WOULD NEVER LET YOUR SOLDIERS HAVE GUNS. AND ALL THESE GUYS THAT COMPLAIN ABOUT GUNS LIKE MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, USED TO BE A FRIEND   OF MINE, BY THE WAY. NO, NO -- LIKE MANY OF THEM,   THEY'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT GUNS.  SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO -- TELL THEM IMMEDIATELY TO TAKE THE   GUNS AWAY FROM THEIR BODYGUARDS RIGHT NOW. TAKE THE GUNS AWAY FROM THEIR  BODYGUARDS. AND LET'S SEE HOW THEY FEEL WALKING AROUND CERTAIN PLACES,   OK?  LET'S SEE IF THEY'RE HAPPY.  I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO   BE TOO HAPPY. SO WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT OUR  SECOND AMENDMENT ME MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE UP HERE, WE'RE  GOING TO PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT.  WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF COMMON CORE. WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR EDUCATION LOCALLY WITH LOVE, UNLIKE JEB BUSH HE USED TO SAY   THAT PEOPLE COME IN AS AN ACK OF LOVE.  OH, THERE'S NO ACT OF LOVE. SO WE'RE GOING TO GET RID -- WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF A LOT  OF THINGS. WE'RE GETTING RID OF OBAMACARE. WE'RE PLAYING IT, OK?  WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF COMMON CORE. IN 30 COUNTRIES IN EDUCATION THE UNITED STATES IS RATED NUMBER  30. YOU HAVE DENMARK, SWEDEN, NORWAY, CHIND OTHERS. THEY'RE THE BEST.  AND YET IN TERMS OF COST PER   PUPIL, WE'RE NUMBER ONE BY FAR. NUMBER TWO DOESN'T EVEN EXIST  IT'S SO FAR DOWN.  HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THE  CAMPAIGN.  SO WHEN NUMBER ONE IS CAUGHT AND YOU HAVE BACK -- THIRD-WORLD NATIONS WITH BETTER EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS THAN OUR COUNTRY THAT WE LOVE.  WE CAN'T HAVE -- YOU KNOW, WE TALK ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM. PEOPLE CAN'T HAVE THE AMERICAN   DREAM UNLESS THEY GET EDUCATED.  SO REMEMBER, THE MOST EXPENSIVE, THE AT LEAST FOR THE BUCK,   RIGHT? NOW, MY CAMPAIGN LET'S TALK. I'VE SPENT THELES AMOUNT OF  MONEY AND I'M NUMBER ONE BY A LOT. I'M KILLING EVERYBODY. WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE? WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE.  >> IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WHICH WAS A  GREAT STAY. WE'RE GOING STOP HEROI, N FROM   COMING.  THAT'S ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. BUT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THEY HAVE   AN UNBELIEVABLE THING. BUT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, I SPENT $2 MILLION AND I WAS NUMBER ONE IN THE LANDSLIDE. DO WE AGREE? EVEN THOSE PEOPLE WOULD SAY I  DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. I WAS NUMBER ONE AND I SPENT   VERY LITTLE. SOMEBODY ELSE SPENT $48 MILLION  --   SO I SPENT IN NEW  HAMPSHIRE VERY, VERY LITTLE MONEY AND SOMEBODY SPENT $48   MILLION AND WENT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PACK. WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO BE WITH ME  AND LET'S SPEND THE BEST.  I'M BUILDING A HOTEL NOW ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE AND WASHINGTON.  I DO IT BECAUSE I DO IT. THAT'S WHAT I DO. BUT I'VE GOING TO FROM GENERAL SERVICES, G.S.A., VERY   PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE BY THE WAY   IF I DIDN'T GET IT I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE SAYING THAT BUT THAT'S OK.  >> ONE OF THE MOST HEAVILY BID   -- CONTESTED IN THE HISTORY OF THE G.S.A. YOU KNOW, IT'S ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE RIGHT BETWEEN THE WHITE   HOUSE AND THE CAPITAL BUILDING. THE MOST INCREDIBLE BUILDINGS. THEY GAVE IT TO TRUMP FOR TWO REASONS. I HAVE THE BEST STATEMENT YOU'VE EVER SEEN. THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT'S  DONE.  >> AND THAT LOVE THE PROJECT. WE'LL EMPLOY A LOT OF PEOPLE.  AND THEY MADE THE DECISION AND   THEY BROLED IT DOWN. GREAT COMPANIES. BUT YOU HEARD OF EVERY ONE OF  THEM.  >> THEY CHOICE IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THAT. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT? WHICH TELLS YOU TWO THINGS.  NUMBER ONE I HAVE A GREAT  STATEMENT AND A GREAT CONCEPT. IT WILL BE ONE OF THE GREAT  HOTELS OF THE WORLD. SO WE START AT CONSTRUCTION. WE'RE TWO YEARS OF AHEAD OF CONVERSATION. WE'RE OPENING UP IN SEPTEMBER BEFORE THE ELECTION. ISN'T THAT GREAT? SO LISTEN TO THIS. SO WE'RE UNDER BUDGET AND TWO  YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. WOULDN'T WE LOVE TO HAVE THE   COUNTRY THAT COULD DO THAT? YOU EVER SEE THESE. YOU EVER SEE THESE PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE WHETHER THERE WAS 1,000% MANY TIMES -- THAT DOESN'T   HAPPEN WITH ME.  YOU KNOW, WE HAVE CONTRACTORS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT BID ON THESE   GOVERNMENT JOBS . THEY ARE SO RICH, YOU HAVE NO  IDEA. THEY ARE SO RICH, THEY MAKE SO MUCH MONEY THEY TAKE THE MONEY   FROM GOVERNMENT. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITH  ME.  LY STAR A NEW SET OF PROCEDURES  WHERE THAT STUFF DOESN'T HAPPEN, FOLKS. IT WON'T HAPPEN. IF I DON'T WIN, I'M LIVING ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE ANYWAY.  ALL RIGHT?  SO NOW -- TO NOW THE NEW GROUP IS TRYING TO STOP TRYING AND THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF  PEOPLE HAPPY.  >> AND THEY ACTUALLY MENTIONED THAT IF THAT HAPPENS THAT IT   WOULD ALMOST BE A REVOLUTION, I  MEAN, IT WOULD BE. BECAUSE THE LAST THING THAT YOU PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TAKE IS HAVING A LIGHT WEIGHT LIKE A MARCO RUBIO. HAVING A GUY LIKE THIS OR LYING TED CRUZ OR SOME POLL TIGS. WE CAN'T HAVE IT ANYMORE. I REALLY -- I'M TALKING ABOUT  STEERS, SERIOUS, SERIOUS PROBLEMS. SO NOW, WHAT THEY'RE DOING, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STOP.  YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT TO VOTE, FOLKS. GOT TO.   NOW REMEMBER THIS -- IT'S TUESDAY THE 15TH. SO IT'S NOT THIS TUESDAY. IT'S THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY. IT'S TUESDAY THE 15TH. IF YOU DON'T FEEL GOOD AND FETCH YOU CAN'T WALK, HAVE SOMEBODY  LIFT YOU UP. I'LL PAY FOR IT. I'LL GET AN AMBULANCE. BUT LISTEN.  HERE'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.  SO IT'S NOT TUESDAY. IT'S THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY. IF WE WIN FLORIDA, IT'S OVER. IF WE WIN FLEE AND OHIO IT'S   REALLY OVER, OK? AND I THINK WE HAVE A GOOD   CHANCE.  NOW, IN FLORIDA, YOU CAN EARLY   VOTE. RIGHT? YOU CAN GO OUT AND YOU CAN VOTE  EARLY. SO GO AND DO IT. GO VOTE. YOU'VE GOT -- OK. WATHE. LET'S DO A PLEDGE. WHO LIKES TO BE IN THIS ROOM?    OK. I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE. CAN I HAVE A PLEDGE OR A SWEARING, RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND. I DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR THAT I I NO  MATTER HOW I FEEL, NO MATTER   WHAT THE CONDITIONS IF THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES OR WHATEVER. THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH. WE'LL VOTE ON OR BEFORE THE 12TH FOR DONALD J. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT! THANK YOU. NOW I KNOW.  DON'T FORGET. YOU SWORE. BAD THINGS HAPPEN IF YOU LIVE UP IN.  YOU KNOW, THEY USED TO CALL IT THE SILENT MAJORITY AND I WAS SORT OF USING THAT TAG AND SOME  PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE THAT NAME   BECAUSE FOR WHATEVER REASON IT   THOUGHT OF BAD CONNOTATIONS, OK? WE'RE NOT THE SILENT MAJORITY. WE'RE THE REALLY NOISY MAJORITY, RIGHT? SO NOW WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THE ACCOMPLISHMENT.  AND THEY HAD THE WRONG MESS AND LOST WHOREABLY AND MADE A  FULL OUT OF THEMSELVES.  >> THEIR MESSAGES THAT COULD BE GOOD.  THEIR MESSAGES THAT COULD BE   GOOD. BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU, SO NOW WHAT THEY'RE THINKING OFFER DOING BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK THEY CAN STOP US, ALL RIGHT? MAYBE THEY CAN. HEY, LOOK, MY LIFE IS OK.  I MEAN, A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WHY  ARE YOU DOING THIS, YOU HAVE   SUCH A GREAT LIE. YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL FAMILY. I'M DOING IT BECAUSE THIS COUNTRY WAS SO GREAT TO BE. IT'S PAYBACK TIME, FOLKS.  IT'S PAYBACK. SO NOW WHAT THESE ABSOLUTE NAIVE PEOPLE, WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.  THEY WANT TO START A THIRD PARTY. REMEMBER, I DID THE PLEDGE THAT DIDN'T DO THAT.  THANK YOU. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. GET HIM OUT. GET HIM OUT OF HERE. SO I DO A PLEDGE BUT THEY DON'T  HONOR ANYTHING. THEY WANT TO START A THIRD   PARTY. AND THEY WANT TO PUT A COUPLE OF CLOWNS IN THERE THAT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO BEAT HILLARY.  THIS WOMAN, JUST THINK IT. WE LOST THE GREAT MY SISTER IS A HIGH JUDGE.  AND SHE MEET JUSTICE SKILL YEAH. SHE SAID HE WAS A VAN. WE LOST. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN LIFE,  NOBODY EVERY TALKED ABOUT HIM. IT WASN'T GOING TO BE HIM. YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT THOUGHT   THEY WERE GOING TO BE BELIEVING.  >> AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HEAFS   GREAT JOB, A BRILLIANT JUDGE HAD SO MANY QUALITIES AND A  BRILLIANT JUDGE. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO REPLACE WITH AS CLOSE TO HIM AS WE CAN   GET. I GAVE SOME NAMES OF   CONSERVATIVE JUDGES.  >> THIS IS WHERE IT DOESN'T WORK FOR THEM.  IT'S CALLED THE SUPREME COURT. LET'S SAY THEY PICKED A CUP OF REPUBLICANS BUT THEY'LL PUT IN A CUP OF REPUBLICANS. AND THESE REBOUNDS WILL TAKE OFF 3% OF THE VOTE.  AND NOW HILLARY GOES IN. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REPLACE PROBABLY OVER THE NEXT FOUR-TERM INCLUDING JUDGE SCALIA. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF IF THAT HAPPENS?  >> I DON'T KNOW IF THEE THEY'VE GOT TO PUT ON GOOD CONSERVATIVE BRILLYANTS JUDGES, RIGHT? IF A HILLARY GETS IN OR WHOEVER  -- I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE COULD CAN RUN. BUT LET'S ASSUME SHE'LL RUN. DON'T FORGET YOU HAVE A STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. LET'S ASSUME THAT SHE RUNS AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE WOULD DO WITH THE SUPREME COURT. THAT SHE'LL DO OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS INCLUDING ANT ALL THIS WORK NOT TO APPOINT THE JUDGE. THAT WOULD GO TO HILLARY IF SHE WINS. WHEN THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO PLAY GAMES -- LOOK THIS  ESTABLISHMENT GROUP HEADED BY  MITT ROMNEY WHO'S NOT A SMARTMAN MAN, I'M TELLING YOU. AND STEVE FORINGS, I FINALLY FOUND OUT WHY THEY NEVER GAVE ME THE RIGHT NUMBER IN SPOTS  MAGAZINE. THEIR BUT I DON'T CARE.  ER I DON'T CARE. REMEMBER THIS, IF THEY DO THAT,  FOLKS, NUMBER ONE THEY'RE DOING  IT TO YOU.  >> THEY'RE DOING IT TO YOU.  THEY'RE DOING IT TO THE MOVEMENT.  TAKE A LOOK AT TIME MAGAZINE FOUR WEEKS AGO, THE FOAST INCREDIBLE STORY I'VE EVER HAD.  THAT THE PEOPLE IN WLOVE EACH  OTHER. WE HAVE A GREAT COUNTRY. WE HAVE A COUNTRY WHERE APPLE IS GOING TO START MAKING THEIR  IPHONES LIKE THAT IN OUR   COUNTRY. BELIEVE ME WHEN I GET FINISHED. BELIEVE ME.  >> WE HAVE A GREAT COUNTRY BUT WE HAVE LEADERSHIP THAT'S ALMOST AS NONEXISTENT.  WE HAVE INCOMPETENT LEADERS. WHEN HA HAPPENS. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU ONE  CARRIER -- I BOUGHT A LOT OF CARRIER CAFE. THEY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY'RE  MOVING TO NEW MEXICO, NORTH CAROLINA.  >> SOMEBODY HAD THE CELL PHONE GOING TAKING THE PICTURES. AND 1400 JOBS ARE GONE. LIKE MAGIC.  PROBABLY A MID LEVEL GUY.  I'M SORRY BUT WE'RE MOVING TO  FECKS CO.  AND I SAID THAT'S TERRIBLE. 40-BUILDING. I LOVE MEXICO. I HAVE THOUSANDS OF HISPANICS  THAT WORK FOR ME. I LOVE THE HISPANICS. I LOVE YOU.  I LOVE YOU.  I LOVE YOU.  BUT I HAVE THOUSANDS OF  HISPANICS THAT WORK FOR ME. AND THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE.  REMEMBER, IN NEVADA I WON THE HISPANICS.  >> WE HAVE THESE GAMES THAT THEY CALL THEM THE ELITE. HALF OF THEM CAN'T TYPE THEIR SHOES. AND THEY SAY DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A FREE TRADER. BUT IT HAS TO BE SMART. WE CAN'T HAVE TRADE WHILE  BALANCES LIKE $588 MEXICO. HERE'S WHAT WE DO. WEAPON TELL THE CAR YOUR -- AND  I WANT TO DO IT MYSELF BUT THEY'RE ALL GOING SAY IT'S NOT PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. MAYBE I'LL DO IT AGAIN ANYWAY. LET THEM STAY THAT.  BUT I'LL GET CARL ICAHN OR PHIL  RUSSMAN. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENINGS. WE CALL UP CARRIER AND WE SAY  I'D LIKE TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON  YOUR MOVE TO MEXICO. CONGRATULATIONS, I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL. 1400 PEOPLE IN MEXICO AND MANY MORE. AND OTHER DIVISIONS THERE. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. SO HERE'S WHAT I TELL THEM. I SAID CONGRATULATIONS. IER HOPE YOU EMPLOY A LOT OF   PEOPLE FROM MEXICO. HERE'S THE STORY, FOLKS. EVERY AIR-CONDITIONING UNIT THAT YOU MAKE THAT'S PUT ACROSS THE   BORDER WHICH WILL BE A CROSS BORDER. THEY'RE NOT COMING UNLESS THEY   HAVE OUR PERMISSION. EVERY SINGLE AIR-CONDITIONING UNITE THAT COME IN AND IMPOSE A 35% ZACK ON THAT YEARS.  [CHEERS AND  NOW, IF   LITTLE LION IS PRESIDENT OR IF   LION TEST IS PRESIDENT. THEY'RE GOING TO BE CALLED BY THEIR LOBBYIST. THEY'RE GOING TO BE CALLED BY THE SPECIAL INTEREST. THEY'RE GOING TO BE CALLED BY  DONORS AND STOCKHOLDERS THAT   GAVE THEM MINUTE.  I'M PUTTING UP MY OWN MONEY. I DON'T THINK I GET ANY CREDIT.  I DON'T THINK ANYONE SELLS OH,   IN FLORIDA BECAUSE A GOOD REASON TO VOTE FOR ME.  REMEMBER WHAT I SAID.  ALL OF THESE GUYS ARE BOUGHT AND PAID FOR, FOLKS. ALL RIGHT. SO THEY KNOW IT'S BAD. THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO TO WARDEN OR HIGH SCHOOL.  SO HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO  HAPPEN. IF RUBIO GETS A CALL OR IF TELL  GETS A CAN. THEY'RE GOING TO SAY YOU CAN'T   DO THAT. THEY CONTRIBUTED 50 MILLION TO YOUR CAMPAIGN. WE'RE WE'RE DONING JUST WANT TO DO THAT. I UNDERSTAND.","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Rally in Orlando, Florida"

DONALD J. TRUMP.  MR. TRUMP: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. I GREATLY APPRECIATE IT. NICE TO HAVE YOU ALL A TRUMP INTERNATIONAL. IT'S BEEN A GREAT CLUB AND A GREAT SUCCESS, AND WE APPRECIATE IT. IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING NIGHT. I'VE BEEN IN COMPETITIONS ALL OF MY LIFE. THERE IS NOTHING SO EXCITING AS THIS STUFF. NOTHING.  WINNING DEALS OR WINNING CLUB CHAMPIONSHIPS -- THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THIS. IT IS REALLY EXCITING STUFF AND VERY IMPORTANT. I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA, THE PEOPLE OF KENTUCKY. IT HAS BEEN JUST AN AMAZING RELATIONSHIP. AMAZING RELATIONSHIP. RAND PAUL, YOUR SENATOR IN KENTUCKY, FOUGHT VERY HARD, FIGHTING US EVERY INCH OF THE WAY, AND WE WON, AND WE WON BY QUITE A FEW VOTES. THANK YOU TO LOUISIANA, AND THANK YOU TO KENTUCKY. I WANT TO THANK THE FOLKS FROM MAINE AND FROM KANSAS. WE CAME IN SECOND, AND WE DID SPEND VERY MUCH TIME. TWO HOURS IN ONE PLACE, TWO AND A HALF HOURS IN THE OTHER, AND WE CAME IN A STRONG SECOND. I WANT TO THANK THOSE FOLKS. I WANT TO CONGRATULATE TED ON MAINE AND KANSAS.HE SHOULD DO WELL IN MAINE BECAUSE IT'S CLOSE TO CANADA. LET'S FACE IT.   I THINK MARCO RUBIO HAD A VERY, VERY BAD NIGHT, AND PERSONALLY, I WOULD CALL FOR HIM TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE. I THINK IT'S TIME NOW THAT HE DROP OUT OF THE RACE. I REALLY THINK SO.  I THINK IT'S PROBABLY TIME. I DON'T THINK TONIGHT HE CAN GET UP AND RANT AND RAVE. HE COMES IN THIRD. EVERY TIME HE COMES IN THIRD OR FOURTH -- YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO WIN. I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE ON TED ONE ON ONE.THAT WOULD BE SO MUCH FUN. TED CAN'T WIN NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, PENNSYLVANIA, CALIFORNIA. I WANT TED ONE-ON-ONE, OK? I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS WE DID SO WELL TONIGHT AND SO STRONG IS THE REALLY HAD A GOOD DEBATE. I THINK WE DID VERY WELL. I WAS HIT FROM EVERY SIDE, EVERY ANGLE VERY VICIOUSLY, BUT I THINK WE DID WELL IN THE DEBATE. WE ARE MARCHING ALONG, AND I THINK WE ARE DOING WELL IN FLORIDA. TODAY, I WAS IN ORLANDO. WE HAD A GROUP OF AT LEAST 20,000 PEOPLE. WE HAD TO SEND 10,000 PEOPLE AWAY, AND THE PLACE WAS PACKED. IT WAS AN AMAZING DAY. I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA. IT'S MY SECOND HOME. I JUST WANT TO THANK FLORIDA FOR BEING JUST INCREDIBLE, AND I'M LOOKING AT THE POLL NUMBERS.  EVEN THOUGH I'VE NEVER SEEN ANY HUMAN BEING HIT WITH MORE NEGATIVE COMMERCIALS THAN I'VE BEEN HIT WITH -- I'M TELLING YOU, NO HUMAN BEING SHOULD HAVE $49 SPENT ON NEGATIVE COMMERCIALS, AND DESPITE THAT, WE HAVE A LEAD IN FLORIDA. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO WELL IN OHIO. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO FANTASTICALLY IN OHIO. I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF THAT STATE. THE BIGGEST STORY IN ALL OF POLITICS IS IT WHAT IS HAPPENING TONIGHT AND ON SUPER TUESDAY, BUT THE BIGGEST STORY IS THE TREMENDOUS OUTPOURING OF VOTERS COMING INTO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. YOU ARE SEEING WHAT IS HAPPENING.   MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE COMING IN AND VOTING, AND YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE. THEY ARE DOING COVERS ON ""TIME MAGAZINE"" BECAUSE IT'S A MOVEMENT, AND I'M HONORED TO SAY THAT IF I WERE NOT INVOLVED, THAT WERE NOT BE HAPPENING. I WILL SAY I'M KIDDING THE COUSIN I WANT THEM TO SAY I'M A NICE PERSON. -- BECAUSE I WANT THEM TO SAY I'M A NICE PERSON. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. AS A PARTY, WE SHOULD COME TOGETHER AND STOP THIS FOOLISHNESS. I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE ESTABLISHMENT IS UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING, AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT, ALTHOUGH I USED TO BE PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT. SEVEN MONTHS AGO BEFORE I DECIDED TO RUN, I WAS PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT. THEY SAID, WHAT IS HE DOING? WE WANT PEOPLE WE CAN CONTROL. WE WANT PEOPLE WE CAN GIVE MONEY TO SO THAT IF WE WANT SOMEBODY FOR PHARMACEUTICAL OR UTILITIES OR LUMBER OR OIL AND GAS, WE HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER OUR SENATOR OR CONGRESSMAN. I AM SELF-FUNDING. I'M NOT TAKING THEIR MONEY. I'M GOING TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND THAT'S VERY SIMPLE, SO THEY ARE NOT HAPPY. I WAS THINKING TODAY, BECAUSE I LOVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND I LOVE THE CONSERVATIVES, AND I LOVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE, AND I'VE BEEN A MEMBER FOR A LONG TIME. FOR THE FIRST TIME, I WAS REALLY THINKING ABOUT THIS. WE LOST A GREAT MAN, JUSTICE SCALIA. HE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED, AND YOU CAN ONLY REPLACE HIM WITH SOMEONE TRULY GREAT. HE CAN NEVER BE REPLACED. A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MY SISTER WHO IS A FEDERAL JUDGE ON THE COURT OF APPEALS. HIGHLY RESPECTED. THAT WAS TOTALLY UNEXPECTED. PICTURE SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THEY ARE SAYING, MAYBE WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BEAT TRUMP THE NORMAL WAY, SO WE WILL RUN A THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE, AND MAYBE WE CAN'T WIN ALL THE STATES, BUT WE WILL DO ENOUGH SO DONALD TRUMP CAN'T WIN. WHAT ARE THEY DOING? THEY ARE GOING TO APPOINT A CONSERVATIVE, GREAT JUDGE, SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE THE PEOPLE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY VERY HAPPY, SOMEONE WHO WILL MAKE THE PEOPLE VERY HAPPY. IF THEY RUN A THIRD-PARTY OR AN INDEPENDENT, IF THEY DO THAT, IT WILL MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE, ON THE ASSUMPTION IT'S ME OR ANYBODY, TO WIN. IF THAT MEANS LOSING, THAT MEANS HILLARY CLINTON WHO SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO RUN BECAUSE OF WHAT SHE DID WITH THE E-MAILS -- SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO RUN --  ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY DID THAT, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR A REPUBLICAN TO WIN. OBVIOUSLY, THE INDEPENDENT OR THIRD PARTY COULD NOT WIN, SO THE DEMOCRATS WOULD HAVE AN ABSOLUTELY FREE RUN. PROBABLY, YOU WOULDN'T EVEN CAMPAIGN BECAUSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? -- THAT MEANS THAT AUTOMATICALLY THEY ARE GOING TO APPOINT VERY, VERY, VERY LIBERAL JUDGES. THE NEW PRESIDENT, WHO WOULD BE A DEMOCRAT, WILL POINT THE JUDGE -- A POINT THE JUDGE, -- WILL APPOINT THE JUDGE, SO IT NO LONGER MATTERS. WE COULD SEE THE APPOINTMENT OF 3, 4, OR FIVE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. YOU'VE GOT TO START THINKING ABOUT THAT, FOLKS. ANYBODY WHO DOES A THIRD PARTY, THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO MEAN. IT GUARANTEES -- 100% GUARANTEES THE ELECTION OF THE DEMOCRAT. THAT MEANS THE APPOINTMENT OF SUPREME COURT JUDGES, 3, 4, OR FIVE. THAT'S A TOTAL WIPEOUT FOR CONSERVATIVES AND FOR REPUBLICANS. START THINKING ABOUT THAT. START THINKING ABOUT IT. THIS WAS JUST AN EXCITING TIME. I'M HAVING A LOT OF FUN. I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT TED I WAS WATCHING HIM. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE TWO STATES, TED. HE WAS SAYING THE DONALD TRUMP HAS A CEILING OF 35% TO 40%. CNN CAME OUT WITH OLD -- A POLL TWO DAYS AGO THAT SAYS I HAVE 49% COMPARED TO HIS. 49% -- SOME OF THE POLLS ARE SHOWING OVER 50%. I DON'T EVEN THINK THEY ARE ACCURATE. I HAVE W O-- WON MANY POLLS AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON DIRECTLY , AND I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'S GOING TO BEAT HER, IF SHE IS ALLOWED TO RUN. AND THE ONLY 1 -- REMEMBER THAT. AND I AM THE ONE PERSON, THE ONE PERSON, TRUST ME, THAT SHE DOES NOT WANT TO RUN AGAINST. NOW, WE'VE ONLY HAD ONE LITTLE SKIRMISH HERE THAT WAS FOUR WEEKS AGO. THAT WAS NOT PLEASANT FOR HER AND BILL. BUT I'M THE ONE PERSON --   I'M REALLY ASHAMED OF THE PRESS BECAUSE THEY GOT IT WRONG. THEY DID NOT GIVE ME ANY CREDIT. DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN SHE WAS BEATING BERNIE EASILY? SUDDENLY, FOUR WEEKS AGO, BERNIE WAS DOING GREAT. YOU KNOW WHY? SHE WENT DOWN. AND YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE OF MY SKIRMISH. AND I GET NO CREDIT FOR THAT. PLEASE GIVE ME CREDIT.   SO, I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT RACE. AND AGAIN, I HAVEN'T REALLY DONE ANYTHING WITH HILLARY. WE HAVEN'T STARTED WITH HILLARY EXCEPT FOR THE ONE MOMENT FOR WEEKS AGO -- FOUR WEEKS AGO. I HEARD HILLARY TODAY AND I WATCHED HER STATEMENT TONIGHT AND HER STATEMENT IS ""MAKE AMERICA WHOLE."" THAT'S A TERRIBLE STATEMENT.   MAKE AMERICA HWOL -- WHOLE. I THINK SHE MEANS WE ARE IN A WHOLE. WE ARE IN A DEEP -- IN A HOLE. WE ARE IN A DEEP HOLE, AND WE ARE TRYING TO DIG OUR WAY OUT. MAKE AMERICA WHOLE? NO, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THAT'S WHAT MINE IS. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  OK? SO, AGAIN, THIS HAS BEEN A VERY EXCITING EVENING. AGAIN, I JUST HAVE TO THINK THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA AND OF KENTUCKY -- TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA AND OF KENTUCKY. LAST NIGHT, WE HAD A GROUP OF PEOPLE IN AN AIRPLANE HANGAR. THIS WAS A SERIOUSLY BIG HANG AR FOR VERY, VERY BIG PLANES. THERE WERE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. SAME THING A FEW DAYS AGO IN KENTUCKY. WE HAD A RALLY THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. TODAY'S RALLY IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA -- NOBODY HAS SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. THEY ARE SAYING THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS IN THIS COUNTRY. IT WAS SO REPORTED -- EVEN IN ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"" TODAY, PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. IT'S A MOVEMENT. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY FRIENDS AND MEMBERS, ALL OF MY EVERYTHING. YOU HAVE BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE, SO GREAT. YOU ARE VERY, VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE. THANK YOU. WITH THAT, IF YOU WOULD LIKE, YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT IS AMONG THE MOST DISHONEST PEOPLE EVER CREATED BY GOD. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE -- THE PRESS ARE AMONG THE MOST HONEST PEOPLE EVER CREATED BY GOD. I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS. JOHN.  IF I CAN DO IT, I WOULD DO IT. THANK YOU. IF I CAN DO IT, I WILL DO IT. YES, SIR. GO AHEAD.  I LOVE YOU AS A REPORTER. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? THIS IS THE GREATEST GUY. I CALL HIM LYING TED. HE HOLDS UP THE BIBLE, THEN HE PUTS IT DOWN AND LIES. I NEVER SAW A MAN WHO LIES AS MUCH. WHAT HE DID TO BEN CARSON IS A DISGRACE. AND ACTUALLY, TO ME. HAD HE NOT GOTTEN THOSE IOWA VOTES, I WOULD HAVE WON IOWA. I WOULD HAVE WON EVERYTHING. WHEN HE DID VOTER VIOLATION ON A FORM THAT LOOKS LIKE IT CAME RIGHT OUT OF A GOVERNMENT AGENCY, VOTER VIOLATION, AND THE ONLY WAY YOU GET RID OF THE VIOLATION IS BY GOING AND VOTING FOR TED CRUZ. DO YOU EVER SEE THIS? PEOPLE DID THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID. IT WAS TERRIBLE. IT WAS A VERY FRAUDULENT THING. HE HAS DONE A LOT OF BAD THINGS. BEN CARSON IS A GREAT GUY. I THOUGHT THAT WAS A DISGRACE. HE SAID BASICALLY THE BEN CARSON IS OUT OF THE RACE. COME ON, VOTE FOR ME. ONE OF THOSE THINGS. I DO THINK THIS. I DO THINK THAT TED IS AT LEAST MOVING ALONG OK, BUT MARCO -- HOW DOES HE -- HAS TO GET OUT OF THE RACE. HAS TO. DESPITE WHAT TED SAID -- UGH, DO I WANT TO RUN AGAINST JUST TED. THAT WILL BE EASY. GO AHEAD. >>   YEAH. >>   WELL, I HAVE MADE IT VERY, VERY STRONG. WE HAVE POLICY ON IT. I'VE SAID IT VERY STRONGLY. I THINK YOU KNOW IT. HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY IT? IT IS LIKE -- AS AN EXAMPLE, WHAT IS MY POSITION ON 900 DIFFERENT THINGS? I SAID IT 150 TIMES. WE ARE NOT HERE FOR DISCUSSING THAT. BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW I FEEL ON IT. QUESTION? QUESTION? DAVID, SIT DOWN, PLEASE. YOU KNOW MY POSITION. JOHN, GO AHEAD.  IT'S WHAT IT SHOULD BE. BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONLY TWO THAT ARE WINNING. HE KEEPS SAYING ""I AM THE ONE WHO BEATS DONALD TRUMP."" WELL, I HAVE BEEN BEATING HIM ALMOST 3-1. ON SUPER TUESDAY, I GOT ONE MILLION MORE VOTES THAN MARCO AND I'VE HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE VOTES -- AND 500,000 MORE VOTES THAN TED. THAT'S A LOT OF VOTES.  HE IS NOT GOING TO WIN. YOU KNOW WHAT? THE CAN'T WIN -- HE CAN'T WIN. I'D LOVE TO HAVE A HEAD-TO-HEAD MATCHUP WITH HIM IN FLORIDA AND IN OHIO. BUT IN NEW YORK, HE'S NOT GOING TO GET VERY MANY VOTES. OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, NEW JERSEY, HE IS JUST NOT GOING TO GET VERY MANY VOTES. I WOULD LIKE MARCO TO DROP OUT. LOOK AT HOW HE DID TONIGHT. HE IS IN THIRD AND FOURTH. EVEN WHEN I DON'T WIN A STATE, I COME IN SECOND. THAT'S A BIG THING. MARCO IS COMING IN FOURTH. I THINK IT IS TIME FOR MARCO TO CLEAN THE DECK, I DO, AND I SAY THAT RESPECTFULLY.  MATT IS A GREAT GUY. LOOK, I WANTED TO GO TO KANSAS. I FELT I HAD AN OBLIGATION. I DID FAIRLY WELL IN KANSAS, CONSIDERING I SPENT LITERALLY AN HOUR THERE, VERY SMALL TIME. BUT I WANTED TO GO TO KANSAS TO CAMPAIGN. I HAVE -- I RESPECT THE PEOPLE AT CPAC. I RESPECT MATT GREAT DEAL --  MATT A GREAT DEAL. I HATED TO CANCEL. I'M CAMPAIGNING TO BE PRESIDENT. HAD I NOT GOING TO KANSAS THIS MORNING, I WOULD NOT HAVE DONE AS WELL AS I DID. I CAME IN SECOND. IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT THING.  JOHN, GO AHEAD. >>   GREAT. I HAVE TAKEN MORE QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS THAN ANY HUMAN BEING MAYBE THAT'S EVER LIVED. I MEAN, GIVE ME A BREAK. NO, I DON'T CARE. I WAS HEARING MATT SAY TODAY, I DID NOT LIKE THE FORMAT. I WOULD RATHER SPEAK FOR 30 MINUTES, BUT I HATE WHEN WE ARE INTERVIEWED OR USE SPEAK FOR 10 MINUTES, 15 MINUTES, THEN YOU'RE INTERRUPTED, YOU SIT DOWN. I HAVE DONE THAT. I HAVE DONE THAT THREE TIMES NOW. I WOULD RATHER SPEAK. IF SOMEONE ASKED ME IN THE CASE OF SEAN HANNITY, I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT. I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT. THIS WAS SIMPLY A FACT THAT I WANTED TO CAMPAIGN. VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE CAMPAIGNING. I'M VERY HAPPY I DID IT. I MET A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE IN KANSAS. MR. PHIL RUFFIN, ONE OF THE MOST UNITED -- MOST SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES. I FELT LIKE I OWED IT TO HIM TO GO THERE.  YES? >>   WE WOULD WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. I THINK OUR WEAKNESS IN DEALING WITH IRAN HAS BEEN UNPRECEDENTED. THE FACT THAT WE GAVE THEM $150 BILLION AND THEY ARE A TERRORIST STATE. THE FACT THAT THEY SPENT MUCH OF THAT MONEY BUYING OTHER THAN AMERICAN PRODUCTS. THEY BROUGHT 118 MASSIVE AIRPLANES -- BOX 118 MASSIVE AIRPLANES FROM -- THEY BOUGHT 118 MASSIVE AIRPLANES FROM AIRBUS. NOT FROM BOEING. I WILL GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT. I THINK IT IS A DISGRACE. PLEASE GIVE HIS FAMILY MY REGARDS. I THINK THEY KNOW WHERE HE IS. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, I THINK THEY ABSOLUTELY KNOW WHERE HE IS. IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT, I WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.   GO AHEAD. >>   WELL, I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. WHEN YOU HAVE 25,000 PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING. TODAY, WE HAD TO SEND AWAY SO MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. WHEN YOU HAVE THAT MANY PEOPLE, IF YOU HAVE FOUR OR FIVE PEOPLE STAND UP OUT OF 22,000 THAT ARE IN THIS HOLDING -- BUILDING, THAT I'M SPEAKING TO. A VERY GREAT ENTERTAINER SAID, DONALD, YOU ARE THE BIGGEST ENTERTAINER IN THE WORLD WITHOUT A GUITAR. WHICH IS SORT OF INTERESTING. I WON'T TELL YOU THAT WAS THE GREAT ELTON JOHN. I WON'T TELL YOU THAT. SOMEBODY DID MAKE THAT STATEMENT. WHEN YOU HAVE THAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD -- THE ROOM, YOU WILL HAVE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE -- SKIRMISHES. WE TREAT THEM VERY GENTLY. 10 YEARS AGO, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TREATED DIFFERENTLY, NOT BY ME. THAT'S THE WAY LIFE IS. WE TREAT THEM VERY GENTLY. WE HAD A FEW PROTESTERS TODAY, BUT VERY FEW. IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A PERCENTAGE, WE HAD 1/100 OF THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM.  LOOK, I WATCHED BERNIE SANDERS HAVE A PROTEST. HE WAS UP AT THE MICROPHONE AND TWO YOUNG LADIES CAME UP AND TOOK THE MICROPHONE AWAY FROM HIM. THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN TO ME. HE WALKED MEEKLY TO THE BACK OF THE ROOM. I SAID, ISN'T THAT PATHETIC, ISN'T THAT SAD? >>   THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH REPORTERS. JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND -- NOT ME. SOMEBODY ELSE. MARCO BROUGHT IT UP. YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS TO MARCO. LET ME TELL YOU, I DIDN'T BRING IT UP. EXCUSE ME, SOMEBODY ELSE SAID, DONALD TRUMP HAS SMALL HANDS. I SAID, SMALL HANDS THESE GUYS -- SMALL HANDS? THESE GUYS KNOW I HIT THE BALL 280. IS TRUMP STRONG? I SIMPLY HELD UP THE HAND. THESE ARE VERY STRONG HANDS, AND THEY ARE FAIRLY LARGE, ACTUALLY. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, IT WAS INTERESTING. YOU SHOULD NOT EVEN BE BRINGING THIS UP, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. BUT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING. BECAUSE THE DAY AFTER HE SAID THAT, I AM SHAKING HANDS WITH PEOPLE, AND EVERYBODY IS SAYING, WOW, YOU HAVE STRONG HANDS, YOU HAVE VERY GOOD HANDS. MARCO MADE IT UP OUT OF NOWHERE, BECAUSE HE IS A POLITICIAN. POLITICIANS LIE AND THEY SAY BAD THINGS. AND IF YOU DON'T CALL THEM OUT FOR IT -- I DIDN'T BRING IT UP. HE BROUGHT IT UP. AND I FINISHED IT. I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT MARCO. MARCO ATTACKED ME VICIOUSLY A WEEK AGO, TWO WEEKS AGO. SO FAR, EVERY PERSON THAT HAS ATTACKED ME HAS GONE DOWN. LOOK AT HIS NUMBERS TONIGHT. HE CANNOT HOLD ONE OF THOSE PHONY RALLIES WHERE HE DID WELL. HE DID REALLY BADLY. HE IS NOT GOING TO STAND UP TONIGHT AND TALK ABOUT HOW WELL HE DID IN IOWA, WHERE HE WAS IN THIRD PLACE AND HE ACTED LIKE HE WON. I AGREE WITH TED ON THAT. >>   HERE IS THE STORY. I WOULD LOVE IT TO BE AT A HIGH LEVEL. I WILL BE THE MOST PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN HISTORY OTHER THAN HONEST ABE LINCOLN. HE WAS VERY TOUGH TO BEAT. YOU LOOK AT ABE LINCOLN, HE WAS SERIOUS, RIGHT? BUT WHEN I GET ATTACKED BY THESE PEOPLE AT A LOW LEVEL, I HAVE TO ATTACK BACK. I CAN'T STAND THERE. SOME PEOPLE SAY YOU ARE ABOVE IT. I WILL NEVER DO THAT FOR OUR  YES, GO AHEAD.  I AM TOTALLY DENOUNCING -- ANY HATE GROUP, NO GOOD WITH DONALD TRUMP. ANY HATE GROUP. BUT IF YOU ARE TELLING ME, I WILL BELIEVE IT. I TOTALLY DENOUNCE, OK?  BULLYING? YEAH?  I WILL HELP THE PARTY FUNDRAISER, YES. I AM NOT LOOKING FOR FUNDS FOR MYSELF. I AM TOTALLY SELF FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN, BUT I WILL ABSOLUTELY HELP THE CAMP -- THE PARTY FUNDRAISER. I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY FOR MYSELF. GO AHEAD.  NO, I'M NOT. I THINK WE WILL WIN BEFORE THE CONVENTION. I THINK WE WILL WIN BEFORE. I HAVE SPONSORED A LOT OF SPORTING EVENTS. THE FIGHTERS HAVE A GREAT EXPRESSION. WHEN THEY GO INTO A CITY OR TOWN WHERE IT IS AN UNFRIENDLY TOWN BUT THEY THINK THEY ARE GOING TO WIN, THE ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING TO DO -- TO GUARANTEE VICTORY IS TO NOT THEM OUT. THE ONLY WAY I CAN GUARANTEE VICTORY IS TO GET ENOUGH DELEGATES. IF WE THINK ABOUT IT LIKE PRICE FIGHTERS DO, THAT'S CALLED A KNOCKOUT. WE THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO VERY WELL IN FLORIDA. WE HAVE THE TWO ONCE. -- ONES. LOUISIANA AND KENTUCKY TONIGHT FOR THE BIG ONES. WE DID WELL IN MAINE, BUT IT WAS MUCH SMALLER THAN LOUISIANA, KENTUCKY. KANSAS WAS ALSO SMALLER. WE CAME IN SECOND. BUT WE WON LOUISIANA AND KENTUCKY. THEY WERE THE BIG ONES. GO AHEAD.  OK. SO, THE QUESTION WAS ASKED ABOUT WATERBOARDING. WATERBOARDING IS A VERY TOUCHY SUBJECT. IT WAS ORIGINALLY ASKED TWO DECADES AGO TO TED CRUZ. HE SORT OF DIDN'T WANT ANY PART OF THAT QUESTION. I WATCHED AND I SAID WOW. THEY LOOK AT ME AND SAID, HOW DO YOU FEEL. I SAID, I'M TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF WATERBOARDING. AND IF WE CAN, I'D LIKE TO DO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND, WE ARE PLAYING BY A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES THAN ISIS AND OTHERS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. WE HAVE LAWS AND RULES AND REGULATIONS AND ALL OF THESE THINGS, AND THEY HAVE NOTHING. THEY JUMP OFF PEOPLE -- CHOP OFF PEOPLE'S HEADS. THEY DROWN PEOPLE IN MASSIVE STEEL CAGES. THEY DROPPED THE CASE FOR ONE HOUR, THEY LIFT IT UP AND THERE ARE 30 DEAD PEOPLE. HERE WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT WATERBOARDING. HERE IS THE STORY. I WILL OBEY THE LAWS, BUT I WILL TRY AND GET THE LAWS EXTENDED. I WILL TRY AND GET THE LAWS BROADENED. BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE ALLOWED -- BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN BEATING SOMEONE WHEN YOU'RE RULES ARE VERY SOFT AND THEIR RULES ARE UNLIMITED. THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO. AND I WANT TO PLAY --   LOOK, WE ARE GOING TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY. WE ARE GOING TO KNOCK OUT ISIS SO VIOLENTLY AND SO FAST. THEY CHOP OFF HEADS. THEY DO THINGS THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE MEDIEVAL TIMES, AND WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT WATERBOARDING. SIT DOWN. LET ME JUST TELL YOU. EXCUSE ME. I WANT TO STAY WITHIN THE LAWS. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE THE LAWS. I WANT TO MAKE THOSE LAWS STRONGER SO THAT WE CAN BETTER COMPETE WITH A VICIOUS GROUP OF ANIMALS, OK? OK. YES, GO AHEAD. >>   I LOVE -- YEAH, I THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO GREAT. WE HAVE A 20 POINT LEAD I THINK IN FLORIDA.  LOOK, MITT ROMNEY WAS A FAILED CANDIDATE. HE WAS A TERRIBLE CANDIDATE. HE CHOKED. HE ABSOLUTELY CHOKED AS BAD AS I HAD NEVER SEEN, OTHER THAN MARCO WHEN CHRIS CHRISTIE WAS GRILLING HIM. THAT WAS A BIG JOKE ALSO -- CHOKE ALSO. I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO COLLAPSE. I WAS GETTING READY TO HOLD HIM UP WITH THESE VERY POWERFUL HANDS, OK?   THAT WAS A JOKE -- CHOKE. MITT ROMNEY CHOKED AS A CANDIDATE. HE KNOWS HOW I FEEL. WHEN HE WAS THINKING OF GETTING INTO THE RACE SEVEN MONTHS AGO, EIGHT MONTHS AGO, I SAID -- SO IMPORTANT. I SAID YOU CANNOT LET MITT ROMNEY IN THIS RACE. HE IS A CHOKER. YOU KNOW, THROUGH SPORTS -- I CAN TELL YOU, I HAVE SOME GREAT SPORTSMANEN RIGHT HERE. ONCE A CHOKER, ALWAYS A CHOKER. MITT ROMNEY GAVE THAT ELECTION AWAY. THAT WAS AN ELECTION AGAINST A FAILED PRESIDENT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN EASILY WON. MITT ROMNEY DID NOT WORK HARD. THAT LAST MONTH, HE DISAPPEARED. SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA. HE WAS ON ""JAY LENO,"" ""DAVID LETTERMAN."" HE WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND WHERE WAS MITT ROMNEY? WE ARE ALL STILL LOOKING FOR HIM. IF HE WOULD HAVE DEVOTED THE SAME TIME AND ENERGY TO WINNING THE PRESIDENCY FOUR YEARS AGO AS HE IS NOW TO DESTROYING OUR PARTY AND THE UNITY OF OUR PARTY, HE WOULD HAVE WON THE ELECTION AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE PROBLEMS WE DO NOW. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. THIS HAS BEEN AMAZING, VERY EXCITING. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU MANY TIMES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.     ","Donald Trump News Conference in West Palm Beach, Florida"

WHAT A TURNOUT.  WHAT A TURNOUT. WOW!   THANK YOU.  I WANT TO THANK PAUL. I LOVE TOUGH PEOPLE. YOU NEED TOUGH PEOPLE AND HE'S A TOUGH COOKIE. AND WHEN WE GOT HIS ENDORSEMENT, WE WERE THRILLED, I TELL YOU THAT.  HE IS A GREAT GUY. YOU KNOW, I WAS DOING A LITTLE   BIT OF A THING CALLED THE DEBATES --   [CROWD  GET THEM OUT, PLEASE. GET THEM OUT. WHAT ARE THEY DOING? WHAT'S THE PURPOSE?  I GUESS A LITTLE TELEVISION TIME, I GUESS. YOU KNOW, I WAS GOING TO THE   DEBATE AND I WAS GOING DIRECTLY  IN FLORIDA AND DOING REALLY WELL IN FLORIDA. AND CAMPAIGNING AGAINST THE GUY  WHO HAS THE WORST VOTING RECORD  IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF   FLORIDA NAMED RUBIO. I CALL HIM LIGHT WEIGHT. HE'S A LIGHT WEIGHT. WORST HISTORY IN FLORIDA.  LET'S HOPE I DO WELL THERE. I LOVE FLORIDA.  BUT I WAS GOING TO DETROIT AND I SAID TO MY PEOPLE, I HAVE TO   STOP IN MAINE. I JUST HAD TO STOP IN MAINE.   I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S A VERY DIRECT ROUTE. INSTEAD OF GOING THIS WAY, I   WENT THIS WAY AND THAT IS GOOD. AND I'M SO GLAD. TO PUT THIS INCREDIBLE SOLDOUT CROWD AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE  OUTSIDE, TO PUT THIS CROWD TOGETHER IN A PERIOD OF WHAT, 24 HOURS? [CHEERS  AND MAINE IS AMAZING. MAINE IS ONE OF THE MOST   BEAUTIFUL PLACES ON EARTH AND  PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE HOW LARGE   YOUR LAND MASS IS. AS LARGE AS ALL OF NEW ENGLAND   WHEN YOU THINK OF IT. THAT'S SOME PIECE OF LAND. CAN I BUY SOME? CAN I BUY SOME     I HAVE BEEN WATCHING  WITH GREAT INTEREST, WE HAVE HAD AMAZING RESULTS AND WITH NEW HAMPSHIRE, IT WAS AN AMAZING AND INCREDIBLE THING. AND EVERY SINGLE TIME I WENT TO  NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHENEVER I MET  WITH PEOPLE, THEY WOULD SAY  NUMBER ONE PROBLEM, NUMBER ONE PROBLEM, HEROIN. NUMBER ONE PROBLEM. AND I WOULD SAY HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?  YOU LOOK AT THE BEAUTIFUL FIELDS AND BEAUTIFUL LITTLE ROADS AND   EVERYTHING IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND IT WAS THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEM AND COMES FROM OUR SOUTHERN  BORDER AND WE ARE GOING TO CLOSE UP THAT BORDER AND GOING TO  BUILD A WALL AND STOP THE DRUGS  FROM COMING IN. BELIEVE ME.    AND PEOPLE ARE GOING  TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY BUT GOING TO COME IN LEGALLY.  GOING TO COME IN LEGALLY. AND WE ARE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I WATCHED THESE PUNDITS, MY WIFE AND I CAME DOWN THE ELEVATOR AND FIRST STARTED AND IT WAS AMAZING. I SAID WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING, DON'T  KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN RUNNING OUR COUNTRY. JUST IN HEARING SOME OF THESE THINGS.  WE HAVE TO DO IT. AND IT TAKES GUTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I'M NOT A POLITICIAN. ALL TALK, NO ACTION, NOTHING   GETS DONE. ANY WAY, WE ARE COMING DOWN AND I SAID TO MYSELF, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SO MANY THINGS AND I   WATCHED THE PUNDITS AND THEY SAID, TRUMP, I DON'T KNOW, WE  HAVE SOME DEBATE TALENT RUNNING  AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE? WHERE? WHAT'S THE TALENT? YOU COME DOWN AND START TALKING ABOUT TRADE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH TRADE.  TRADE HAS BEEN SUCH A DISASTER.  BUT THE PUNDITS ALL SAID, I CAME OUT AT 3%, FIRST ONE.  MY WIFE SAID IF YOU RUN, YOU ARE GOING TO WIN.  YOU CAN'T SAY, EVEN IF THEY CALL IT, PEOPLE STILL SAY YOU AREN'T  GOING TO RUN. IF YOU RUN, YOU ARE GOING TO WIN. SHE'S MY POLLSTER. I PAY HER LESS MONEY. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS? I STARTED AT 3, THE FIRST DAY OR SOMETHING. WHICH I WASN'T THRILLED ABOUT  AND WENT UP TO 6, 12, 18 AND KEPT GOING UP AND EVERY TIME I WENT UP, THEY WOULD SAY HE WAS PLATEAUED. WE'LL, HE'S ALWAYS GOING TO GET  6. THEN I WENT UP TO 12.  THEN I WENT UP TO 24. AND THAT'S FOR 17 PEOPLE.  WE HAD 17 PEOPLE. 24, 17 PEOPLE, THAT'S A LOT. AND THEY SAID THAT'S THE MAX AND WENT UP TO 28, 32 SO CNN JUST  CAME OUT WITH A POLL.  TRUMP, 49.   THAT'S HIGH.  AND I'M VERY PROUD OF IT,  BECAUSE THIS ISN'T A PLATEAU BUT A MOVEMENT.  WE HAVE A MOVEMENT GOING ON,   FOLKS. TIME MAGAZINE DID A STORY  RECENTLY, A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO  TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON  AND NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. THEY SAY ACTUALLY AND I DON'T THINK I'M EX AGER ATING BUT MANY OF THE GREAT WRITERS WHICH THERE ARE VERY FEW BECAUSE MANY OF THE WRITERS ARE AMONG THE MOST DISHONEST PEOPLE I EVER DEALT  WITH, BUT THEY SAID IN THE   HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY, THERE   HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE   THIS. WE WERE IN HUNTSVILLE, ALABAMA,  WE HAD 35,000 PEOPLE. 35,000 PEOPLE. WE WERE -- WE WENT TO ARKANSAS.  OH, IS THAT ANOTHER ONE? GET THEM OUT.  GET THEM OUT. GET THEM OUT. THEY JUST DON'T STOP. GET THEM OUT.  THANK YOU. BYE-BYE. BYE-BYE. TERRIBLE. INCREDIBLE.  NOW YOU KNOW, YOU CAN BE NICE IF YOU ARE NICE, THEY WILL SAY YOU  WERE SOFT. AND YOU CAN BE VICIOUS, GET OUT  OF HERE! AND THEN SAY -- PLEASE GET THEM OUT.   IT'S INCREDIBLE.  I LOVE YOU, TOO. I LOVE YOU, TOO. I LOVE YOU, TOO. I'M SELF-FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN AND PUTTING UP MY OWN MONEY. BUT YOU HAVE TO DO -- I DON'T  WANT YOUR MONEY, I JUST WANT   YOUR VOTE ON SATURDAY.   DON'T FORGET, I DID   THAT BIG LONG TURN, SLIGHTLY   LONG. BIG TURN.  SO YOU CAN GET OUT THE VOTE, OK.   SO -- THANK YOU.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO OUR COUNTRY AND OUR THEME IS  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AND OVER THE LAST LITTLE WHILE,  I HAVE MET SO MANY PEOPLE,   THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. WE HAVE LIKE THIS -- WE ARE ONLY CONFINED BY THE SIZE OF THE ROOM.  THIS IS PACKED BUT THIS IS THE   SIZE OF THE ROOM.  THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF   GREAT, GREAT AMERICANS.  AND I HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE IN THIS COUNTRY NOW THAN I EVER HAD BEFORE. I HAVE SEEN -- I MEAN MILLIONS   OF PEOPLE, REALLY, BECAUSE WHEN  YOU GET 35,000, 40,000 PEOPLE FOR RALLIES AND WE HAVE BY FAR THE BIGGEST RALLIES. BERNIE IS SECOND.  I HAVE TO GIVE HIM CREDIT. BUT WE HAVE BY FAR THE BIGGEST. AND I SEE BY FAR THE MOST PEOPLE AND THIS COUNTRY HAS UNBELIEVABLE PEOPLE THAT LOVE  OUR COUNTRY. JUST REMEMBER THAT.    I WANT TO SEE THE DAY IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE  WHEN APPLE MAKES THEIR IPHONES IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOT IN CHINA AND ALL OF THESE OTHER COUNTRIES.   NOW, I HEARD AND I  SAW JUST A LITTLE BIT OF IT BUT I HEARD THAT MITT ROMNEY MADE A FAIRLY LONG SPEECH.  AND HONESTLY, I'LL ADDRESS IT  QUICKLY BECAUSE IT'S IRRELEVANT.   HIT IS A FAILED CANDIDATE. HE FAILED HORRIBLY.    THAT WAS A RACE I HAVE TO SAY FOLKS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN WON. THAT WAS A RACE THAT ABSOLUTELY SHOULD HAVE BEEN WON.  AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED   TO HIM. HE DISAPPEARED. HE DISAPPEARED. AND I WASN'T HAPPY ABOUT IT,   I'LL BE HONEST, BECAUSE I'M NOT  A FAN OF BARACK OBAMA AND THAT WAS A RACE THAT I BACKED MITT  ROMNEY.  AND I BACKED HIM. YOU CAN SEE HOW LOYAL, HE WAS BEGGING. I COULD HAVE SAID DROP TO YOUR KNEES. HE WOULD HAVE DROPPED TO HIS KNEES. HE WAS BEGGING ME. AND HE SAID I'M NOT BIG LIKE HIM AND GREAT BUSINESSMAN. SINCE THEN, I HAVE DONE MUCH   BETTER.  BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT IN A SECOND.  HIT WAS THINKING ABOUT RUNNING AGAIN. HE RAN A HORRIBLE CAMPAIGN.  IT WAS A CAMPAIGN THAT NEVER   SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOST. YOU ARE RUNNING AGAINST A FAILED PRESIDENT. HE CAME UP WITH 47%, HE DEMEANED 47% OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY, THE FAMOUS 47%. ONCE THAT WAS SAID, I'LL BE HONEST, ONCE THAT WAS SAID, A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS   OVER FOR HIM. THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF, HE DISAPPEARED. I CALLED HIS PEOPLE AND SAID YOU HAVE TO DO YOURSELF A FAVOR. OBAMA, HE WAS ON JAY LENO AND DAVID LETTERMAN. HIT WAS LOOKING FOR ZONING FOR NINE-CAR GARAGES.  WHO CARS ABOUT A GARAGE. YOU ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. AND HIT WAS A DISASTER AS A CANDIDATE. SO WHAT HAPPENED, AND IT WAS   VERY STRONG AND I THINK IF THE   PRESS GOES BACK, THEY'LL SEE IT. WHEN I HEARD HE WAS RUNNING  AGAIN AND I WASN'T SURE I WAS GOING TO BE RUNNING, BUT I WAS VERY, VERY STRONG TO HIT AND EVERYBODY, BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM.  I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED, BECAUSE   HE LET US DOWN.  HE LET US DOWN.  ONE THING YOU LOSE AND YOU WORK  AND YOU WORK, HE LET US DOWN.  HE SHOULD HAVE WON.  SOMETHING HAPPENED.  HE WENT AWAY.  HE WAS GONE. HE WAS HORRIBLE IN THE THIRD DEBATE. IT WAS A HORRIBLE -- SOMETHING   HAPPENED.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.  MAYBE SOMEDAY THEY'LL WRITE A  BOOK. HIS CAMPAIGN GUY WAS TERRIBLE. HE IS ALWAYS ON TELEVISION. STUART STEVENS. HE RAN ONE OF THE WORST  CAMPAIGNS IN THE HISTORY OF MODERN POLITICS. AND HIT RAN PROBABLY WAS THE WORST ONE BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE  THOUGHT THAT THE REPUBLICAN  CANDIDATE WOULD WIN. SO WHEN HIT STARTED RAISING HIS  HEAD A FEW MONTHS AGO, I VERY  STRONG.  I SAID MITT ROMNEY SHOULD NOT  RUN. HE IS A CHOKE ARTIST AND I SAID  IT VERY STRONGLY. AND THEN JEB BUSH ACTUALLY   CONVINCED HIT NOT TO RUN.  CAN YOU IMAGINE JEB, JEB TOLD  HIM. JEB, HE IS A GOOD SALESMAN.  JEB IS A GOOD SALESMAN.  HE'S A HIGH-ENERGY SALESMAN. BUT HIT WAS AFRAID OF JEB  BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID THAT JEB   WOULD GET THE MONEY AND JEB  WOULD GET WHATEVER.  I WASN'T AFRAID. I WASN'T AFRAID OF JEB.  I CAN TELL YOU THAT. JEB BUSH CONVINCED HIT NOT TO RUN. THIS WAS GOING TO BE A THIRD ONE. SECOND A GREAT CATASTROPHE. AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS HE WENT TO SEE JEB AND JEB HAD HIM CONVINCED HE HAS THE MONEY AND HIT CHICKENED OUT. I'LL TELL YOU THE REAL REASON HE CHICKENED OUT, IT WAS ME. IF YOU REMEMBER HIT WAS ALL SET TO RUN.  I KNOW THIS FROM PEOPLE THAT ARE CLOSE TO HIM AND I THINK HE HAS A DESIRE MAYBE AT THE CONVENTION TO GET SOME KIND OF A THING. HILLARY CLINTON WILL DESTROY HIM. ASSUMING SHE IS ALLOWED TO RUN AND ASSUMING SHE IS NOT ARRESTED FOR THE EMAILS DCH   [CHEERS AND  WHICH IS SO TERRIBLE. BUT LET'S ASSUME THAT THE  DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO PROTECT   HER, LET'S ASSUME THAT I WILL BE RUNNING AGAINST HILLARY. I WOULD LOVE TO RUN AGAINST  HILLARY. AND BY THE WAY, WE HAVE NUMEROUS POLLS SHOW ME BEATING HER EASILY.  SHE CALLED ME SEXIST AND I HIT   HER WITH THE HUSBAND AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I EVER HEARD THE WORD SEXIST. SO THAT WAS IT. THEY HAD A ROUGH WEEKEND. BILL WAS NOT HAPPY.  I GUARANTEE YOU, HE SAID DON'T YOU EVER SAY THAT TO HIM AGAIN. SAY IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE, BUT NOT TO TRUMP.  THAT WAS A ROUGH, ROUGH WEEKEND. BUT HIT WAS GOING TO RUN AS SURE AS YOU ARE STANDING HERE.  BUT HE WAS GOING TO RUN I YOU WAS VERY, VERY ANGRY THAT HE WAS GOING TO RUN.  I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS GOING TO BE THIS, BUT I FELT I WANTED TO. NBC WANTED TO EXTEND ""THE  APPRENTICE"" FOR 26 EPISODES. STEVE BURKE, PLEASE, DONALD, WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO ""THE APPRENTICE."" THE RATINGS AFTER 14 SEASONS WERE STILL DEBATE. AND I SAID STEVE, I THINK I'M  GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.  NO. NO.  NO YOU'RE NOT. THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO BECAUSE   THE SHOW DOES GREAT. AND ULTIMATELY I DECIDED TO RUN. AND EQUAL TIME LAWS, YOU CAN'T DO BOTH. HOW IS ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER DOING? ARGED? TRUMP? WELL, WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT IF ARNOLD IS QUICK, BECAUSE IF   HE'S NOT QUICK"" AND WHEN THE   THEM COMING AT YOU, YOU HAVE TO  BE QUICK AND SMART.  I HOPE HE DOES WELL. I HOPE ARGED DOES WELL.  THEY -- ARNOLD DOES WELL. THEY RENEWED THE SHOW WITH ME IN THE UPFRONTS AND I GAVE UP A LOT OF DEALS AND THINGS TO DO THIS,  TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE TRYING TO GET IN.  CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? HOW ABOUT EVERYBODY CLEAR OUT  AND LET A NEW GROUP COME IN? WHEN I HEARD HIT WAS GOING TO RUN A LITTLE BEFORE THIS PERIOD  OF TIME, I WAS VERY TOUGH. I SAID HE CAN'T RUN. HE CAN'T RUN.  HE WAS GOING TO RUN. HE CAN'T RUN AND I SAID LOOK WE  HAVE TO KEEM HIM OUT.  HE IS A CHOKE ARTIST. AND I STARTED HITTING HIM SO   HARD. WE CANNOT TAKE ANOTHER LOSS. WE CANNOT TAKE ANOTHER LOSS. AND HIT IS INDEED A CHOKE ARTIST AND CHOKED LIKE I NEVER SEEN ANYONE CHOKE OTHER THAN WHEN RUBIO WHEN CHRIS CHRISTIE WAS GRILLING HIM. THAT WAS ONE OF THE GREAT CHOKES.  HE WAS STANDING THERE, SHAKING AND SWEATING. RIGHT OVER HERE. I'M GETTING READY TO GRAB HIM BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING   DOWN. BUT HIT DID A BIG SULK.  A COUPLE OF THINGS I HEARD HE SAID.  FIRST OF ALL, HE DOESN'T MENTION THE FACT THAT I BUILT A CITY ON THE WEST SIDE OF MANHATTAN OR BUILDINGS ON THE WEST SIDE OF MANHATTAN AND TALKING ABOUT A BEEF AND WATER COMPANY. I SUPPLY ALL MY CLUBS WITH THE WATER. NUMEROUS THOSE THINGS. THE MAGAZINE, OTHER THINGS. GET THEM OUT. GET THEM OUT. GET THEM OUT. SPEAKING OF MEXICO, I WON THE HISPANIC VOTE BY FAR IN NEVADA, RIGHT?   WE WON THE HISPANIC VOTE IN NEVADA IN THE POLLS. WE WON NEVADA, WE WON SOUTH CAROLINA, NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THEN THE BIG, BIG TUESDAY WHERE WE  WON A TREMENDOUS NUMBER. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS. SO ULTIMATELY HIT CHICKENED OUT  AND NOW HE'S SAYING THAT HILLARY IS VERY WEAK. BUT ULTIMATELY HE DIDN'T. HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BEATEN VERY BADLY. A COUPLE OF THINGS WERE  MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE TO  DISCUSS. FIRST OF ALL WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT ME, I WROTE A COUPLE OF THEM   DOWN.  THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT 92-STORY BUILDINGS ALL OVER THE PLACE, DON'T TALK ABOUT THE BANK OF AMERICA BUILDING IN SAN FRANCISCO, 1290 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS OR THE WEST SIDE RAIL ROAD YARDS WHERE I BUILT A CITY ON THE WEST SIDE OF MANHATTAN  AND DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT 40 WALL STREET BUT WANT TO TALK   ABOUT WATER, WHICH I STILL HAVE. I SUPPLY ALL MY CLUBS. THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT A MAGAZINE AND I HAVE A MAGAZINE THAT GOES TO ALL MY CLUBS. BY THE WAY, A SCHOOL, LITTLE   DEAL, BUT I LOVED IT WHEN IT WAS THERE, TRUMP UNIVERSITY, BUT I WILL TELL YOU, JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND, THE SCHOOL HAD 98% APPROVAL RATING. AN ATTORNEY FELT I COULD SUE   TRUMP AND GET SOMETHING. 98% OF THE PEOPLE TOOK THE COURSES WE SIGNED REPORT CARDS.  YOU PUT SOMEBODY UP IN THE STAND, DID YOU RIGHT THIS --   WRITE THIS. THEY DID A COMMERCIAL THAT TOOK IT DOWN WHERE TWO PEOPLE WERE  SAYING NEGATIVES AND WE SHOWED THE STATEMENTS AND HAD TO TAKE   THE COMMERCIAL DOWN. 98% OF THE PEOPLE THAT TOOK THE COURSES SAID REALLY WONDERFUL  THINGS ABOUT IT. IT GOT AN A FROM THE BETTER  BUSINESS BUREAU. I THINK HOW DO I SETTLE A CASE LIKE THIS. B-PLUS WOULD BE OK, TOO. BUT WE DID BETTER THAN A B-PLUS. SO AND HERE'S ONE THING I SAY  ABOUT BUSINESS. I WATCH THESE BANKERS AND THEY GET MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. 40 MILLION AND 50 MILLION AND  WILL SETTLE WITH THE GOVERNMENT FOR $2 BILLION, $5 BILLION, $12 BILLION. I SAY WHY DORNT YOU FIGHT IT?  IF YOU DON'T FIGHT IT, SOMEONE   IS GOING TO SUE YOU. NEXT WEEK THEY GET SUED AGAIN. YOU HAVE TO FIGHT THESE THINGS   OUT. YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT'S OUT. WITH THE UNIVERSITY, I KNEW I  COULD GET SOME BAD PUBLICITY. DO WE AGREE WITH THAT, BY THE WAY? IT'S A VERY SMALL CASE, CIVIL  CASE AND I'M GOING TO WIN IT IN  COURT AND COST ME MORE MONEY TO  WIN IT IN COURT THAN TO SETTLE.  LOUSY TIMING BECAUSE TOO BUSY IT WASN'T LATER BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.  ANY BUSINESSMAN OR WOMAN HAS   LAWSUITS.  PEOPLE SUE TO GET THEIR MONEY  BACK, THEY SUE FOR THIS AND SUE FOR A MILLION DIFFERENT REASONS. 98% APPROVAL RATING, A FROM THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE CASE.  IT WILL BE FOREVER BECAUSE IT TAKES FOREVER. I DON'T LIKE TO SETTLE CASES. BECAUSE ONCE YOU SETTLE CASES  EVERYBODY SAYS HE IS A SETTLER,  LET'S SUE. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T SUE ME   BECAUSE THEY SAY IT'S TOO HARD.  [CHEERS AND  ONE OF THE THINGS   THAT HIT BROUGHT UP WHICH IS SO  SERIOUS HE SAID ABOUT TRADE. WE HAVE TO KEEP TRADE, NOBODY  KNOWS MORE ABOUT TRADE THAN ME.  I MADE SO MUCH MORE MONEY THAN HIT. I HAVE A A STORE THAT'S WORTH  MORE MONEY THAN HIT. I MADE THAT STATEMENT JOCKINGLY  WHEN I WAS IN IOWA AND ""THE ""DES MOINES REGISTER"" WHICH IS A TERRIBLE PAPER, BUT THEY SAID  THAT'S A TERRIBLE STATEMENT,   THAT'S A TERRIBLE STATEMENT. AND THE PEOPLE PUT ME ON AND   SAID WHAT ARE YOU SAYING.  THEY SAID YOU HAVE A STORE THAT IS WORTH MORE THAN HIT.  I SAID WHAT'S HE WORTH?  THEY SAID $150 MILLION.  IT'S THE GUCCI STORE.  I SAID IT'S MUCH MORE. WE DON'T BELIEVE THE STORE IS WORTH $150 MILLION.  THEY GOT THREE APPRAISEORS AND   SAID THAT STORE IS WORTH FROM  $400 MILLION TO A BILLION TWO. CHECK YOUR LOCAL ""DES MOINES REGISTER."" I'M NOT SURE IT'S STILL OPEN.  I BUILT AN AMAZING COMPANY. AND ONE OF THE REASONS YOU KNOW WHAT'S AMAZING, THE HOTTEST DEVELOPMENT, THE HOTTEST DEVELOPMENT SITE PROBABLY IN THE HISTORY OF THE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, G.S.A., THAT'S THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE IS THE  OLD POST OFFICE SITE. THAT'S WHERE IT IS BUILT IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,, AN ENTIRE BLOCK FRONTING ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. IF I DID DON'T GET THERE, I'M  GETTING TO THE WHITE HOUSE. FRONTING ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE  BUT ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS. AND THE G.S.A. FOR MANY, MANY  YEARS OWNED IT AND WANTED TO   DEVELOP IT FOR 30, 35 YEARS AND  NEVER WORKED OUT. BIG JOB. AND NEVER HAPPENED. AND WENT TO BID. AND IN BIDDING IT THEY HAD MORBIDERS AND MORE HIGH-LEVEL BIDDERS. LET'S ASSUME JUST ABOUT THE  HOTTEST JOB THAT THEY HAVE EVER  PUT OUT TO BID. EVERY HOTEL COMPANY WANTED IT. I'M BUILDING A 300-ROOM SUPER LUXURY HOTEL.  EVERYBODY WANTED IT. THEY WENT OUT TO A PUBLIC BID. AND ONE OF THE THINGS IN CHOOSING THE BIDDER IS HOW   STRONG IS THE BIDDER AND HOW GOOD IS THE BIDDER'S IDEA. THEY LOVED MY IDEA. THIS BIB ONE OF THE GREAT HOTELS IN THE WORLD. TWO YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. GOING TO OPEN IN SEPTEMBER. WE ARE TWO YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND THE G.S.A. PEOPLE   ARE TERRIFIC AND WE ARE UNDER BUDGET. THE REASON IS THAT I'M USING MARBLE INSTEAD OF TERRAZA. A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. WE ARE GOING THE HIGHEST END.  THE REASON I GOT CHOSEN WAS BECAUSE MY FINANCIAL STATEMENT   WAS SO STRONG BECAUSE IT COULD GUARANTEE COMPLETION.  AND NUMBER TWO, WE HAD THE BEST  IDEA. WHEN I LISTEN TO THIS MYTH AND THIS IS IN THE OBAMA   ADMINISTRATION. I WOULDN'T SAY I HAD AN  ADVANTAGE. I SAID TO MY DAUGHTER AND SHE  WAS VERY MUCH INVOLVED WITH THAT, I SAID MAYBE, MAYBE WE   AREN'T GOING TO GET IT. BUT MY FINANCIAL STATEMENT IS SO STRONG AND I PUT IT IN -- ROMNEY TALKS ABOUT TAXES. TAXES MAYBE THIS. VERY LITTLE DO YOU LEARN FROM TAXES. YOU CAN'T LEARN VERY MUCH. BUT I DID FILE ALMOST 100 PAGES OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH THE FEDERAL ELECTIONS AND IT SHOWS THAT I HAVE A NET WORTH THAT COULD BE OVER $10 BILLION, PROBABLY OVER. AND I DON'T DO THAT IN A BRAGGING WAY. I TELL YOU BECAUSE THAT'S THE  KIND OF THINKING WE NEED.  WE HAVE $19 TRILLION WAS -- PAUL WAS SAYING.  $19 TRILLION IN DEBT. I HAVE VERY LOW DEBT AND TREMENDOUS CASH FLOW. AND I FOUND MY FINANCIALS. HE SAID MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING IN HIS TAX RETURN. BUT I GET AUDITED EVERY SINGLE   YEAR AND BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS  SO BIG, FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES EVERY YEAR. BECAUSE MY COMPANY IS SO BIG OR SOME OF THE REASON WHICH IS UNFAIR.  LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT. THEY AUDIT ME EVERY YEAR.  I THINK IT'S UNFAIR. BUT I HAVE BEEN AUDITED EVERY YEAR FOR MANY YEARS. I HAVE NOTHING -- AND NOBODY IN  THIS ROOM WOULD SAY YOU ARE  BEING AUDITED. YOU GET AUDITED AND FINISH UP THE AUDIT, ROUTINE STUFF AND   RELEASE THE TAX RETURNS. IF HIT WOULD LIKE TO GO DOWN TO THE FEDERAL ELECTION OFFICE YOU WILL SEE 100 PAGES OF FINANCIALS THAT WERE FILED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.  I COULD HAVE DELAYED IT FOR SIX MONTHS.  I FILED THEM FOR 30 DAYS AND I HAD TO WORK WITH THE ACCOUNTANTS AND THEY WORKED OVERTIME BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT THEM SAYING HE IS  ASKING FOR EXTENSIONS. SO WITH HIT, I JUST WANTED TO  TELL YOU, HE CAME OUT, IT WAS  VERY NASTY. I THOUGHT HE WAS A BETTER PERSON THAN THAT. I HELPED HIM.  I RAISED MONEY FOR HIS CAMPAIGN  AND TWO FUNDRAISERS FOR HIM. THE FIRST ONE WAS SO SUCCESSFUL  THAT WE HAD THE SECOND ONE THAT  SAME DAY.  HIS WIFE WHICH IS A REALLY   LOVELY WOMAN.  SHE CAME UP AND HAD A FUNDRAISER IN MY APARTMENT AT TRUMP TOWER.  I DID A GREAT JOB. THEY COULDN'T HAVE CAREDLESS.  THEY SAID DONALD, HE IS A STIFF, HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN. I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THE  GUY. BUT WE HAD A FUNDRAISER AND IT   WAS SO BIG AND RAINING OUT, I  WON'T FORGET ABOUT THIS. IT WAS A MISERABLE, MISERABLE  DAY AND PEOPLE CAME IN, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE PHASE ONE AND SAID   THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE TO PUT   THEM IN ONE AND CALLED FOR   ANOTHER ONE AFTER. AND BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S SHOES  WERE SO WET, I RUINED MY CARPET. THIS CARPET WAS WIPED OUT AND  NOBODY THANKED ME FOR THE CARPET.  MAYBE I COULD SEND HIT A BILL  FOR CARPET RUINED. WHEN YOU HELP SOMEBODY, WHEN YOU HELP SOMEBODY, I MADE SIX ROBOT  CALLS. EVERY SINGLE PLACE I MADE, HE  WON. NORTH CAROLINA.  SIX DIFFERENT PLACES. YOU HELPED SOMEBODY AND THEN HE TURNS. NOW, I WILL SAY THIS. I WILL SAY THIS. I WILL SAY THIS. HE PROBABLY HAD A RIGHT TO TURN, BECAUSE NOBODY COULD HAVE BEEN NASS NASTIER THAN ME.  AND THE REASON I SAID THAT.  I LOVE OUR COUNTRY TOO MUCH. IF HE WOULD HAVE RUN AND EVEN IF HE WOULD HAVE WON, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BAD. HE DOESN'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BE PRESIDENT.  HE DOESN'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BE PRESIDENT. SO I DO WANT TO MENTION ONE THING BECAUSE IT WORKED SO WELL  BECAUSE HIS SPEECH WAS SO LONG   AND COVERED A LOT OF TERRITORY.  HE DIDN'T MENTION THE MANY BUILDINGS AND BUILDING OVER 120 JOBS ALL OVER THE WORLD. WE JUST GOT TURNBERRY AND D OMP RAL AND THEY ARE HAVING THE  WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP TODAY IN  FLORIDA AND NIMEA IN MAINE.  ROARY AND EVERYBODY IS DOWN  THERE. AND TIGER IS GOING DOWN THERE. BUT THEY'RE ALL THERE. ALL AT MY PLACE AND HERE I AM  MAKING A SPEECH IN MAINE, OK. SO IF I DON'T WIN ON SATURDAY,   I'LL SAY BOY, WAS A MISTAKE. ANY WAY, I THINK WE WILL. HE TALKED ABOUT TRADE. TALKED DOMESTIC. BYE-BYE. BYE-BYE. BYE-BYE. GET THEM OUT. GET THEM OUT.  I LOVE YOU, TOO. THESE PEOPLE.  I TELL YOU WHAT, YOUR POLICE ARE FANTASTIC. DO WE LOVE OUR POLICE?   WHERE WOULD WE BE   WITHOUT THEM IN ALL FAIRNESS? THEY ARE SO ABUSED AND ONE   STUPID INCIDENT OR BAD INCIDENT OR ONE BAD PERSON, WHICH HAPPENS OUT OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND IT'S THE BIGGEST STORY IN THE  NEWS AND IT PLAYS FOREVER AND  PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE HOW GREAT A JOB THE POLICE OF THIS COUNTRY DO, I HAVE TO TELL YOU. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HIT  WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS DOMESTIC   POLICY AND WE NEED TRADE AND WE  NEED TRADE AND WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH CHINA AND DEAL WITH ALL   THESE PEOPLE, LOOK. LAST YEAR IN TERMS OF A TRADE  DEFICIT WE LOST WITH CHINA $500 BILLION. WE LOST WITH MEXICO. THAT'S WHY MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL, FOLKS. MEXICO, LOOK, THE WALL, IT'S ACTUALLY 2,000 MILES. WE HAVE A LOT OF NATURAL BARRIERS.  WALL IS GOING TO COST $10 BILLION. GOING TO BE A TRUMP WALL AND   BRING IT IN UNDER BUDGET. I HAVE TO NAME IT AFTER MYSELF BECAUSE MAYBE -- SHOULD I NAME IT AFTER MYSELF? I DON'T THINK SO.  BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A REAL WALL AND GOING TO BE GREAT. STOP DRUGS POURING INTO MAINE AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. WALLS WORK. PROPERLY DONE, WALLS WORK. THEY COME UP TO ME AND SAY, BUT MEXICO WILL NEVER PAY. POLITICIANS SAY, BUT DONALD -- FIRST THEY SAID THERE IS NO WALL. YOU CAN'T BILT A WALL. CHINA BUILT A WALL THAT IS 13,000 MILES. 2,000 MILES, WE CAN DO IT. I HEAR CRUZ SAYING WE CAN'T BUILD A WALL AND WE HEARD HIM SAY, WE ARE GOING TO A BUILD A WALL. I DON'T KNOW IF RUBIO SAID IT. I THINK RUBIO HAS BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN WORRYING ABOUT WALLS. HERE'S THE THING WE HAVE WITH MEXICO A $58 BILLION TRADE DEFICIT. IF THE WALL COSTS $10 BILLION, A TINY FRACTION, I GUARANTEE YOU   THAT MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL JUST AS SURE AS YOU ARE STANDING THERE. A POLITICIAN WOULDN'T SAY THAT. AND VINCENTE FOX THREW THE F-WORD OUT. F-BOMB. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I USED THAT WORD? THAT WOULD BE A BIG STORY. HE THREW IT OUT AND NOBODY CARES. AND THEN WE HAD OUR VICE   PRESIDENT APOLOGIZE TO THEM. I LOVE MEXICO AND THE MEXICAN PEOPLE AND I HAVE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF MEXICAN PEOPLE, THOUSANDS HAVE WORKED  FOR ME. THE HISPANICS ARE PHENOMENAL   PEOPLE.  I WON THE POLL IN NEVADA. I WON NEVADA AND I WON WITH THE HISPANICS WHICH IS SO GOOD. SO GOOD.   BUT LOOK, HERE'S THE  PROBLEM, THEIR LEADERS ARE TOO SMART. WE ARE GETTING KILLED AT THE   BORDER AND TRADE. NABISCO IS MOVING IN FROM CHICAGO AND CLOSING THEIR BIG  PLANT. LOOK AT FORD, THEY ARE BUILDING  A MASSIVE CAR COMPLEX AND  CLOSING IN MICHIGAN AND OTHER  PLACES AND CLOSING AND GOING TO  MEXICO.  THE OTHER DAY, CARRIER AIR CONDITIONERS. GOOD AIR CONDITIONERS. I'M NOT BUYING THEM ANYMORE. THEY ANNOUNCED 1,400 MEN AND   WOMEN ARE BEING LAID OFF.  BIG, BIG STORY.  1,400 AND THIS MANAGER -- WELL,  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE ARE  CLOSING OUR PLANT AND MOVING TO  MEXICO.  HE WAS PRETTY TOUGH. THIS WAS NOT A GUY WITH SOCIAL   GRACE. THEY ARE GOING TO MOVE TO MEXICO.  MITT ROMNEY SAID WE HAVE TO KEEP FREE TRADE. IF WE KEEP FREE TRADE, WE AREN'T GOING TO HAVE ANY COMPANIES LEFT AT ALL.  YOU MORE -- KNOW MORE ABOUT  NAFTA BUT WE ARE GOING TO DO   SOMETHING MUCH DIFFERENT.  I BUILT A TREMENDOUS FORTUNE AND I STARTED OFF WITH VERY LITTLE.  THEY SAY MY FATHER.  IF MY FATHER WOULD HAVE GIVEN -- MY SISTER AND BROTHER CALLED ME  UP AND SAID DON, ARE THEY KIDDING. AND NOW IT'S WORTH BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF   DOLLARS. I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING. WITH THE CARRIER PLANT, WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS YOU HAVE TO BE   SMART. SO THIS ISN'T FREE TRADE.  WE HAVE TO HAVE SMART TRADE. CHINA CHARGES TREMENDOUS TARIFFS AND TAXES. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS A   MANUFACTURER. HE MAKES GREAT PRODUCT AND PUTS IT INTO CHINA AND THEY SEND IT   BACK.  THIRD TIME THEY TAKE IT BUT PAYS A TREMENDOUS TAX. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW TOUGH IT IS TO NEGOTIATE WITH CHINA. AND WHEN THEY TAKE THE PRODUCT, THEY CHARGE YOU THE TAX. CHINA WHEN THEY SELL THEIR PRODUCT. NO TAX. TAKE OUR JOBS, NO TAX, NO  NOTHING. NOT GOING TO WORK THAT WAY.  MEXICO THE SAME THING. FORD BUILDS THIS PLANT GOING TO  MAKE CARS, TRUCKS AND PARTS AND  GOING TO SEND THEM INTO OUR  COUNTRY. NO TAX.  WHERE IS THAT GOOD FOR US? WHEN I WATCH A GUY LIKE ROMNEY WHO TRULY IS A LIGHT WEIGHT. THINK OF IT. HE IS TALKING ABOUT TRADE. AND I LOVE FREE TRADE. I'M A FREE TRADER. A LOT OF THE CONSERVATIVES SAY   DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T LIKE FREE TRADE. I WANT SMART TRADE. I DON'T WANT TO BE LOSING $500   BILLION A YEAR. I DON'T WANT TO BE LOSING $58  BILLION A YEAR.  I WANT TO MAKE MONEY OR BREAK EVEN AT WORST. [CHEERS  SO I TELL PEOPLE, IF YOU HAD LIKE LIGHT WEIGHT RUBIO AS PRESIDENT, HE IS ALL CONTROLLED BY THE SPECIAL INTERESTS, 100%. REMEMBER, I'M SELF-FUNDING AND THEY AREN'T PAYING ME ANYTHING.  A GUY LIKE TED CRUZ GETTING A  LOT OF MONEY FROM OIL AND OTHER PLACES, OK. HONESTLY THAT'S THE WAY LIFE WORKS. OIL, 100%. HE'LL GET A LOBBYIST, 100%.  ME, IT'S DIFFERENT.  HERE'S WHAT THEY WILL DO IT. THEY'LL CARRY IT TO ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN. ONLY WAY WE ARE GOING TO STOP THIS TREMENDOUS OUTFLOW OF COMPANIES AND PFIZER, GREAT DRUG COMPANY LEAVING GOING TO IRELAND. WONDERFUL. BUT YOU AREN'T GOING TO TAKE   ADVANTAGE OF US. YOU AREN'T GOING TO TAKE OF US. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS. LET'S USE CARRIER. I KNOW IT'S NOT PRESIDENTIAL AND MY WIFE CALLED BEFORE AND SAID DARLING, WOULD YOU ASK PRESIDENTIAL LIKE YOU WERE THE OTHER NIGHT WHEN YOU HAD THOSE VICTORIES. I SAID, BUT I HAVE INCOMING. WHEN YOU HAVE INCOMING, YOU  CAN'T BE TOO PRESIDENTIAL. I SAID I HAVE INCOMING. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS. THEY SAID ACT PRESIDENTIAL TONIGHT. I SAID I'LL ACT PRESIDENTIAL, BUT IF SOMEBODY HITS ME, I'M GOING TO HIT THEM BACK HARDER.   IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS.  WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY WON'T DO  ANYTHING, THE LOBBYISTS WILL SAY YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO CARRIER OR F OMPRMP D. THEY HAVE BEEN LOYAL TO YOU AND  VERY GOOD. AND GOOD. THAT'S THE END OF THAT. HERE'S WHAT I DO. I CALL UP AND I WOULD LIKE TO  USE ONE OF MY GUYS. MANY OF THE GREAT BUSINESSMEN AND WOMEN ENDORSE ME.  I WOULD ANNOUNCE THEM BUT NOBODY CARES. THESE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE.  I WILL USE THE GREATEST BUSINESS PEOPLE, GREATEST NEGOTIATORS IN  THE WORLD. THIS IS SO EASY. I WANT TO DO IT MYSELF BUT IT'S SO UNPRESIDENTIAL FOR ME TO CALL UP CARRIER. I CALL UP SAY HI, I'M PRESIDENT  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE   UNITED STATES. I HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR STAY IN MEXICO AND I HOPE YOU BUILD A  BEAUTIFUL PLANT AND I WANT TO WISH YOU WELL, BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, YOU MOVED OUT.  YOU HURT 1,400 PEOPLE. THESE PEOPLE WERE DEVASTATED.  I WATCHED IT AND DID A GREAT   JOB. YOU HURT 1,400 PEOPLE AND  THERE'S NO FREE TRADE. THEIR POLITICIANS ARE SMARTER  AND STREETER AND SMART-WISE. I SAID HERE'S THE STORY, EVERY AIR CONDITIONING UNIT YOU MAKE AND EVERY SINGLE AIR   CONDITIONING UNIT YOU MAKE AND COMES INTO THE BORDER INTO THE   UNITED STATES, WE ARE GOING TO   CHARGE YOU A 35% TAX, OK?    AND THAT'S IT. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS. AS SURE AS YOU ARE STANDING  HERE.  YOU HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE   PRESIDENT. THEY CAN'T SPEAK TO ME.  I DIDN'T TAKE THEIR MONEY. HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. THEY ARE GOING TO CALL ME UP   WITHIN 24 HOURS AND SAY, MR. PRESIDENT, DO YOU HAVE ANY SECOND THOUGHTS. I SAY ABSOLUTELY NOT.  SIR, WE DECIDED TO STAY IN THE   UNITED STATES. WE'VE DECIDED -- NOW, WE CAN BE  CUTE OR SAY WE ARE COMING -- IN WASHINGTON THEY ARE PLAYING WITH ALL SORTS OF FORMULA. WHEN HIT MADE THE STATEMENT  SAYING HE WILL RUIN FREE TRADE. IF I'M LOSING $500 BILLION WITH CHINA, $58 BILLION WITH MEXICO IN TERMS OF DEFICITS, WHAT DO I  WANT THAT TRADE FOR ANY WAY. WHO NEEDS THAT KIND OF TRADE?  SERIOUSLY. WHO NEEDS THAT KIND OF TRADE. HIT ADMITTED I'M A MUCH BETTER   BUSINESSMAN THAN HIM.  I AM.  WE WILL HAVE BETTER  RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEXICO. WE WILL HAVE BETTER RELATIONSHIPS WITH CHINA.  THEY'LL RESPECT US. THEY DON'T RESPECT US NOW. THEY THINK WE ARE THE DUMBEST  PEOPLE IN THE WORLD LED BY THE   DUMBEST PEOPLE.  CHINA IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA IS BUILDING A MASSIVE MILITARY FORCE WITH RUNWAYS, TREMENDOUS COMPLEX. THEY AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THIS. THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR OUR COUNTRY. WITH ME, I'M GOING TO RIP UP   THOSE TRADE DEALS AND MAKE   REALLY GOOD ONES.  WE HAVE THE CARDS. REMEMBER, I WROTE ""THE ART OF THE DEAL,"" WHICH IS THE NUMBER ONE BUSINESS SELLING BOOK OF ALL TIME.  WE HAVE THE CARDS. WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA WITH THE   MONEY THEY HAVE TAKEN OUT OF OUR COUNTRY FOR MANY YEARS IN ALL FAIRNESS.  IT IS THE DEBATEST SINGLE THEFT IN THE WORLD. YOU GO TO CHINA, THEY HAVE TRAINS THAT GO 300 MILES AN  HOUR.  WE HAVE TRAINS THAT GO CHUG, CHUG, CHUG AND THEN HAVE TO STOP BECAUSE THE TRACK SPLIT. THEY HAVE TRAINS IN CHINA AND JAPAN. WE ARE LIKE THIRD WORLD. GO TO OUR AIRPORTS, YOU GO TO  DUBAI AND QATAR AND DIFFERENT PLACES IN ASIAN SEE AIRPORTS LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN AND COME HOME AND LAND AT KENNEDY OR L.A.X. AND LAND AT LA GUARDIA. LA GUARDIA WITH THE POTHOLES ALL OVER THE PLACE. IT IS A VERY SAD THING. WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY IS VERY, VERY, VERY SAD. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT A LOT BETTER AND MAKE IT DIFFERENT AND GET RID OF THOSE HORRIBLE TRADE DEALS. AT SOME POINT WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO LOSE $500 BILLION.  WE CAN'T CONTINUE. YOU ADD IT UP WHETHER IT'S   INDIA, VIETNAM, WHETHER IT'S   ANYBODY, EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT DEALS WITH US   TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE STUPIDITY OF THE UNITED STATES AND A LOT   OF IT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT LOBIVITIES AND NEGOTIATORS AND HIRE THE RIGHT PEOPLE ON   PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE.  AND THEY ARE NEGOTIATING WITH POLITICAL HACKS, NOT OUR BEST PEOPLE.  ALMOST OUR WORST PEOPLE. SO WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR  COUNTRY SO STRONG. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT STRONG MILITARILY.  OUR MILITARY IS VERY DEPLETED    OUR MILITARY IS VERY BADLY DEPLETED AND EVERYTHING -- THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS DEPLETED  AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR MILITARY STRONG. OUR VETS ARE TREATED HORRIBLY. HORRIBLY.  WE HAVE TO GET RID OF ORK AND REPEAL IT AND -- OBAMACARE AND   REPEAL IT AND REPLACE IT.  AND GET RID OF COMMON CORE WHICH IS A DISASTER. YOU KNOW, IN THE WORLD   EDUCATIONALLY, OF THE 30   COUNTRIES THAT THEY LOOK AT, WE  ARE NUMBER 30 IN EDUCATION,  MEANING WE ARE THE WORST. AND YET PER STUDENT COST, NUMBER ONE SO FAR, NUMBER TWO DOESN'T EXIST. WE ARE NUMBER ONE IN COSTS AND   WE ARE NUMBER 30 IN TERMS OF   SUCCESS. SO WE ARE RANKED THE WORST AND   YET WE SPEND THE MOST. AND PART OF THAT IS COMMON CORE, IT'S TERRIBLE. PART OF IT IS A LOT OF THEFT,  WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE.  BUT WE ARE GOING TO STRAIGHTEN   IT OUT.  WHEN I WON NEW HAMPSHIRE, THEY   CAME OUT WITH A REPORT, DONALD TRUMP SPENT $2.5 MILLION AND I   WON'T MENTION NAMES BUT OTHER PEOPLE SPENT $45 MILLION.  I DON'T THINK HE  LIKES ME, DO YOU AGREE?  WOULDN'T IT BE NICE -- SO I HAVE THE LOWEST EXPENDITURE BY FAR AND I HAVE THE BIGGEST RESULTS   BY FAR.  WAY, WAY NUMBER ONE. WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF WE COULD DO THAT FOR OUR COUNTRY? WE CAN DO THAT. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO.  [CHEERS  SO WE ARE SIMPLY GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH. YOU ARE GOING TO GET SO TIRED OF WINNING, YOU ARE GOING TO SAY PLEASE, LET US HAVE A COUPLE OF LOSSES.  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AND YOU'LL SAY OK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH. GO VOTE ON SATURDAY. I LOVE YOU.  THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU EVERYBODY.

WE HAVE WON FIVE MAJOR STATES. WE COULD WIN SIX OR SEVEN OR NINE. IT HAS BEEN GREAT. I CONGRATULATE TED CRUZ ON THAT WIN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I WATCHED HILLARY'S SPEECH. SHE IS TALKING ABOUT WAGES HAVE BEEN POOR. EVERYTHING IS DOING BADLY. SHE HAS BEEN THERE FOR SO LONG. IF SHE HASN'T STRAIGHTENED IT OUT BY NOW SHE IS NOT GOING TO STRAIGHTEN IT OUT IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. IT IS GOING TO BE WORSE. SHE WANTS TO MAKE AMERICA WHOLE AGAIN. WHAT IS THAT ABOUT? MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IS BETTER THAN MAKE AMERICA WHOLE AGAIN. THIS WAS AN EXCITING EVENING. IT IS GREAT TO BE IN FLORIDA. IT IS GREAT TO BE WITH FRIENDS IN THE PRESS. I KNOW IT WAS A TOUGH NIGHT FOR MARCO RUBIO. HE WORKED HARD. HE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY. HE IS A LIGHTWEIGHT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, WE ARE GOING TO GO TO FLORIDA AND SPEND SO MUCH TIME IN FLORIDA. WE HAVE A 20 POINT LEAD. A LOT OF THE SPECIAL INTERESTS AND LOBBYISTS, THE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO HAVE THEIR LITTLE SENATOR DO EXACTLY AS THEY WANT, THEY'RE GOING TO PAY $20 MILLION INTO IT OVER THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. FRANKLY I THINK THAT IS FINE AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED. IF HE WINS THEY WILL HAVE TOTAL CONTROL. HE IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE ANYWAY. WE ARE GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN FLORIDA. VIRGINIA WAS A GREAT WIN. IT IS A PLACE WE HAVE BIG INVESTMENTS. WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES AND FLORIDA. IT HAS BEEN AN AMAZING PLACE TO INVEST. IT HAS BEEN AMAZING TO HAVE SO MANY WONDERFUL EMPLOYEES, URGING US ON. THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, ALL OVER THE WORLD. IT HAS BEEN JUST SO BEAUTIFUL TO WATCH THIS COMPANY GROW AND WATCH IT GROW SO STRONGLY. RECENT ARTICLES CAME OUT TALKING ABOUT HOW GREAT A COMPANY WE BUILT. WE WANT TO PUT THAT SAME ABILITY INTO DOING SOMETHING FOR OUR NATION. OUR NATION IS IN SERIOUS TROUBLE. WE ARE BEING KILLED ON TRADE. ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED. CHINA IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF US. I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST CHINA. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR CHINA. THEIR LEADERS ARE TOO SMART FOR OUR LEADERS. THE TRADE DEFICITS AT $400 BILLION AND $500 BILLION ARE TOO MUCH. NO COUNTRY CAN SUSTAIN THAT KIND OF TRADE DEFICIT. IT WILL NOT BE THAT WAY FOR LONG. WE HAVE THE GREATEST BUSINESS LEADERS IN THE WORLD ON MY TEAM ALREADY. BELIEVE ME WE ARE GOING TO REDO THOSE TRADE DEALS. YOU LOOK AT COUNTRIES LIKE MEXICO WHERE THEY ARE KILLING US ON THE BORDER. ABSOLUTELY DESTROYING IS ON THE BORDER. THEY ARE DESTROYING US IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. CARRIER AIR-CONDITIONER MOVING INTO MEXICO. FORD MOVING TO MEXICO. NABISCO CLOSING UP SHOP IN CHICAGO AND MOVING INTO MEXICO. WE HAVE TO STOP IT. WE ARE GOING TO CREATE JOBS WE WILL CREATE JOBS LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN. WE'RE GOING TO LOWER TAXES. I HAVE A PLAN THAT SO MANY THINK IS THE BEST PLAN THEY HAVE SEEN. WE GOING TO LOWER TAXES SUBSTANTIALLY. THE MIDDLE CLASS HAS BEEN FORGOTTEN. IT WAS THE PREDOMINANT FACTOR IN MAKING OUR COUNTRY INTO A COUNTRY THAT WE LOVE SO MUCH. BUT WE FORGOTTEN THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE ARE GOING TO LOWER TAXES. WE ARE LOWERING TAXES ON BUSINESS. WHEN YOU SEE PFIZER MOVING TO IRELAND AND YOU SEE SO MANY OTHER COMPANIES CONSTANTLY LEAVING. THEY USED TO MOVE FROM NEW YORK TO FLORIDA. WILL THEY MOVE FROM NEW JERSEY TO SOMEPLACE ELSE, CHRIS. NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE LEAVING NEW JERSEY. CHRIS UNDERSTANDS THE PROBLEM. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. WE HAVE LOST MANUFACTURING JOBS. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF JOBS, THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PLANTS. MANUFACTURING PLANTS, WAREHOUSES. WE ARE LOSING SO MUCH WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN. I TELL THE STORY ABOUT A FRIEND OF MINE WHO WAS IN THE EXCAVATION BUSINESS. HE ALWAYS ORDERS CATERPILLAR. HE ORDERED TRACTORS FROM JAPAN BECAUSE THEY HAVE CUT THE END. THEY HAVE DEVALUED THE YEN. I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THEY SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO IT. WE HAVE TREMENDOUS POWER. WE ARE THE SOURCE. WE HAVE GREAT POWER. WE HAVE POLITICIANS WHO TRULY, TRULY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. WE ARE GOING TO WORK HARD.   I AM SO HONORED BY THIS. I WAS WITH MY WIFE, IT LOOKS LITERALLY LIKE THIS. YOU HAVE A LOT OF CAMERAS HERE TONIGHT. IT LOOKS LITERALLY LIKE THE ACADEMY AWARDS. I NEVER SAW SO MANY CAMERAS IN MY LIFE. IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I HAVE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE. I HAVE BEEN A JOB PRODUCER. I HAVE DONE A LOT OF THINGS. THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE NEVER DONE. AND YOU LOOK THE INCOME WHEN -- BUT I FELT WE HAD TO DO IT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INCOMPETENCE OF THE KORAN DEAL WHERE -- THE IRAN DEAL, WHERE WE GET ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE PROBLEMS OUR COUNTRY HAS, YOU LOOK AT OUR MILITARY WHICH IS BEING DEPLETED RAPIDLY, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR MILITARY BIGGER AND BETTER AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE AND NOBODY, NOBODY IS GOING TO MESS WITH US, FOLKS, NOBODY.   SO -- SO IT IS AN AMAZING HONOR TO HAVE YOU WITH ME TONIGHT. IT WILL BE OK IF YOU WANT ASK QUESTIONS.   WELL, THEY CAN ALWAYS DO THAT. THEN THEY WILL JUST LOSE EVERYTHING. THEN IT WILL JUST BE THE WORK OF A LOSER. LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING. IF YOU HAVE  SEEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED, WHERE WE HAD A TREMENDOUS VICTORY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, TREMENDOUS IN NEVADA, YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND TONIGHT IS THE BEST OF ALL. RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE PROJECTED 6. BUT IT COULD BE 7, 8, 9, MAJOR STATES, GEORGIA, MASSACHUSETTS, --    TENNESSEE, VIRGINIA. THESE ARE AMAZING STATES. WE ARE GOING TO PROBABLY GET A LOT MORE. IN FACT WE ARE PROJECTED TO HAVE , GOOD ADDITIONAL NUMBERS. I WILL SAY THIS. LOOK, WE HAVE EXPANDED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND YOU SEE THE KIND OF NUMBERS WE HAVE IN TERMS OF EXTRA PEOPLE COMING IN. THEY CAME FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE DEMOCRATS. THEY WERE LONG-TERM DEMOCRATS. THEY WERE NEVER GOING TO SWITCH AND THEY ALL SWITCHED. AND THE ALL SWITCHED. THEY WERE INDEPENDENTS. WE HAVE EXPANDED THE PARTY. LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF VOTES IN THAT AREA AS AN EXAMPLE. FOUR YEARS AGO THEY HAD 390 THOUSAND VOTES. WE DOUBLED IT. WE WERE ALMOST 800,000 VOTES. THE DEMOCRATS WENT DOWN. THERE IS MUCH LESS ENTHUSIASM. I AM A UNIFIER. I KNOW PEOPLE WILL FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE. I AM A UNIFIER. ONCE WE GET THIS FINISHED I'M GOING TO GO AFTER ONE PERSON, HILLARY CLINTON ON THE ASSUMPTION SHE IS ALLOWED TO RUN WHICH IS A BIG ASSUMPTION.   I DON'T KNOW SHE IS GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO RUN. THAT IS GOING TO BE AN EASY RACE. I BEAT HILLARY IN MANY POLLS. I DON'T THINK MARCO IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO BEAT HER. I THINK TED IS GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME. TED CRUZ HAS A SHOT BECAUSE AT LEAST HE HAS ONE A LITTLE BIT. WE ARE GOING TO BE A MUCH FINER PARTY. A MUCH -- A UNIFIED PARTY. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. WE ARE GOING TO BE A MUCH BIGGER PARTY. OUR PARTY IS EXPANDING. LOOK AT THE PRIMARY STATES WERE I HAVE ONE. THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN MANY, MANY DECADES. SO, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE, MORE UNIFIED, A MUCH BIGGER PARTY, AND I THINK WE GOING TO WIN IN NOVEMBER.   OK, YEAH?  MR. TRUMP CALLING I AM JUST DOING  I AM JUST DOING WHAT IS RIGHT. PLANNED PARENTHOOD HAS DONE GOOD WORK. I WILL SAY IT. I AM A CONSERVATIVE. I'M A COMMONSENSE CONSERVATIVE. MILLIONS OF WOMEN HAVE BEEN HELPED BY PLANNED PARENTHOOD. WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW AND FUND AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE ABORTION GOING ON AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD. WE UNDERSTAND THAT. I HAVE SAID IT LOUD AND CLEAR. AND, WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. PLANNED PARENTHOOD, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WRITING LETTERS. -- THOUSANDS OF LETTERS OF WOMEN THAT HAVE BEEN HELPED. THIS WAS NOT A SET-UP. I AM GOING TO BE GOOD FOR WOMEN. I AM GOING TO BE GOOD FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. MAYBE THAT IS NOT A PERFECT CONSERVATIVE VIEW. BUT I CAN TELL YOU I AM MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN ANYBODY ON THE MILITARY, TAKING CARE OF OUR VETERANS, ON THE BORDER ON THE WALL, ON GETTING RID OF OBAMA CARE AND COMING UP WITH SOMETHING MUCH, MUCH BETTER. AND CERTAINLY GETTING RID OF COMMON CORE AND BRINGING EDUCATION TO A LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT YOU HAVE GOOD EDUCATION FOR OUR CHILDREN. WHO ARE BEING ABSOLUTELY STARVED FOR PROPER EDUCATION. SO, I MEAN, YOU CAN CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT. BUT I AM A TRUTH TELLER. AND, I WILL TELL THE TRUTH. OK? GO AHEAD. FINISH IT. I FEEL AWFULLY GOOD. I'M WATCHING YOUR PEOPLE. I'M GOING TO BE VERY NICE. I'M WATCHING YOUR PEOPLE ON CNN. I'M WATCHING THE MSNBC PEOPLE. AND I AM WATCHING THE FOX PEOPLE. OK, SEE? I'M BECOMING DIPLOMATIC. AND THEY ARE CERTAINLY BEING VERY NICE TO ME TONIGHT. YOU KNOW, THEY ARE BEING VERY STRONG. AND, THEY ARE DECLARING MARCO RUBIO THE BIG LOSER OF THE NIGHT. HE HASN'T WON ANYTHING. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, HE WAS VERY NASTY. HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE NASTY. HE HAS NOT WON ANYTHING. AND HE IS NOT GOING TO BE VERY NICE. I DO CONGRATULATE TED CRUZ. I KNOW HOW HARD TED CRUZ HAS WORKED ON TEXAS. THAT IS A BIG GET. I DID VERY WELL IN TEXAS. I CAME IN SECOND. ONE OF THE THINGS MY SON TOLD ME WHICH I DIDN'T REALIZE IS THAT NOT ONLY DO I WIN MOST OF THE STATES, SOME ARE COMING IN, I CAME IN SECOND, NO WORST THAN SECOND. SO, IT WASN'T LIKE I WON AND THEN I DISAPPEARED. THE WORST I HAD WAS A SECOND. SO I AM VERY HONORED BY THE TURNOUT. OK, YES, GO AHEAD.   RIGHT, RIGHT. OH, THEY ARE TOTALLY WRONG. I DISAVOWED. CHRIS IS MY -- HE GAVE ME THE HONOR OF JOINING THE CAMPAIGN. HE CALLED ME, HE SAID, NOW WHAT YOU HAVE IS A MOVEMENT. WE SPOKE. TODAY IN KENTUCKY. YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY HAD. THERE HAD TO BE 20,000 PEOPLE INSIDE THIS MASSIVE CONVENTION CENTER. EVERY PLACE WE ARE THINKING. IF WE HAVE 10,000 PEOPLE IT IS A SMALL GROUP. WHEN CHRIS CALLED HE SAID THIS IS A MOVEMENT. THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW. WHEN CHRIS JOINED WE HAD A NEWS CONFERENCE. AND THEY ASKED ME THE EXACT SAME QUESTION. AND I SAID, I DISAVOW. NOW, RIGHT AFTER THE PROGRAM WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, WE ARE GROUPS, GROUPS. WHO KNOWS. I MEAN, THEY HAVE TO GIVE ME THE NAME OF THE GROUP. BUT RIGHT AFTER, I PUT OUT A TWEET AND I PUT ON FACEBOOK THAT I  TOTALLY DISAVOWED. I DISAVOWED THEM. I DISAVOWED THEN, I DISAVOWED TODAY WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS ON ABC. I DISAVOWED IT TODAY. BUT, I DISAVOWED AND I HOPE IT IS THE FINAL TIME I HAVE TO DO IT. BUT, IF YOU LOOK AT FACEBOOK AND TWITTER I PUT OUT A STATEMENT BECAUSE I WANTED EVERYONE TO BE SURE.   NO, IT IS NOT. BUT THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME NEGOTIATION. AND IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD , NEGOTIATION. NOT A BAD NEGOTIATION. HOPEFULLY I WILL MAKE A GREAT DEAL AND LOTS OF GREAT DEALS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOW LOOK, YOU CANNOT GO AROUND JUST SIGNING NOTICES THE PRESIDENT SIGNS ALL THE TIME, EXECUTIVE ORDERS. HE IS LIKE, EXECUTIVE ORDER, EXECUTIVE ORDER. I DON'T KNOW, DOES HE DEAL WITH CONGRESS ANYMORE? DOES HE SPEAK WITH CONGRESSMAN AND GET THEM IN A ROOM AND GET THINGS DONE? A GOOD EXAMPLE IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO ME. CORPORATE INVERSION. CARL ICAHN, A GREAT BUSINESSMAN WHO ENDORSES ME, I TALKED TO HIM ABOUT WHERE WE ARE LOSING COMPANIES. THE TAXES ARE TOO HIGH. WE HAVE THE HIGHEST TAXED NATION IN THE WORLD. AND VERY IMPORTANTLY THEY HAVE TRILLIONS, TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUTSIDE OF THIS COUNTRY. THE DEMOCRATS AGREE IT SHOULD BE BROUGHT BACK IN. THE REPUBLICANS AGREE IT SHOULD BE BROUGHT BACK IN. EVERYONE AGREES IT SHOULD BE BROUGHT BACK IN. I COULD SIT IN A ROOM OR THE OVAL OFFICE FOR LITERALLY HALF HOUR AND I BELIEVE I COULD GET EVERYBODY, EVERY SINGLE PERSON. IT IS ONE THING IF THEY DO NOT AGREE ON HEALTH CORE -- ON HEALTH CARE OR COMMON CORE OR OTHER THINGS. HERE'S ONE THING WHERE EVERYBODY WERE ALMOST EVERYBODY AGREES. THESE TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS SHOULD BE BROUGHT INTO THE COUNTRY HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE A DEAL. HE PROBABLY DOES NOT WORK AT IT. HE PROBABLY DOESN'T CARE. YOU ARE TALKING TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY. SO, WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY WANTS AND YOU CANNOT MAKE A DEAL, THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON THAT IS WRONG. YOU HAVE THE WRONG LEADER.   WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A WALL. I CAN TELL YOU. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A WALL. I WATCHED THE EX-PRESIDENT OF MEXICO. THE ARROGANCE OF THIS MAN. I GET ALONG WITH HISPANICS. YOU SAW IN NEVADA, I WON IN THE POLL, THE HISPANIC VOTE. I HAVE THOUSANDS WHO WORK FOR ME RIGHT NOW THAT ARE HISPANIC. I'VE HAD THOUSANDS OF THOUSANDS OVER MY LIFETIME. THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. THE MEXICAN LEADERS ARE TOO SMART FOR OUR LEADERS. YOU SAW IT. FIRST OF ALL, VINCENT FOX, NO ONE EVEN TALKED ABOUT THE WORD HE USED. HE WAS ANGRY AT THE CONCEPT OF SOMEBODY SAYING THEY WERE GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL. MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL. WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT WITH MEXICO. $58 BILLION. THE WALL IS GOING TO COST $10 BILLION. IT IS SO EASY. I HAVE HAD THESE GUYS THAT I AM ON THE STAGE WITH COME UP AND SAY, YOU DON'T REALLY MEAN MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL. AS SURE AS YOU ARE STANDING THERE, 100% MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY.   THE REASON IS I'M A BUSINESSMAN. I KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. POLITICIANS ARE ALL TALK. NO ACTION. EXCEPT FOR CHRIS CHRISTIE, OF COURSE. IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. WHEN YOU THINK OF THAT, AND THEY SAY YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO BUILD A WALL, IT IS 2000 MILES BUT WE NEED 1000 MILES. THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA IS 13,000 MILES, FOLKS. BILL 2000 YEARS AGO. AND, THEY DIDN'T HAVE CATERPILLAR TRACTORS. I LOVE JOHN DEERE. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TRACTORS. THEY DIDN'T HAVE CRANES. THEY DIDN'T HAVE EXCAVATION EQUIPMENT. THE WALL IS 13,000 MILES LONG. WE HAVE ALL OF THE MATERIALS. THIS IS GOING TO BE A SERIOUS WALL. THIS IS GOING TO BE A HIGH WALL. THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY SERIOUS WALL. WE ARE GOING TO STOP DRUGS FROM COMING INTO NEW HAMPSHIRE. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WENT TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, THOSE PEOPLE WERE SO WONDERFUL TO ME. WHEN YOU GO TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL, IT IS SO BUCOLIC. AND YET, WHEN YOU GO TO A MEETING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEM, HEROIN IS POURING IN. THEY HAVE SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AND OTHER PEOPLE ADDICTED. I TOLD THEM I'M GOING TO STOP IT. I'M GOING TO STOP IT. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A STRONG. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A STRONG BORDER. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME INTO THIS COUNTRY, BUT THEY ARE GOING TO COME IN LEGALLY.  HE IS A FRIEND OF MINE AND I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR RICK SCOTT.   WE HAVE A BIG PROBLEM.   WE HAVE A BIG, BIG PROBLEM. I WILL TELL IT LIKE IT IS. WE HAVE A BIG, BIG PROBLEM. WE HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT. RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM, BIG PROBLEM. NOT ONLY FOR US. YOU TAKE A LOOK AT GERMANY, SWEDEN, BRUSSELS. YOU LOOK AT THESE PLACES. IT IS LIKE A DISASTER. AND, WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY, WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY COME FROM. THEY HAVE NO PAPERWORK. THEY ARE YOUNG AND THEY ARE STRONG. YOU LOOK AT THAT MIGRATION LINE. THEY ARE YOUNG, THEY ARE STRONG, THEY ARE POWERFUL. AND YOU SAY, WHY AREN'T THEY BACK FIGHTING FOR THEIR COUNTRY? WITH THAT BEING SAID I FEEL STRONG. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A SAFE ZONE IN SYRIA. AND WHEN TO GET THE GULF STATES WHO HAVE MORE MONEY THAN ANYBODY. WE HAVE TO LOOSEN THEIR WALLETS. THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTING PEOPLE. BUT WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WE ARE GOING TO GET THE GULF STATES TO PAY FOR IT. AND THEY SHOULD. YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID. I GAVE YOU A GOOD ANSWER. GO AHEAD.   YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.  WE ARE GOING TO BRING THEM BACK. WE ARE GOING TO DO GREAT WITH THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN. YOU SEE THAT IN THE POLLS, ONE POLL I AM 25%. AND ONE OF THE COMMENTATORS, WHO I THINK IS STANDING IN THE BACK OF THE CORNER SAID, IF DONALD TRUMP GETS 25% OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE, THIS ELECTION IS OVER. YOU WATCH. THE REASON I AM GETTING THAT AND I WILL DO GREAT WITH HISPANICS AND VIRTUALLY EVERY GROUP. THE REASON, I AM GOING TO BRING JOBS BACK. I WILL HAVE APPLE BUILD OF THEIR COMPUTERS AND IPHONES ON OUR LAND, NOT IN CHINA. HOW DOES IT HELP US WHEN WE MAKE IT IN CHINA?   LOOK, I'LL WAS LIKED MARCO UNTIL ABOUT A WEEK AGO WHEN HE WENT HOSTILE. HE DECIDED TO BECOME A DON RICKLES. BUT DON RICKLES HAS A LOT MORE TALENT. HONESTLY, I DID. HE IS LOSING VERY BADLY. SOMEONE TOLD HIM, THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN POSSIBLY WIN, TAKE THE HAIL MARY, IT HAS HURT HIM. IN FACT, ONE OF THE NEWSCAST SAID HE WENT DOWN 15% OR 20%. IT HAS REALLY HURT HIM. BUT LOOK, I AM NOT GOING TO TELL HIM WHAT TO DO. I AM NOT GOING TO TELL ANYBODY WHAT TO DO. HE HAD A BAD NIGHT. ACCORDING TO CNN, FOX. I WATCHED THEIR BROADCAST. THEY SAID OF THE LOSER OF THE NIGHT WAS MARCO RUBIO. HE HAS NOT WON ANYTHING. AT LEAST YOU CAN SAY THAT TED HAS WON SOMETHING. MARCO HAS NOT WON. YOU GOT TO BE ABLE TO WIN, YOU CANNOT TALK. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO WIN SOMETHING. HE ACTUALLY HAS NOT COME VERY CLOSE. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. YES, GO AHEAD.  I WAS NOT EQUIVOCATING. LET'S NOT SAY IT AGAIN, WHO ARE YOU? GOOD JOB. WHO ARE YOU? WHO ARE YOU WITH? LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO WASTE A LOT OF TIME. I AM GOING TO GET ALONG GREAT WITH CONGRESS. PAUL RYAN, I DO NOT KNOW HIM WELL, BUT I'M SURE WE WILL GET ALONG. AND IF WE DON'T, HE WILL HAVE TO PAY A BIG PRICE, OK? OK.  GO AHEAD, ON THE RIGHT. OK, YES?  I AM GOING TO BE A BIG, GOOD PRESIDENT. BUT LOOK. WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT IS IN BIG TROUBLE. OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO HELL,  OUR HOSPITALS AND AIRPORTS -- I GO THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. YOU GO TO QATAR, YOU GO TO SO MANY PLACES, IN CHINA, ASIA, DIFFERENT PLACES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE AIRPORTS THEY HAVE, THE ROADWAYS THEY HAVE, THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS THEY HAVE AND THE TRAINS. WE ARE LIKE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY. SO I AM GOING TO BE VERY GOOD FOR THE WORLD AND GET ALONG WITH THE WORLD. YOU ARE GOING TO BE VERY PROUD OF ME, EVEN YOU WILL BE VERY PROUD OF ME AS A PRESIDENT. BUT, WE HAVE TO REBUILD OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO HELL. AND HILLARY CLINTON DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE. SHE CAN'T DO THAT. SHE IS TALKING ABOUT -- YOU KNOW, ONE THING THAT REALLY BOTHERED ME, THE REASON I HAVE SUCH GREAT SUPPORT, IS THAT PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE INCOME GROUPS ARE MAKING LESS MONEY TODAY THAN THEY MADE 12 YEARS AGO. AND IN HER SPEECH SHE JUST SAID THEY ARE MAKING LESS MONEY, SHE HAS BEEN THERE WITH OBAMA FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. WHY HAVEN'T THEY DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT? THEN YOU LOOK AT HER RECORD AS SECRETARY OF STATE, IT IS ABYSMAL. YOU LOOK AT WHAT GOES ON WITH SYRIA. YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH EVERYTHING. IT IS A DISASTER. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN INTERESTING PERIOD OF TIME. I DO NOT KNOW IF SHE IS GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO RUN. WHAT SHE DID WAS A CRIMINAL ACT. IF SHE IS ALLOWED TO RUN I WILL BE SURPRISED. BUT IF SHE IS ALLOWED TO RUN, IT WILL BE A SAD DAY FOR THIS COUNTRY. BECAUSE WHAT SHE DID WAS WRONG. AND WHAT SHE DID, LET ME JUST TELL YOU --    WHAT SHE DID WAS WRONG, AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE FAR WORSE THAN HER AND PAID -- FAR LESS THEY ON HER AND THEY PAID A VERY, VERY BIG PRICE. OK, ONE OR TWO MORE QUESTIONS.  WHERE DID I SAY THAT? WHERE? WHERE? I DID NOT SAY THAT. YES, I WILL TAKE TWO FEET OFF THE WALL. YOU DID NOT LISTEN, JEREMY.  AT THIS MOMENT, ABSOLUTELY NOT. NO. WE EITHER HAVE A COUNTRY OR WE DO NOT. WE HAVE BORDERS OR WE DO NOT. AND AT THIS MOMENT, THE ANSWER IS, ABSOLUTELY NOT.   ONE OR TWO MORE QUESTIONS.  I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT DAVID -- OK, GO AHEAD.  WELL, LOOK, I DO NOT EXPECT -- I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT. I LIKE THE RNC, I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE BEEN TREATED FAIRLY OR NOT. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT I DO RESPECT HIM. WHAT I DO HAVE IS A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE. I HAVE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. WHEN I WAS WATCHING THOSE OF BROADCASTS JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO BEFORE I CAME IN HERE BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE EXACTLY WHERE WE WERE BEFORE HE STARTED SPEAKING. I WAS AMAZED AT THE NUMBERS. REPUBLICANS HAVE ENORMOUS ENERGY, THE DEMOCRATS DON'T. THERE ARE NUMBERS ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. PEOPLE ARE MAKING STATEMENTS THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN IN MODERN TIMES, A PARTY THAT WAS SO ENERGIZED. I THINK IF SOMEONE IS DOING AS WELL AS I AM DOING, AND I AM NOT JUST SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, BUT IF IT WAS ME OR ANYONE ELSE. IF I AM GOING TO WIN 5 -- I ALREADY WON 5 -- IT COULD BE NINE. I COULD WIN NINE STATES TONIGHT. IF I'M GOING TO WIN ALL OF THESE STATES AND AT WORST, SECOND, IT IS AWFULLY HARD TO SAY THAT IS NOT THE PERSON WE WANT TO LEAD THE PARTY. YOU KNOW, IT IS VERY HARD. IT I THINK IT IS A GOING QUESTION -- A GREAT QUESTION, DAVID, BECAUSE I REALLY THINK THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS EVERYONE IT SEES HAPPENING, IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS BECOME MORE DYNAMIC AND DIVERSE. WE ARE TAKING FROM THE DEMOCRATS AND THE INDEPENDENTS. WE HAVE A LOT MORE PEOPLE. WE HAVE A LOT MORE PEOPLE. I MEAN, TAKE A LOOK AT SOUTH CAROLINA. LOOK AT THE NUMBERS FROM FOUR YEARS AGO. THEN -- I WAS THERE, YOU HAD LINES A MILE LONG. IT VIRTUALLY MORE THAN DOUBLED. WE HAVE A VERY, VERY DYNAMIC PARTY. AND I THINK WE WILL BE ABLE TO UNIFY THE PARTY. I THINK WE WILL GET ALONG WITH EVERYBODY. I DON'T KNOW PAUL RYAN WELL, BUT I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO GET ALONG WITH HIM. I DO KNOW MITCH MCCONNELL A LITTLE BIT. BUT I HOPE TO THE ABLE TO GET ALONG WITH HIM. REMEMBER THIS, I HAVE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. THIS IS NOT A CLOSE MATCH. IT IS TOO BAD WINNER DID NOT TAKE ALL, BECAUSE THIS THING WOULD BE OVER, AND WE WOULD HAVE A CELEBRATION.  YOU KNOW, WE ARE HAVING A CELEBRATION. SO ANYWAY, I JUST WANT TO -- LOOK, I WANT TO END BY THANKING EVERYONE. THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING PERIOD IN MY LIFE. AND YOU KNOW MY DAUGHTER WILL BE HAVING A BABY VERY SOON. SHE IS A SPECIAL PERSON. THAT COULD CERTAINLY BE WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK. THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING PERIOD OF TIME, EVEN FROM AN EDUCIONAL STANDPOINT. AND I THINK HONESTLY, WE HAVE DONE SOMETHING THAT ALMOST NOBODY THOUGHT COULD BE DONE. AND I AM VERY PROUD. I JUST WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THIS. I AM A UNIFIER, I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND EVERYBODY GET TOGETHER AND UNIFY. WHEN WE UNIFY, THERE IS NOBODY THAT IS GOING TO BEAT US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYBODY.   THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THANK YOU. ",Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Super Tuesday News Conference

MR. TRUMP WAS ENDORSED BY NASCAR'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND SEVERAL NASCAR DRIVERS LEADING INTO THE GOP SUPER TUESDAY CONTEST. MR. TRUMP: YOU PEOPLE ARE AMAZING. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE GEORGIA. SO HERE IS THE STORY. WE HAVE 7005 HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE ROOM. OUTSIDE, WE HAVE 12,000 PEOPLE.   WE SET UP THE SPEAKERS. WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO GIVE SOME OF THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE YOUR POSITION? PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND. I'M ONLY KIDDING. WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD NEWS TODAY. CNN JUST CAME OUT WITH A POLL. TRUMP, 49%.   A RUBIO, 16%. TED CRUZ, 15%. BEN CARSON, 10% AND JOHN KASICH, 6%. WE ARE AT 49%, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?   WE GOT THE ENDORSEMENT OF SENATOR SESSIONS. AND WE HAVE SARAH PALIN AND SO MANY INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. JERRY FALWELL JUNIOR. WE ARE WINNING EVERY LEVEL WITH EVANGELICALS. MAYBE THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE'VE HAD SUCH HELP WHAT THE EVANGELICALS, THE TEA PARTY PEOPLE, WE ARE WINNING WITH OLD, YOUNG, HIGHLY EDUCATED.   WE ARE WINNING WITH A LITTLE LESS THAN HIGHLY EDUCATED , WHICH IS OK. AND WE'RE WINNING WITH THE VETERANS. WE'RE WINNING WITH THE MILITARY.  >> WE ARE MOURNING WITH EVERYBODY. -- WE ARE WINNING WITH EVERYBODY. IT HAS BEEN SO MUCH FUN. I HAVE A SPECIAL TREAT. I LOVE NASCAR. DO WE LOVE NASCAR? WE HAD AN ENDORSEMENT A LITTLE WHILE AGO AND MY SON IS VERY FRIENDLY WITH THE FOLKS AND NASCAR. HOW GOOD IS BRIAN FRANCE? I'VE GROWN UP AND HONESTLY, BRIAN FRANCE, THERE'S NO ONE LIKE THIS MAN. AND THE FAMILY IS SO INCREDIBLE. SOME OF THE NASCAR FOLKS CAME OVER HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?   IF THE PEOPLE THAT LIKE AND WATCH NASCAR VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP, THEY CAN CANCEL THE ELECTION RIGHT NOW. NOBODY CAN WIN.   I WILL BRING THEM UP INDIVIDUALLY BUT THE OWNER OF THE WHOLE DEAL, THE BIG GUY, BRIAN FRANCE. COME ON UP.   HE'S GETTING PRETTY DAPPER. BRIAN, WE LOVE YOU. DO YOU WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS?  ONE OF THE GREAT DRIVERS OF THE WORLD IN HISTORY, THE GREAT BILL ELLIOTT. COME ON, BILL.   WE LOVE BILL.  DO THESE GUYS HAVE GUTS. I WANT TO GO ABOUT 60, THAT'S ENOUGH. WE HAVE RYAN NEWMAN. RYAN.  COME ON UP HERE, RYAN.  WE HAVE DAVID REAGAN. DAVID, COME IN. AND BILL AND HIS INCREDIBLE WIFE HAD A SON. AND THE SUN -- WILL YOU BE UPSET IF HE TURNS OUT GREATER THAN YOU? HE'S GOING TO BE THRILLED. THAT'S A GOOD FATHER. CHASE ELLIOTT. THE HOTTEST YOUNG DRIVER IN THE WORLD.   THEY JUST SAID KEEP THE WALL GOING. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP THE WALL GOING, BELIEVE ME. IT HAS BEEN AN AMAZING TIME. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS JUST INCREDIBLE. THESE ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE, INCREDIBLE ATHLETES. IN THE JOB BRIAN HAS DONE IS LEGENDARY. I JUST COULD NOT BE HAPPY OR THAT WE ARE HERE. I JUST WANT TO DISCUSS A FEW OF THE THINGS. TOMORROW IS A REALLY BIG DAY. WE HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE. YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY. I DON'T EVEN WANT BRIAN'S MONEY. BRIAN IS GOOD FOR SOME MONEY BUT I DON'T WANT RYAN'S MONEY. I WANT EVERYBODY. TALKING ABOUT A MOVEMENT. I SAID WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. WHERE IS DAVID? HE DID SUCH AN AMAZING STORY AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT A MOVEMENT. THIS IS NOT LIKE ME. THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME, IT'S ABOUT ALL OF US. I'M JUST THE MESSENGER. THEY HAD SAID I'VE GONE CALLS FROM A LOT OF THE BIGGEST WRITERS. THEY ARE TERRIBLE. 20% OF THEM ARE GOOD. 80% ARE BAD. 40% ARE DISGUSTING. I WILL TELL YOU ONE MORE TIME, WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE WALL AND NOT GETTING RIPPED OFF IN TRADE AND TAKING CARE OF OUR VETERANS.   THAT MEANS NOBODY WILL SAY I GAVE YOU A CONTRIBUTION AND YOU HAVE TO HELP ME WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY OR YOU HAVE TO HELP ME WITH SOMETHING. YOU KNOW IN BIDDING, WE ARE THE LARGEST PURCHASER OF DRUGS IN THE WORLD. I MEAN DRUGS LIKE TO MAKE YOU BETTER. IF YOU GO TO GET SOME DRUGS THAT ARE LOCAL PHARMACY, THE GOVERNMENT IS PAYING A SIMILAR AMOUNT OF MONEY. WE WOULD SAY BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ALL OF THESE GUYS I'M RUNNING AGAINST ARE ALL TAKING CARE OF BY THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY, BY ALL THE INDUSTRIES. IT'S A BAD SYSTEM  WE COULD SAVE AS MUCH AS $300 BILLION. THAT GETS TO BE BIG MONEY. THE NUMBERS OF FRAUD, WASTE AND ABUSE IN THE SYSTEM ARE INCREDIBLE. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF SOCIAL SECURITY. NOT CURRENTLY ARE GETTING. WE'RE GOING TO CUT THE WASTE AND FRAUD AND ABUSE. WE WILL SAVE YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY WITHOUT CUTS. MARK MY WORDS.  I DEAL WITH THESE PEOPLE. I'VE MET WITH POLITICIANS ALL MY LIFE. I HAVE GOTTEN ZONE CHANGES. DOING A HUNDRED AND 14 PROJECTS ALL OVER THE WORLD. I HAVE DEALT WITH POLITICIANS. WORLDWIDE. THEY WILL NEVER GET YOU TO THE PROMISE LAND. THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO DO IT. THIS LITTLE MARCO RUBIO. I CALL HIM LIGHTWEIGHT. YOU SAW CHRIS CHRISTIE ENDORSED ME THE OTHER DAY OR AT? TOUGH GUY. THE DEBATES ARE BRUTAL. IT'S ENOUGH. WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE COMING UP ON THURSDAY. THE LAST ONE I WAS DOUBLE TEAMED AND I STILL WANT EVERY SINGLE POLL. ONE EVERY SINGLE POLL. I SEE THE BACKSTAGE. THEN BACKSTAGE. I HAVE BEEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THESE DEBATES FROM THE BEGINNING. THAT IS THE ONE WHO IS WINNING. RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. I'M STANDING THERE THEY ARE BOTH BEHIND ME SHAKING HANDS LIKE HIS OF THIS WONDERFUL. EVERY SINGLE POLL. DRUDGE IS AN INCREDIBLE GUY. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN NUMBER ONE WITH ALL THE CRAZY DEBATING. I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE. I'M NOT A POLITICIAN. ALL THESE GUYS DO IS TALK. THEY DEBATE, THEY TALK, NOTHING GETS DONE. THEY GO TO GET CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. I AM SO CONVINCED THAT OUR COUNTRY CAN BE GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. THAT'S WHY I'M DOING THIS. GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. I DO A LOT OF BUSINESS WITH THE CHINESE. I HAVE THE BANK OF AMERICA BUILDING BECAUSE THE CHINESE. I HAVE 12 NINETY AVE OF THE AMERICAS, 6TH AVENUE IN NEW YORK. A MASSIVE BUILDING. THE LARGEST BANK IN THE WORLD, 400 MILLION CUSTOMERS, THEY ARE A TENANT IN ONE OF MY BUILDINGS IN MANHATTAN. DEALING WITH THE CHINESE IS FINE. THEIR LEADERS ARE TOO SMART FOR OUR LEADERS. THEY ARE KILLING US FOLKS. CARL ICAHN IS ONE OF THE GREAT BUSINESS PEOPLE. I HAVE THE GREATEST NEGOTIATORS IN THE WORLD. WE USE POLITICAL HACKS TO NEGOTIATE THESE HUGE TRADE DEALS. BIGGER THAN ANY JAIL. WE LOSE EVERY YEAR WITH CHINA. $500 BILLION. THIS IS GOING ON FOREVER. WE ALWAYS LOSE. WE GOT TO START WINNING.  THESE POLITICAL GUYS ARE IN THERE BECAUSE THEY GAVE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS OR WHATEVER. MEL IS HERE BUT I YOU HIS LAST NAME. HE RAISES A LOT OF MONEY FOR POLITICIANS. HE SAID CAN I RAISE MONEY FOR YOU? YEAH HOW MUCH MONEY I TURNED DOWN? I WOULD'VE MADE JEB BUSH IS $148 MILLION, I WOULD HAVE MADE THAT LOOK LIKE PEANUTS. I TURNED DOWN MONEY AFTER MONEY. IT'S NOT MY LIFE. MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN MONEY. I WAS GREEDY. I WANT MORE MONEY. NOW THEY COME UP AND THEY WANT TO GIVE ME MONEY. I SAY I DON'T WANT IT. NOW I AM GOING TO BE GREEDY FOR THE UNITED STATES. I'M GOING TO TAKE, TAKE, TAKE.  WE'RE GOING TO BECOME RICH AGAIN. WE WILL BECOME GREAT AGAIN. A WONDERFUL WOMAN CAME UP TO ME. SHE SAID I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR YOU. BUT PLEASE DON'T SAY YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE US RICH AGAIN. THAT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD. IT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. WE CAN'T BE GREAT AND LEST WE MAKE OURSELVES RICH AGAIN. WE HAVE TO MAKE OURSELVES RICH. WE ARE LOSING ALL OF OUR JOBS TO CHINA TO JAPAN. THE CARS COMING IN BY THE MILLIONS. IN LOS ANGELES THEY HAVE THE LARGEST SHIPS YOU'VE EVER SEEN WITH CARS. IT LOOKED LIKE A NASCAR TRACK. I'M NOT SURE CHASE COULD DRIVE THE CAR AS FAST AS THESE GUYS DRIVE OFF THE SHIP. THEY COME OFF LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. WE GET NOTHING. WE GIVE THEM BEEF. IT IS A TINY FRACTION. TALK ABOUT A TRADE IMBALANCE. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO WITH THE BEEF, THEY SENT THE VOTES BACK. THEY DON'T EVEN TAKE IT. THEY SENT IT BACK AGAIN. BY THAT TIME IT IS ALL ROTTED. THEY SELL IT AS KOBE BEEF AND THEY CHARGE YOU 10 TIMES MORE. THE IMBALANCE THAT WE HAVE. EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT THE WALL. THE WALL IS GOING TO BE BUILT FOLKS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A STRONG BORDER.  WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL?  THE INCENSE A FOX WAS ON TV THE OTHER DAY THROWING OUT THE F BOMB. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I DID THAT? I WOULD BE UP HERE TONIGHT. HE'S SAYING THERE IS NO WAY WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THE YOU KNOW WHAT WALL. I WATCHED THE ANGER. YOU KNOW WHY HE'S ANGRY? NOBODY HAS EVER TOLD THEM NO. NOBODY EVER TELLS HIM NO. HE CAN'T BELIEVE IT. A GUY NAMED TRUMP. HE EVEN GOT THE POPE AFTER MAY. THE POPE WAS AFTER MAY. ME. I LOVE NEVADA. I LOVE SOUTH CAROLINA. I LOVE NEW HAMPSHIRE. I PROMISE TO THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE WE WILL STOP THE HEROINE FROM FLOWING INTO THIS COUNTRY. THEY HAVE SUCH A PROBLEM. WE ARE GOING TO STOP IT. HERE'S THE STORY. WE ARE READY TO VOTE IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND I AM DOING GREAT. MY PEOPLE, AND SAY THE POPE, THAT HIS BIG-LEAGUE LET'S FACE IT. IS THAT BIGGER THAN BRIAN FRANCE, I'M NOT SURE. THAT JUST MADE A BIG STATEMENT ABOUT YOU. THIS IS LIKE EIGHT HOURS BEFORE THE ELECTION. THEY SAID IT'S REALLY BAD. I SAID THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN TO MAY. THE POPE'S HITTING ME. JUST BEFORE THE ELECTION IN SOUTH CAROLINA. HE DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE BUILDING A WALL. WALL OFF THE UNITED STATES FROM MEXICO. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND TREMENDOUS CRIMINAL ELEMENTS ARE COMING IN. TREMENDOUS DRUGS ARE POURING IN. PEOPLE ARE COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. WE HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT TO THE POPE. THE POPE CORRECTED THE STATEMENT THE FOLLOWING DAY. JUST IN TIME. JUST IN TIME. THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE. NOW I LIKE THE POPE AGAIN OK. WITH THIS GUY FOX, I WATCHED THE ANGER IN HIS FACE. HOW DARE YOU TELL MEXICO. THEY HAVE GOTTEN THEIR WAY. I RESPECT THE MEXICAN LEADERS. THE PROBLEM IS THE CHINESE LEADERS, THE MEXICAN LEADERS, THE JAPANESE LEADERS, THEY ARE TOO SMART FOR OUR LEADERS. THEY ARE KILLING US. THEY DO YOU VALUE OUR CURRENCY. I KNOW THE GAME BETTER THAN ANYBODY. THAT NEW TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. IT IS SO BAD. THE BIGGEST THING THEY HAVE IS DEVALUATION. IT IS NOT EVEN COVERED IN THE AGREEMENT. THAT IS HOW THEY BEAT US. THEY DON'T MAKE A GREAT PRODUCT. THEY MAKE A GOOD PRODUCT. THIS EXCAVATOR BUYS CATERPILLAR. HE SEES ME FAIRLY RECENTLY AND HE IS DEPRESSED. I SAID WHAT HAPPENED, IS YOUR WIFE LEAVING YOU FINALLY? AM I GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE WITH HIM WHEN HE HEARS THIS. HOPEFULLY SHE IS NOT WATCHING. SHE WOULD KNOW EXACTLY WHO ARE TALKING ABOUT. THIS RELATIONSHIP IS GOING TO AND. MAYBE THE WORST EVER SEEN. I AM DOING A BIG FAVOR. HE SAID I JUST ORDERED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF KOMATSU EQUIPMENT. IT IS GOOD. IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS CATERPILLAR. THEY HAVE SO DEVALUED THE YEN THAT I ONLY TO MY FAMILY AND I WERE TO MY COMPANY AND I WOULD TO MY EMPLOYEES. I HAVE TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR MY COMPANY. HE BOUGHT THIS KOMATSU TRACTORS EXCAVATORS. HE WAS VERY UPSET. TAKE A LOOK AT CATERPILLAR STOCK. A LOT OF BAD THINGS ARE GOING ON. THESE COMPANIES IN THESE COUNTRIES THEY DO EVALUATE LIKE GRAND CHESS MASTERS. CHINA DOESN'T BEST OF ALL. CHINA IS KILLING US. IT IS THE SINGLE GREATEST ROBBERY WHAT CHINA HAS DONE TO THE UNITED STATES. I LOVE YOU TOO DARLING. THE SINGLE GREATEST ROBBERY. IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA. WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE NEGOTIATING FOR US. WE HAVE THE BEST BUSINESS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD HERE IN AMERICA. THIS IS GOING TO AND AND FOLKS. END FOLKS. I AM A COMMONSENSE CONSERVATIVE. I AM ACTUALLY VERY CONSERVATIVE. WE ARE TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE. GOING TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE.    WE WILL GET RID OF COMMON CORE AND OUR EDUCATION WILL BE LOCAL AGAIN. I HAVE SEEN IT. COMMON CORE IS A DISASTER. 30 COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, WE ARE LAST IN EDUCATION. WE ARE NUMBER ONE IN COSTS. WE SPEND SO MUCH MORE THE NUMBER TWO YOU MIGHT OFFER GET IT. DENMARK AND SWEDEN AND CHINA AND NORWAY. THE UNITED STATES IS NUMBER 30. AND YET WE ARE NUMBER ONE IN COSTS. THAT'S A LOT OF CAMERAS. THEY ARE ALWAYS LIVE. I CAN NEVER MAKE THE SAME STUMP SPEECH. THESE OTHER GUYS GO OUT THERE AND READ THE SAME SPEECH. EVERYONE IS SLEEPING. YOU CAN'T DO THAT IF IRAN ON LIVE TELEVISION EVERY NIGHT. IT'S NICE TO HAVE THAT ABILITY. YOU WANT TELEPROMPTER PRESIDENCY AGAIN, DO WE?  IT'S TOO EASY. LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WORLD. IT WILL CHANGE SO FAST. WE CAN DO THINGS SO FAST.

IT WAS BUILT IN THE 1880'S. WE ARE CONVERTING IT INTO A HOTEL. ONE OF THE BEST STATEMENTS THEY HAVE EVER SEEN. WE HAD A GREAT CONCEPT. A SUPER LUXURY HOTEL. IT WILL BE ONE OF THE GREAT HOTELS OF THE WORLD. THEY DID THE RIGHT THING. THEY CHOSE TRUMP. TWO YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. GOING BY GOVERNMENT SCHEDULES. THE PEOPLE AT THE GSA ARE TERRIFIC PEOPLE.

DURING THE LYNDON JOHNSON ADMINISTRATION THE POWER WAS TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE THEY WERE TO LOSE THEIR TAX-EXEMPT STATUS IF THEY GET A LITTLE BIT POLITICAL. YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE INCREDIBLE PASTORS AND MINISTERS AND THEY ARE STRONG PEOPLE AND THEY ARE AFRAID TO GO OUT AND FIGHT FOR CHRISTIANITY IN THE TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD. A MAN OR WOMAN ON THE STREET HAS MORE POWER THAN YOU DO AND YOU ARE A MINISTER. THAT IS SOMETHING WRONG. WE ARE GOING TO WORK LIKE HELL TO GET RID OF THAT LEGISLATION SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE YOUR POWER BACK. YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR POWER BACK. WE ARE GOING TO GET THAT DONE. I DON'T HAVE THIS WAS ALLOWED TO HAPPEN. THE MOST POWERFUL GROUP OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY BY FAR. THEY ARE NOT TREATED PROPERLY. CHRISTIANITY IS BEING DESTROYED. WE ARE TO GET IT BACK FOLKS. JUST REMEMBER WHAT I SAID FOLKS. THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS VERY IMPORTANT THOSE 14 PEOPLE WERE KILLED. IF THERE WERE GUNS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM. THAT GUY RIGHT THERE, THE BIG GUY WITH A BEAUTIFUL BEARD. ALMOST AS GOOD A HAD A HAIR AS I HAVE. BETTER HAIR. IF WE HAD A COUPLE OF PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM. AS AN EXAMPLE.  QUIET. GET THEM OUT. THANK YOU. WHETHER YOU ARE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, WE WANT CERTAIN THINGS. WE WANT TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY. GOOD SAFE BORDERS. A STRONG MILITARY. WE WANT TO HAVE JOBS THAT ARE BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM US LEFT AND RIGHT. THERE ARE SIX OR SEVEN THINGS YOU WANT TO HAVE. FREEDOM OF RELIGION. YOU WANT TO HAVE CERTAIN THINGS. YOU WOULD THINK THAT PEOPLE WOULD ALL BE THE SAME. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE YOU HAVE THAT HAPPEN. PARIS IS THE TOUGHEST IN THE WORLD TO HAVE A GUN. THE EARLY ONES WHO HAVE THE GUNS OF THE BAD GUYS. YOU HAVE THE STRONGEST GUN CONTROL LAWS IN THE WORLD IN FRANCE. YOU HAVE THESE THUGS, THIS GARBAGE. THEY WALK INTO THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT PLACES. IF WE HAD A FEW GUNS FIRING BULLETS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THAT WAY.  130 PEOPLE DEAD. MANY PEOPLE GRAVELY INJURED. MANY OF WHOM ARE GOING TO DIE. YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD SEEN. WE WILL PROTECT THAT SECOND AMENDMENT. IT IS NOT GOING TO BE TOUCHED.  JUST IN CLOSING, YOU HAVE TO VOTE. TOMORROW IS THE BIG DAY. I WANT GEORGIA TO LEAD THE PACK. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF SUCCESS. I LOVE GEORGIA. I WANT YOU TO LEAD THE PACK IF YOU CAN. WE'LL WIN ANYMORE. WE DON'T WIN ON TRADE. WE DON'T WIN AT THE BORDERS. WE DON'T WIN WITH OUR MILITARY. THE GREATEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD. WE CAN EVEN BE ISIS. WE ARE GOING TO KNOCK ISIS OUT SO FAST.  OUR HEALTH CARE IS HORRIBLE. HIGHLY EXPENSIVE AND IT DOESN'T WORK. IT IS GOING TO BE TERMINATED. WE DON'T WIN ANYTHING. WE DON'T WIN WITH EDUCATION. YOU ARE GOING TO LOOK BACK ON THIS NIGHT AND YOU'RE GOING TO SAY IN TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS AND FOUR YEARS OR IN 20 YEARS, THIS WAS AN AMAZING EVENING. THAT WAS AN EVENING WHEN DONALD TRUMP STOOD UP AND HE SAID, SHE WILL BE A GREAT FIRST LADY. THAT WAS THE EVENING WHEN WE REALLY BECAME GREAT AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO WIN AT EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. WITH HEALTH. WITH EDUCATION. AT THE BORDERS. OUR MILITARY. WIN WIN WIN WIN.  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. GO OUT AND VOTE. THANK YOU GEORGIA.

EARLIER THIS WEEK, DONALD TRUMP  SPOKE ABOUT HIS CAMPAIGN AND THE ISSUES HE'S FOCUSED ON AT REGENT UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. THE EVENT WAS PART OF A FORUM  THAT INCLUDED OTHER CANDIDATES.  THIS IS 45 MINUTES. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME MR. DOLLINGER TRUMP. -- MR. DONALD J. DTRUMP.  MR. TRUMP: THANK YOU EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  SO NICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PLEASE VISIT DOWN.  WE HAD A VERY EXCITING EVENING LAST NIGHT. YOU KNOW THE WORK CAUCUS, IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED.  YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO  WORK OUT.  THEY SAY IT'S HARD TO POLL. BUT WE REALLY ONE DAY LAST NIGHT. WE ENDED UP GETTING 46% OF THE VOTE.  DURING THE DAY, I SAW ALL THESE  PEOPLE, THEY ARE ALL SAYING DONALD, WE LOVE YOU DONALD.  WILL YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND SERVICE WE TURNED ON THE TV, IT WAS OBVIOUS FROM THE  BEGINNING. WE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY NIGHT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MADE ME  SO HAPPY IS, AS YOU SAW, WE TOTALLY WON WITH EVANGELICALS.  WE WERE BIG LEAGUE WITH EVANGELICALS. IT WAS SUCH A GOOD THING. WE WORKED VERY HARD. I AM PRESBYTERIAN, PROTESTANT.  I WAS GOING TO TALK TO PAT, TO IS A GREAT GENTLEMEN.  I HAVE WATCHED HIM OVER THE  YEARS.  THE JOB HE HAS DONE IS  INCREDIBLE. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, IT'S AN  HONOR TO BE WITH PAT. I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING HIM  REALLY. HE WILL PROBABLY BE GRILLING ME. -- HAVING HIM GRILL ME. LAST TIME I WAS WITH HIM WAS  ABOUT 4 YEARS AGO, GETTING AN  AWARD. THAT THE BOONE PICKENS OR FOUR  ENTREPRENEURSHIP. -- THE BOON PICKENS AWARD FOR  ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THE REASON WE ARE DOING WELL IN THE POLLS, LEADING BY A LOT WITH  ALMOST EVERYBODY IS THAT I TALK ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO FOR OUR  COUNTRY. OUR COUNTRY IS IN DEEP TROUBLE. WE OWE 19 JOIN DOLLARS. MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT $1 TRILLION IS.  HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IS  IN ONE TRILLION. SUCH A NUMBER. 10 YEARS AGO YOU NEVER EVEN  HEARD THE WORD TRILLION. BUT WE HAVE $19 TRILLION, A BAD BUDGET WAS PASSED ABOUT FOUR  WEEKS AGO THAT WILL AT LEAST $2  TRILLION TO IT. WE WILL BE OF ESSENTIALLY $1 TRILLION. AT A CERTAIN POINT -- WE WILL BE UP AT ESSENTIALLY $21 TRILLION. YOU NEED SOMEONE THAT KNOWS WHAT  THEY ARE DOING. WHEN IT COMES TO BUSINESS, I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. IT HAS BEEN AMAZING FOR ME. MY TWO SONS OUR BACKSTAGE. MAYBE I'M ALLOWED TO BRING THEM  UP, BECAUSE I'M VERY PROUD OF  THEM.  MAYBE I WILL BRING THEM ON.    GOOD, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. THIS IS DON AND ERIC AN THEY WERE WITH ME FOR THE LAST WEEK. THEY GONE AROUND MAKING SPEECHES. THEY DO A BETTER JOB THAN ME. I GO INTO THE ROOM AND WATCH  TELEVISION.  THEY SAY, THE TRUMPS ARE MAKING  A SPEECH.  SAY EHLLO DON.  THANK YOU. SO A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE ASKED ME TO SPEAK ABOUT SUCCESS,  FRIENDS OF MINE. THEY WON'T EVEN MAKE THE  PAYMENTS AND WE GIVE IT TO  CHARITY.  SO OFTEN I WILL SAY, THE REALLY SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE ARE THOSE NOT WITHOUT THE GREAT WEALTH, BUT  WITH GREAT FAMILIES.  GREAT KIDS AND WIFE AND HUSBAND.  THOSE OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THE HAPPIEST. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M SPEAKING  AGAINST MYSELF HERE. THE FACT IS, THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, IDEA WITH  THEM ALL THE TIME.  I KNOW THEM VERY WELL IN MANY CASES.  THESE ARE NOT THE HAPPIEST  PEOPLE, GENERALLY. A COUPLE OF THEM ARE HAPPY, NOT  TO MANY.  NO MATTER HOW SUCCESSFUL, THEY ALWAYS WANT MORE MORE, MORE. I GUESS I GET GUILTY OF THAT ALSO. THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE I KNOW ARE  THOSE WITH GREAT FAMILIES. SOMETHING I TALK ABOUT DURING  SUCCESS SEMINARS. A LOT OF TIMES THE PEOPLE  RUNNING FOR SEMINAR DON'T WANT  TO HEAR THAT. BUT I HAVE TO BE TRUTHFUL. I HAVE 2 REALLY GREAT BOYS. I HAVE FIVE CHILDREN ALTOGETHER. THEY HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC.  YOU KNOW IVANKA, WHO'S GOING TO  HAVE A BABY IN ABOUT A WEEK.  WE HAVE BEEN WAITING.  WE THOUGHT IOWA, WE THOUGHT NEW  HAMPSHIRE.  WE THOUGHT SOUTH CAROLINA.  WE THOUGHT VEGAS WOULD BE AN  INTERESTING ONE.  BUT SHE PROBABLY WOULD LIKE IT  DURING THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO. SHE WILL HAVE A BABY AND SHE'S  BEEN SPECTACULAR.  I HAVE TIFFANY AND AARON.  THEY ARE ALL VERY GOOD KIDS. HOPEFULLY THEY WILL STAY THAT WAY.  I THINK THE WORD IS, NOT ON WHAT -- KNOCK ON WOOD? IS ANYBODY SUPERSTITIOUS?  OH, THAT'S REAL WOOD TOO. THAT'S THE REAL DEAL.  THE REASON WE ARE RESONATING HIS  COUSIN WE HAVE TO STRENGTHEN OUR TRADE DEALS, THEY ARE HORRIBLE. WITH CHINA WE LOSING TRADE, $500  BILLION A YEAR. WHAT KIND OF DEAL IS THAT? WITH JAPAN WE LOSE HUNDREDS OF  BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. MUCH SMALLER THAN CHINA, BUT  HUNDREDS.  WE OWED JAPAN $1.6 TRILLION. WE OWE CHINA 1.7 JOIN DOLLARS. AN AMAZING THING, RIGHT? THEY TAKE OF MONEY, AND WE OWE THEM MONEY. THEY TAKE OUR FACTORIES, AND YOU  HAVE NO MANY HAVE CLOSED UP. I HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH CHINA AND JAPAN. I HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEXICO. BUT MEXICO IS KILLING US AT THE BORDER AND IN TRADE. YOU READ THE OTHER DAY CARRIERS  WERE MOVING INTO MEXICO.  I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY SAD. THEY RELEASE 1400 PEOPLE. THE EXECUTIVE WAS STANDING UP,  SAYING WE'RE GOING TO MOVE. I SAID TO MYSELF, HOW DOES THAT  HELP US? THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE AIR-CONDITIONERS, SILVA ACROSS  THE BORDER. PROBABLY HAVE ILLEGALS WALK THEM IN. NOBODY CHECK STUB -- NOBODY CHECKS THEM. EVERY ILLEGAL GETS AN AIR  CONDITIONER. FORD DOES THE SAME THING. FORD'S BUILDING A $2.5 BILLION DOLLARS PLAN.  THEY WILL HAVE ILLEGALS DRIVE CARS ACROSS THE BORDER.  IT'S VERY SAD. SO BAD THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE  TO LAUGH YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT. FORD IS BUILDING A MASSIVE PLAN. THE BISCUIT WAS MOVING FROM  CHICAGO INTO MEXICO. -- NABISCO IS MOVING FROM  CHICAGO INTO MEXICO.  THEY WERE BECOMING THE CAR CAPITAL OF THE WORLD.  A CAR WAS SCHEDULED TO BE BUILT  IN TENNESSEE, AND BOOM, THEY  TOOK IT.LAST MOMENT THEY DECIDED IT WAS GOING TO  MEXICO. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.  WE HAVE TO HAVE BORDERS. IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS WE  DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY.  PEOPLE CAN COME INTO OUR  COUNTRY, BUT THEY HAVE TO COME IN LEGALLY. WE HAVE 179,000 CRIMINAL IMMIGRANTS.  THAT MEANS OVER -- THINK ABOUT.  THAT'S LIKE FILLING OF YANKEE  STADIUM 4 TIMES ALL OF THE  COUNTRY. THESE ARE CRIMINALS.  THIS IS NOT JUST -- TESHESE ARE PEOPLE CONVICTED OF A CRIME. WE ARE GOING TO BE STRONG ON THE  BORDERS, VERY STRONG WITH TRADE. WE ARE GOING TO BE STRONG ON  PROTECTING OUR SECOND AMENDMENT.  WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF COMMON CORE, BASICALLY  EDUCATION TO WASHINGTON, WHICH IS A DISASTER. WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF  OBAMACARE. IT TURNED OUT TO BE A TOTAL DISASTER.  AND IT'S REALLY HURTING OUR COUNTRY. YOU HAVE SEMI-PART-TIME JOBS BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO  REGISTER UNDER OBAMACARE. EVERYBODY HAS PART-TIME JOBS. YOU LOOK AT THESE PEOPLE THAT  NEVER HAD A PART-TIME JOB IN HER  LIFE. SIMPLY COMPANIES -- SUDDENLY  COMING TO BRING THEM-- INTO AN UNFAIR THING. SO MANY PLANS, WHETHER IT IS THE  HEALTH CARE SAVINGS.  WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THE LINES  BETWEEN THE STATES.  ALL OF THESE POLITICIANS THAT I'M RUNNING AGAINST ARE TAKING CARE OF BY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. THEY ARE TAKEN CARE OF BY THE  OIL AND GAS COMPANIES. I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT IS NOT. I AM SELF FUNDING.I DON'T KNOW  IF THAT IS  SMART OR NOT SO SMART.  BUT AS A BIG CONTRIBUTOR, I HAVE BEEN ONE OVER THE YEARS.  I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TAKES. WE HAVE A SITUATION RIGHT NOW WITH DRUGS. THE U.S. IS THE LARGEST DRUG BUYER IN THE WORLD, DRUGS TO MAKE YOU BETTER, PHARMACEUTICALS. A FRIEND OF MINE THAT IS A  DOCTOR CAME UP TO ME AND SAID, WHY DON'T WE? ONCE I FOUND OUT WHAT HE WAS  TALKING ABOUT, I KNEW EXACTLY  WHY. THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY TAKES CARE OF ALL THE SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN, THEY HAVE A  STRONG LOBBY. WE COULD SAVE $300 BILLION.  AND WE DON'T EVEN DO IT. IF I'M THERE, THEY WILL BE SAFE, DONALD, YOU CAN DO IT. JUST ME, THEY CAN'T DO IT  BECAUSE THEY BEEN GIVEN MILLIONS  OF DOLLARS. I GUESS IT'S CALLED LEGAL  CORRUPTION. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CORRUPTED IS. WHETHER IT'S THE TIMBER INDUSTRY, ANYTHING. I WILL DO THE RIGHT THING. I'M GRATEFUL TO THE TIMBER  INDUSTRY, TOO.  BIGGER THAN THAT IS MILITARY.  I MEAN FOR YEARS WE HAVE SEEN  THE MILITARY -- THEY ORDER A  PLANE THAT THEY DON'T WANT OR  MISSILE THEY DON'T WANT BECAUSE  THE COMPANY MAKING A MISSILE HAS  MORE POLITICAL INFLUENCE. THEY ARE ORDERING TOO MUCH EQUIPMENT OR THE WRONG EQUIPMENT. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR MILITARY FIGURE, BETTER, AND  STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE.  THE CHEAPEST THING WE CAN DO,  AND NOBODY IS GOING TO MESS WITH  US.  I DON'T WANT TO USE IT.  I DIDN'T WANTED GO INTO IRAQ. THAT WAS ONE OF THE WORST  DECISIONS EVER MADE. WE LOST $2 TRILLION.  THOUSANDS OF LIVES. WE HAVE LOADED WARRIORS -- WOUNDED WARRIORS ALL OF THE PLACE. IRAN IS NOW TAKING OVER IRAQ. WHEN YOU THINK OF HOW IRAN IS DOING LATELY, WE GIVE THEM $150  BILLION AND GET NOTHING FOR IT. WE SHOULD'VE GOTTEN A BUSINESS  BACKLOG BEFORE WE STARTED  NEGOTIATING.  YOU SAY LISTEN, YOUR NOT NEGOTIATING UNTIL WE GET OUR  PRISONERS BACK.  THEY WILL SAY NO, AND THEN YOU  LEAVE THE ROOM. THEY NEVER, THEY JUST STOOD  THERE. KERRY, THE WORST NEGOTIATOR I'VE  EVER SEEN.HE NEVER LEFT THE ROOM .  YOU JUST SAY, WE NEED OUR BUSINESS BACK. THIS WAS FOUR YEARS AGO, THEY STARTED THE LONGEST NEGOTIATION  OF EVER SEEN.  WE HAVE TO HAVE HER BUSINESS  BACK. THE PORTIONS, PAT CAN TELL YOU, THE PERSIANS ARE GREAT  NEGOTIATORS. IT'S TOUGH. YOU DON'T WANT OUR PRISONERS, YOUR PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY  ARE THERE, WE NEED THEM. AND WILL MAKE A BETTER DEAL  BECAUSE IT'S EASIER.  THEY WILL SAY NO, AND WE WILL LEAVE THE ROOM. WE'LL SAY BYE BYE AND DOUBLE OF THE SANCTIONS. WITHIN 24 HOURS THEY WILL CALL AND SAY YOU GET YOUR PRISONERS  BACK.  YOU GO IN FOR SECONDS. YOU SAY, LISTEN -- MY FATHER WAS A GOOD NEGOATIATOR. HE THOUGHT I WAS TOO TOUGH. HE USED TO USE THE EXPRESSION, HE'D SAY SON, TAKE THE LUMPS  OUT. IF I DIDN'T HAVE MY FATHER I  WOULD HAVE SAID THIS ""WE'RE NOT GIVING YOU THE $150 BILLION.""  THEY WOULD BE ANGRY, YOU  PROBABLY NEVER BRING IT BACK. ""WE'RE NOT GIVING IT TO YOU."" I LEARNED SO MUCH MY FATHER.  SO I TAKE THE LUMPS OUT. LISTEN, WE HAVE A PROBLEM. I SAY, DID OUR PRISONERS LAND YET? YES, THEY JUST LANDED ON AMERICAN SOIL.  NO IW I SAW FELLAS, WE HAVE A BIG  PROBLEM. WE HAVE A COUNTRY NOT DOING WELL.  WE OWE $19 TRILLION, ESSENTIALLY  WE ARE BUST.  WE HAVE NO MONEY. WE JUST HAD A BUDGET APPROVED FOR $21 TRILLION.  WE HAVE NO MONEY. FELLAS, WE CAN GIVE YOU THE $150,000 -- $130 MILLION. THEY  WILL THINK I'M CRAZY .  ONE DAY.  I'M SORRY, I WANT TO GIVE IT TO  YOU SO BADLY, YOU HAVE NO IDEA,  I'M DYING TO GIVE IT TO YOU, BUT  WE CAN'T, WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY. THAT'S BETTER THAN SAY ""WE'RE NOT GIVING IT TO YOU."" ACCEPT THIS WAY THEY RECOVER FASTER.  I DO THE FIRST ONE -- I KNOW THE  SECOND ONES WORKS. NO WAY I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM $150 MILLION, IN A MILLION YEAR  S.  AND THE MONEY IS GONE.  2 DAYS BEFORE THE MIGHT LEFT -- BEFORE THE MONEY LEFT.  WHO READS ""THE ART OF THE DEAL?"" I ALWAYS SAY THE BIBLE IS MUCH  BETTER, NO CONTEST. NO T EVEN CLOSE. DO WE AGREE? BUT ""THE ART OF THE DEAL"" HAS  BEEN A GREAT BOOK. OBVIOUSLY KERRY DID NOT READ ""THE ART OF THE DEAL."" PROBABLY DID NOT READ THE BIBLE  EITHER.  IT'S A SAD THING, THAT WHOLE EPISODE WITH IRAN. 2 DAYS BEFORE THE MONEY YOU  SENT, THEY CAPTURE 10 BEAUTIFUL YOUNG SAILORS. THEY PUT GUNS TO THEIR HEADS,  THEY ROUGH THEM UP AT LEAST MENTALLY. THEY WERE DEVASTATED. THEY HUMILIATED OUR COUNTRY, HUMILIATED THE 10 PEOPLE. 1 WOMENA ND 9 AND 9 MEN. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DEALING  WITH. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE, FOLKS. WE'RE GOING TO BE THE SMART  COUNTRY INSTEAD OF THE DUMMIES EVERYBODY LAUGHS AT. WE ARE PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW  WHAT THEY ARE DOING. WE GET BOWE BERGDAHL, A TRAITOR,  THEY GET FIVE TRADERS THAT THE  COVETED FOR 9 YEARS. THOSE KILLERS ARE BACK ON THE  BATTLEFIELD. BUT THESE ARE THE ONES THEY  WANTED, THESE 5. SO WE KNEW HE WAS A TRAITOR BEFORE WE MADE THE DEAL BECAUSE WE HAD A GENERAL IN KERNEL  INTERVIEWED EVERYONE WHO WORKED  WITH IN THE MILITARY. SIX PEOPLE DIED LOOKING FOR HIM. 5 DEFINITELY, PROBABLY 6.  THEY WENT OUT LOOKING FOR HIM,  TRYING TO GET HIM BACK. HE LEFT. ATHAT'S THE WAY WE NEGOTIATE. THEY GET BOWE BERGDAHL, THEY GET  5 GREAT KILLERS. FOR THEM, THE PEOPLE THAT THEY  WANT. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE.  UNTIL THE STORIES AND I MEET  WITH -- I TELL THESE STORIES AND  I MEET WITH CROWDS.  FAR BIGGER THAN BERNIE. BERNIE LOOKS LIKE HE'S OVER. LOOKS LIKE HILLARY WILL BE PROTECTED FROM THE E-MAIL  SCANDAL BY THE DEMOCRATS.  CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? STILL BE PEOPLE FOR DOING MUCH LESS THAN SHE DID ARE IN  PRESENT. -- ARE IN PRISON.  AND ARE DEVASTATED. THINK OF IT. FOR DOING LESS THAN SHE DID.  AND SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE'S JUST GOING, BOY DID YOU EVER SEE SOMEBODY SO NICE TO THE PRESIDENT? OH, THE PRESIDENT IS WONDERFUL, SHE SAYS. HE WANTS TO DO THIS -- YOU KNOW WHY SHE'S DOING THAT?  BOY OH BOY, SHE'S BECOME LIKE A MARSHMALLOW. EVERYTHING HE DOES, A WITH WONDERFUL, WHAT THE PRESIDENT  WANTS TO DO. MAN, HER LIFE CANNOT BE SO EASY. BUT WHAT SHE HAS DONE IS SO WRONG AND SO UNFAIR. IT LOOKS LIKE SHE WILL BE THE  NOMINEE. IT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED, I PROMISED YOU.  IT WILL BE DISCUSSED OFTEN OFTEN OFTEN.  SO WITH THAT, I THINK WE ARE  DOING WELL. WE HAVE A GREAT TREND AND HAVE TREMENDOUS SUPPORT. WE HAVE AMAZING PEOPLE IN THIS  COUNTRY. ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING PEOPLE  IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS OUR  GREAT FRIEND, PAT. WOULD YOU COME OUT HERE PAT?  ONE OF THE GREAT PEOPLE. >> YES SIR.  GOOD MORNING TO BE  HERE. NO, WE HAD A GREAT EVENING.  WE EXPECT TO CANCEL  MANY OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS OF  THE PAST. OBAMA HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO RUN THINGS THE WAY YOU'RE SUPPOSED  TO RUN THEM. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO GET THE  CONGRESSMAN IN THE SENATORS IN. THEY MADE DEALS DURING REAGAN, AND THEY LIKE EACH OTHER. I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN POLITICS  FOR A LONG TIME, ALL MY LIFE. I'VE GOTTEN DONE TREMENDOUS  ZONING CHANGES.  I HAVE DONE POLITICS OVER THE  WORLD. WE HAVE A LOT OF JOBS GOING ALL  THE WORLD. BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN DIVISION  LIKE YOU HAVE NOW. USED TO GO TO A RESTAURANT IN  WASHINGTON, YOU SEE REPUBLICAN  HAVING DINNER WITH A DEMOCRAT  AND THEY ARE BEST FRIENDS.  YOU DON'T SEE THAT ANYMORE.  THERE IS HATRED. THE COUNTRY IS SO DIVIDED,  WHETHER IT'S AFRICAN-AMERICAN,  WHITE, CONGRESSMAN, DEMOCRAT,  REPUBLICAN -- I MEAN, IT'S LIKE  WE HAVE A WHOLE DIVIDED  COUNTRY.I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING  LIKE IT .  I USED TO BE PART OF IT,  DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HAVING  DINNER TOGETHER WITH THEIR FAMILIES.  IT WAS A NICE THING.  THERE WOULD BE COMBAT  THE NEXT DAY, BUT THEY WOULD GET ALONG.  SO TODAY WE HAVE A PRESIDENT  THAT CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE.  HE SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDERS. ONE ONE OF THE FIRST ONES I  WOULD KNOCK OUT IS HIS EXECUTIVE  ORDER ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT,  WHERE HE IS CHIPPING AWAY AT IT. THAT'S SO IMPORTANT.  THE OTHER ONE IS THE ONE ON THE BORDER, BASICALLY HE WANTS  PEOPLE TO POUR INTO THE COUNTRY  UNCHECKED. THE COURTS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THAT ONE. AMAZINGLY WE HAVE A COUPLE OF GOOD DECISIONS SO FAR. IT'S STILL OUT THERE. THE LEGAL FEES, I WOULD KNOCK IT OUT VERY FAST. I KNOW YOU BELIEVE IN THIS, WE  HAVE TO HAVE STRONG BORDERS. YOU SAW THE POPE CAME OUT AGAINST ME. HE WAS VERY NICE. THE NEXT DAY HE ISSUED A STATEMENT.  PRETTY BIG. HE WAS TOLD, OH YOU HAVE THIS  MAN NAMED TRUMP THAT WANTS TO BUILD A WALL. OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO BUILD IT.  DRUGS ARE COMING ACROSS THE  BORDER, WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A  COUNTRY. YOU DON'T HAVE A BORDER, YOU  DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY. HE WAS A LITTLE BIT STRONG/ IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IT WAS  THE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION. I SAID TO MYSELF, OH NO. MY PEOPLE CAME TO MYSELF AND  SAID, MR. TRUMP, THE POPE JUST  MADE A STATEMENT ABOUT YOU. I SAID, GOOD OR BAD?  WE HAD THE ELECTION THE NEXT  MORNING.  GOOD OR BAD? THEY SAID, NOT GOOD.  I SAID OH, THIS IS A DISASTER. AND HE TALKED ABOUT THE BORDER.  HE DID MENTION THE WALL. BUT I HAVE SEEN THE VATICAN. THE WALL GOES UP TO THE CEILING, RIGHT? I THINK HE TOOK A LITTLE HEAT. HE WAS ACTUALLY VERY NICE THE  NEXT DAY. NOBODY EXPLAINED TO HIM ABOUT THE CRIME OR DRUGS POURING IN AND THE ECONOMY. YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT THE  DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION THAT THE  POPE SAYS SOMETHING UNKIND ABOUT  YOU.  I THINK I COULD ADD  TO IT A LOT, BECAUSE WE NEEDED  JOBS BACK IN THE COUNTRY.OUR  COUNTRY HAS BEEN STRIPPED .  I LIKE CHINA, IT'S WONDERFUL.  I'M NOT ANGRY AT CHINA, I'M  ANGRY AT HER REPRESENTATIVE  DOING SUCH BAD DEALS.  NOT JUST OBAMA, THIS IS JUST  NOW.  OBAMA HAS BEEN HORRIBLE AND  OTHERS HAVE BEEN ALSO.  MOTHER SAID WITH CHINA. -- I'M NOT UPSET WITH CHINA.  I HAVE ONE OF THE BIGGEST  BANKERS AS A TENANT IN  MANHATTAN. I SELL MILLIONS OF CONDOMINIUMS TO THE CHINESE.  I CAN BE ANGRY. I HAVE GREAT RELATIONS WITH MEXICO. PUT IN ALL CASES, BOTH COUNT RIES, EVERY COUNTRY IS KILLING  US.  WE HAVE POLITICAL HACKS THAT ARE  NEGOTIATING TRADE DEALS THAT  KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT.  THEY HAVE THE SMARTEST, SERVICEPEOPLE THAT THEY PICK UP  WHEN THEY ARE PRACTICALLY THREE  YEARS OLD. THE GOAL IS PYRAMID CHAIN. OUT PEOPLE CANNOT DEAL WITH IT. WE HAVE THE GREATEST BUSINESS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND WE DO NOT USE THEM. MANY BUSINESS PEOPLE ENDORSE ME,  THE GREAT ONES. WE ARE GOING TO USE OUR GREATEST  BUSINESS PEOPLE TO NEGOTIATE TRADE DEALS.  WE HAVE HORRIBLE DEALS WITH JAPAN.  WE HAVE THE HIGHEST TAXES IN THE WORLD IN THE UNITED  STATES.  THINK OF IT, DEBITS IS LIKE THIS  AND YET WE HAVE HIGH TAXES.  ON COMING TAXES -- I'M CUTTING TAXES SUBSTANTIALLY. WE ARE GOING TO BRING JOBS BACK. CHINA IS ONE OF THE GREAT  CURRENCY MANIPULATORS IN  HISTORY, EVER.  THERE IS NOBODY EVER LIKE THEM.  JAPAN IS REALLY GOOD, BUT CHINA  IS EVEN BETTER.  THEY HAVE DONE A NUMBER ON US  WITH MANIPULATION. IN FACT, OUR DOLLAR GOES UP, AND  EVERYBODY SAYS, ISN'T THAT  WONDERFUL? BUT WE CAN'T SELL A TRACTOR.  IT'S A BAD SITUATION GOING ON.  THEY HAVE NO FEAR OF US, NO  RESPECT FOR US ANYMORE.  IN THE SELF SIGNED IT -- IN THE  SOUTH CHINA SEA, BIGGER BUILDING  IS MASSIVE MILITARY COMPLEX. THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DOING IT. BUT THEY DON'T RESPECT OUR PRESIDENT. HE GIVES THEM STATE DINNERS WHEN  THEY COME OVER. WE HAVE A LOT OF POWER OVER CHINA, WE JUST DON'T KNOW. THEY ARE TAKING SO MUCH MONEY  OUT OF OUR COUNTRY.  IT'S THE GREATEST ROBBERY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA. THEY'VE TAKEN SO MUCH MONEY OUT OF US. WE HAVE TO STOP IT. WE HAVE TO USE OUR POWER, AND WE  HAVE TO USE IT BECAUSE OF TRADE. WE CAN GET THEM TO DO THINGS LIKE THE NORTH-SOUTH KOREA PROBLEM. THAT IS PART OF THE WORLD THAT YOU LOOK AT. YOU KNOW THEY DON'T EXIST WITHOUT CHINA. THEY ARE JUST TOYING WITH US,  THEY HAVE TOTAL CONTROL.  THE OTHER ONE THAT DOES IS IRAN. WHEN WE MEET OUR DEAL A MONTH  AGO, WHY DID NOT WE INSIST THEY  TAKE CARE OF THIS? INSTEAD OF GOING OVER WITH  PLANES AND DROPPING BOMBS. I HAVE BUILDINGS IN SOUTH KOREA.  THEY MAKE A FORTUNE. BY TELEVISION SET, TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF -- I BUY TELEVISION SETS, LIMITS AMOUNTS OF THINGS. WE DON'T MAKE THINOSE THINGS ANYMORE. WE AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING ABOUT THESE BRANDS, IT SHOWS AS WE AREN'T AS YOUNG AS WE ARE  SUPPOSED TO BE.  WE HAVE 28,000 SOLDIERS BETWEEN  NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA. THAT IS A DANGEROUS JOB, BY THE  WAY. 28,000 SOLDIERS. WE GET PAID PEANUTS.  THEY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. THEY HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF US. WE ARE NOT IN THE POSITION TO BE  THE POLICEMAN OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF US. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN  DO.  I WOULD START WITH  CHINA. CHINA HAS ABSOLUTE POWER. THE STUFF COMES THROUGH CHINA.  I WOULD HAVE DONE IRAN. BUT THEY ARE A HOSTILE NATION, I  DON'T THINK YOU CAN GET ANYWHERE  WITH THEM.  THEY BOUGHT 118 AIRBUS LINES. THE MONEY GOES TO EUROPE. THEY BOUGHT A LOT OF THINGS IN ITALY, ALL OVER EUROPE.  THEY BOUGHT MISSILES. WHICH I DO  NOT KNOW THEY HAD THE RIGHT TO  BUY.  THEY BOUGHT MISSILES FROM RUSSIA.  THEY GAVE US NOTHING.  WE GAVE THEM $150 BILLION. THEY SPENT A LOT OF IT.  NOTHING GOES TO THE U.S. I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY STRONG IN THE NEGOTIATION. I WOULD NOW BE VERY STRONG WITH  CHINA. AGAIN, WE HAVE A LOT OF POWER  OVER CHINA. CHINA TAKES OUT SO MUCH MONEY.  I SAID BEFORE, $500 BILLION TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA. YOU CAN'T DO THAT.  HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE A  COUNTRY WHEN YOU DO THAT? I HATE TO TELL YOU, YOU NEED  SOMEBODY LIKE ME.   THE POLITICIANS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.  THEY TALK ABOUT FREE TRADE. EYE AND A FREE TRADE -- I AM A FREE TRADER. LIKE KERRY, THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE AIR-CONDITIONERS, SOLD THEM FOR NOTHING.  THEY ARE GOING TO LOSE 1400 JOBS.  WE EMPLOYED MEXICAN PEOPLE,  WHICH IS FINE.  THEY MAKE AIR-CONDITIONERS AND SOLD THEM. HERE'S THE STORY. THIS IS THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO TO STOP IT. EVERY TIME YOU PUT AN AIR-CONDITIONER INTO THIS COUNTRY, YOU HAVE A 35% TAX. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO MOVE.  THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WILL SAY, OH, YOU'RE NOT A CONSERVATIVE. I'M THE MOST CONSERVATIVE GUY IN  MANY WAYS.  YOU HAVE TO BE SMART.  IF EVERYBODY MOVES, WE WON'T HAVE EVERYBODY LEFT. YOU CAN HAVE THOUSANDS OF  FACTORIES THAT CLOSE IN OUR COUNTRIES. PAT TALKED ABOUT CORPORATE INVERSION. THEY ARE MOVING COMPANIES, NOT ONLY BECAUSE TAXES ARE TOO HIGH, BUT OUT OF THE U.S., LIKE  PFIZER. THEY ARE A GREAT COMPANY. THEY ARE MOVING TO GET MONEY.  THERE IS $2.5 TRILLION OUTSIDE  OF THE U.S. AND YET THE DEMOCRATS AND  REPUBLICANS AGREED TO BRING IT USIN.  IF YOU ARE OBAMA, WITHIN 10 MINUTES YOU CAN MAKE A DEAL. THIS IS THE CASE WHERE EVERYBODY  AGREES.  I COULD NOT TELL YOU THE STORY.  I LIKE THAT EXAMPLE. $2.5 TRILLION. I THINK IT COULD BE $5 TRILLION. THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO IDEA. IF THEY SAY $2.5 MILLION, IT'S  PROBABLY MUCH MORE.  SERIES WERE DEMOCRATS AND  REPUBLICANS ARE IN TOTAL  AGREEMENT. THEY DISAGREE ON ALL THESE OTHER  THINGS. HERE'S SOMETHING THEY ALL AGREED ON. WE WANT THE MONEY BACK IN OUR  COUNTRY, WHAT NO TO AGREE ON? IT SHOULD BE 10 MINUTES TO SOLVE  THAT PROBLEM. THEY AGREE HERE, AGREE HERE. NO DEAL.  THEY HAVE AGREED NOW FOR 3 YEARS.  THAT HIS LEADERSHIP. IF I WAS PRESIDENT, I WOULD GET  THEM ON THE OFFICE AND SAYS,  FELLAS -- FOLKS, BECAUSE WE  HAVE A LOT OF WOMEN, AND THAT IS  GOOD, -- FOLKS, WE HAVE TO MAKE  THIS DEAL. I WOULD HAVE IT ON AND A HALF HOUR.  UNIQUE LEADERSHIP. -- YOU NEED LEADERSHIP. YOU CAN BE PLAYING GOLF ON A BOEING 747. HE TALKS ABOUT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT AND THEN GETS IN A 747  TO PLAY GOLF. HE COMES BACK A LONG TIME LATER. IT WAS NOT LIKE YOU CAME BACK  THE NEXT DAY. HE PLAYED A LOT OF GOLF. YOU HAVE TO GET PEOPLE INTO AN  OFFICE AND MAKE DEAL.  WE HAVE GEORGE A -- WE HAVE GEORGE A ---- WE HAVE JUDGE ALITO, WHO IS TERRIFIC. WE HAVE JUDGE THOMAS, WHO IS A GREAT GUY. WE HAVE SOME WHO DO NOT WORK OUT  AS WELL. IF YOU LOOK AT JUSTICE ROBERTS, HE COULD HAVE KILLED OBAMACARE TWICE.  WHATEVER HE DOES, HE WAS  APPOINTED BY BUSH. SENATOR CRUZ IS THE ONE THAT  MOST WANTED HIM. HE WROTE EDITORIALS, SAYING THAT  YOU HAVE TO HAVE ROBERTS.  JUSTICE ROBERTS WAS A TERRIBLE JUSTICE. HE IMPROVED OBAMACARE WHEN  EVERYBODY WAS AGAINST IT.  HE HAD A SECOND TIME AT IT, AND HE PASSED IT THEN TOO.  SOME OF THE OTHER JUDGES ON THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE. RUMORS ARE THAT SOMEONE NOT EVEN SPEAK TO HIM. WHAT HE DID WAS TERRIBLE. HE WAS A BUSH APPOINTEE. THE ONE THAT PUSHED HIM HARDER  THAN ANYBODY WAS SENATOR CRUZ. SENATOR CRUZ GAVE US OBAMACARE  IN A SENSE.    THEY HAVE EDITORIALS WHERE HE   WROTE PAPERS ON WHY HE SHOULD BE  THE ONE CHOSEN SIGNED BY TED CRUZ. NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES, HE'S BEEN A DISASTER BECAUSE   OBAMACARE IS KILLING EVERYBODY. IT'S KILLING EVERYBODY.  PRO-LIFE.  VERY CONSERVATIVE. VERY, VERY SMART.   I MEAN, LIKE JUDGE SCALIA WOULD BE A PERFECT. I MEAN, HE WAS LIKE A PERFECT -- HE WAS A PERFECT REPRESENTATIVE.  I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT JUSTICE THOMAS DOESN'T GET ENOUGH   CREDIT.  HE IS.   HE'S A WONDERFUL MAN. HE'S A WONDERFUL GUY.   AND AS I SAID, JUDGE ALITO IS A TERRIFIC GUY. SO IN THAT REALM IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR ME.  THANK YOU, DAVID.  I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE UPSTAIRS.   BEAUTIFUL.  YES. VERY SIMPLE ANSWER, YES.  THEY'VE BEEN OUR MOST RELIABLE   ALLY ESPECIALLY IN THE MIDDLE   EAST.   YOU LOOK AT, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH ISRAEL. THEY WERE SO AGAINST THIS HORRIBLE IRAN DEAL. THEY WERE SO AGAINST IT.  AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, OBAMA WAS THE WORST THING THAT'S EVER   HAPPENED TO ISRAEL.   YOU CAN LOOK AT IT THAT HE'S NOT  A GOOD PRESIDENT AND HE'S NOT   DOING A GOOD JOB.   YOU LOOK AT NETANYAHU AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT HE'S GONE THROUGH.   YOU COULD JUST SEE THE LEVEL OF   EXASPERATION ON THAT MAN'S FACE.  THE MOST BASIC THINGS -- THEY   WEREN'T WINNING ANYTHING.   WHY DID WE MAKE A DEAL LIKE THIS  WITH THESE PEOPLE?  AND THEY LOOK AT US WITH NO   RESPECT. I DON'T GET IT.   I DON'T GET IT. THERE'S A LOT OF THEORIES.  I DON'T GET IT.   THIS WILL BE STUDIED AND STUDIED  FOR A LONG TIME.  THIS WILL LEAD TO NUCLEAR   PROLIFERATION, 100%.  ALL THE MONEY THAT WE GAVE AND   EVEN THE KEEPING OF THE HOSTAGES  AND THEY RELEASED THE HOSTAGES FOR $150 BILLION SO IT LOOKS   LIKE RAN SOME.  THE OTHER WAY IT WOULDN'T BE RAN SOME.   NO, I'M WITH ISRAEL, 100%?  I'M A VERY STRONG CONSTITUTIONALIST. I FEEL VERY STRONG ABOUT IT.  FRANKLY, YOU COULD SAY IT, NOT   GIVING IT A LOT OF THOUGHT BUT ALL OF THESE EXECUTIVE ORDERS, THAT'S NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL THING. NOBODY EVER --   I MEAN, WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO   JUST GOES AND DOES, YOU KNOW, HE'LL SPEND THREE MINUTES TALKING SOMEBODY INTO IT. HE'S GOT A LITTLE BURDEN AND HE   GOES AND SIGNS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER AND SAYS FIVE YEARS LATER THE COURTS WILL DECIDE. THE GOOD THING ABOUT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IS THE NEW PRESIDENT CAN IMMEDIATELY VOID THEM.   THAT'S THE ONE GOOD THING.   I CAN FORGIVE.   I MEAN, I'M PRETTY GOOD AT THAT. I DO HAVE -- EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THERE WOULD BE SOMEBODY   WHO GOES TOO FAR. YOU'VE BEEN HEARING WHAT I SAID   OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS.  THINGS WERE SAID THAT WERE LIES.  I WON'T MENTION IT BECAUSE I   CAN'T MENTION -- I'VE GOT TO BE   A GOOD PERSON TODAY.  AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT HOUR, I'M SORRY.  BUT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY UNTRUTHS TOLD.  YOU KNOW -- KNOWING, KNOWING.   I THINK WHAT HAPPENED TO BEN   CARSON WAS TERRIBLE WHEN THEY   SAID HE LEFT THE RACE.  HERE COME ON OVER, VOTE FOR ME.   I THINK I WOULD HAVE WON IOWA. THAT AFFECTED ME.   WE'VE GOT A SECOND AND THREE FIRSTS.   SO I'M NOT COMPLAINING.   BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO BEN CARSON, WHAT HAPPENED THERE WAS HORRIBLE. THE NOTICE -- VOTER VIOLATION. THAT'S LIKE A FRAUDULENT   DOCUMENT THAT WAS SENT.   THERE HAVE BEEN BAD THINGS   HAPPENING OUT THERE.  REAL ESTATE IS TOUGH.   THESE POLITICIANS ARE NOT SUCH   GOOD PEOPLE.  WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S   INTERESTING, ONE MAGAZINE SAID   DONALD TRUMP IS A WORLD CLASS   BUSINESSMAN. I'M ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND I DEAL WITH ALL POLITICIANS.  HONESTLY, I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE DONE THIS.   I WAS EXASPERATED. I HAD A LOT OF JOBS GOING. MY CHILDREN ARE YOUNGER AND THEY  CAN DO GREAT JOBS. EXCELLENT EXECUTIVES. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I WAS   GOING TO DO OR REALLY WANTED TO   DO.   I LOVED WHAT I WAS DOING. THE FACT IS THAT AS A BUSINESSMAN YOU GET ALONG WITH   ALL POLITICIANS OR YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.  SO I GET ALONG WITH DEMOCRATS. I GET ALONG WITH LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES.  I GET ALONG WITH EVERYBODY BECAUSE THAT WAS MY THING. I GET ALONG WITH BOB -- WHERE'S BOB IN THE AUDIENCE?  WHERE IS HE?  A FANTASTIC PERSON, OK? YOU KNOW THAT. STAND UP.   HE'S A FANTASTIC PERSON. BUT I GET ALONG WITH EVERYBODY.   I GET ALONG WITH EVERYBODY.   AND THAT WAS IMPORTANT.   AND I TELL PEOPLE AND PEOPLE WOULD FORGIVE FOR THAT.   YOU WANT TO GET ALONG WITH   DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS.   FOR THE MOST PART THAT'S BEEN   USED ON ME.   ONCE I EXPLAIN IT, MOST PEOPLE UNDERSTAND.  ACTUALLY THERE ARE   SOME NAMES THAT I'VE GOTTEN TO RESPECT.  WE STARTED WITH 17. WE'RE NOW DOWN TO FIVE. SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE DEALT WITH, I HAVE A LOT OF   RESPECT FOR. THE MAIN QUALITY IS SOMEBODY   THAT CAN BE A GREAT PRESIDENT IF  SOMETHING HAPPENS TO YOU.   DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S GOT TO BE  NUMBER ONE?   AND THEN I WANT SOMEBODY THAT COULD HELP ME WITH GOVERNMENT.  SO MOST LIKELY THAT WOULD BE A   POLITICAL PERSON BECAUSE YOU   KNOW, I'M BUSINESS AND I'M VERY GOOD AT WHAT I DO AND ALL OF   THAT. AND I'M ALSO VERY, VERY POLITICAL.  YOU'VE SEEN ME -- WHEN YOU CAN GET ZONING ON THE WEST SIDE OF MANHATTAN TO BUILD ALMOST 6,000   UNITS OF HOUSING AND YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH NEW YORK CITY   POLITICS, BELIEVE ME, THAT'S AS TOUGH.  I DON'T SEE ISRAEL-PALESTINE BUT  IT'S ABOUT AS TOUGH A DEAL -- I VIEW THAT AS THE SINGLE TOUGHEST DEAL. ANYBODY CAN MAKE A DEAL AND WE'RE GOING TO GIVE IT A SHOT.  BUT A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE HAVE GONE DOWN TRYING TO GIVE THAT A   SHOT. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS YOU   HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY THAT CAN   BE A GREAT PRESIDENT. BUT AFTER THAT, YOU WANT   SOMEBODY THAT CAN HELP YOU WITH LEGISLATION GETTING IT THROUGH,   ETC., ETC.  I WOULD SAY -- AND IT'S TOO EARLY.  I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT IT A LOT.  I'M THINKING ABOUT GETTING THE   BALL OVER THE LINE AND GET THIS   THING DONE.   AND IT'S A VERY INTERESTING   THING BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE KNOW   HOW TO DO THAT, SOME PEOPLE   DON'T.  I DO WANT SOMEBODY THAT'S   POLITICAL BECAUSE I WANT TO GET LOTS OF GREAT LEGISLATION THAT WE ALL WANT --  WELL, IT'S AN AMAZING  QUESTION BECAUSE YOU KNOW   THERE'S A SIX-YEAR STATUTE OF   LIMITATIONS, MIGHT BE FIVE, BUT   I THINK IT'S SIX. THE ANSWER IS I WOULD INSTRUCT   THEM TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY OUR CALL TO SAY INDICT.  BUT CERTAINLY YOU WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT   BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT GENERAL   PETRAEUS. THEY GAVE HIM TWO YEARS SUSPENDED.  THEY WANTED TO TAKE HIS RANK   AWAY FROM HIM. I FOUGHT THIS VERY HARD.  I SAID WHY DON'T YOU FOCUS ON   BEATING ISIS AND LEAVE GENERAL PETRAEUS ALONE? LEAVE HIM ALONE.  I THINK IT HELPED HIM.  BUT THEY WANTED TO CUT HIS RANK WAY DOWN.   HE SUFFERED GREATLY OVER THIS.  AND WHAT HE DID IS NOTHING   COMPARED TO WHAT SHE DID. SO I WOULD INSTRUCT MY ATTORNEY GENERAL PLEASE LOOK AT IT. AND IF THERE'S SOMETHING THERE  -- THERE SEEMS BE A LOT THERE BECAUSE WE READ ABOUT PEOPLE   THAT ARE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD. HOW OFTEN DID YOU HEAR SOMEBODY SAY SHE DID NOTHING WRONG? BUT THEY'RE PROTECTING HER   BECAUSE SHE'S THE NUMBER ONE   RUNNER.   SHE'S SAYING HOW WONDERFUL OBAMA  IS. DID YOU SEE ANYTHING LIKE IT? EVERY SINGLE THING HE WANTS TO D SHE'S SAYING GREAT.   SHE'S DOING IT FOR THAT REASON.   BELIEVE ME FOLKS. WELL, DONALD, I WANT TO THANK   YOU.  I THINK THE AUDIENCE APPRECIATES  YOU AND LOVES YOU.   THANK YOU.  WE'LL DO IT AGAIN.   GREAT JOB, YOU'VE DONE. GREAT JOB.   ",Donald Trump at Regent University's Presidential Candidate Forum

WE ARE NOT KIDDING. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE THE DUMMIES ANYMORE. WE WILL BE THE SMART ONES. I WANT TO THANK YOU. THEY SAY THIS IS RECORD-SETTING, THE BIGGEST THEY HAVE EVER HAD. THE BIGGEST THEY HAVE EVER HAD AT DOING THIS STUFF. ISN'T THAT INCREDIBLE? INCREDIBLE. 10,000 PEOPLE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL ARENA. I WANT TO THANK MICHAEL AND HIS WIFE. THEY OWN THE PLACE. THEY WERE SO NICE. A HAVE REALLY DONE A GREAT JOB. SETTING RECORDS LIKE THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. BUT TOMORROW, YOU HAVE GOT TO GO OUT AND VOTE. WE HAVE SUCH MOMENTUM WITH WHAT HAPPENED IN SOUTH CAROLINA LAST WEEK. WHAT A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE. WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THE WEEK BEFORE WAS SO INCREDIBLE. AND WE ARE LEADING AND EVERYONE IS TALKING AND WATCHING TELEVISION TONIGHT. AND THEY SAY -- DONALD TRUMP WILL WIN TOMORROW. DON'T EVER ASSUME YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE. BUT IF YOU ASSUME WE WILL TIE, YOU WILL GO OUT AND VOTE. AS THEY WOULD SAY AT THE OLD-SCHOOL CAUCUS, BUT FORGET THE WORD CAUCUS, JUST GO OUT AND VOTE. SO, A LOT OF THINGS HAVE HAPPENED SINCE JUNE 16 WHEN I ANNOUNCED I WAS RUNNING. WHO KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN? I THOUGHT WE WOULD BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACK AT THIS TIME BUT WE WOULD EDIT IT OUT AT THE END LIKE A RACEHORSE. WE WIN IN THE END. BUT WE HAVE A BIG LEAD AND WE DON'T WANT TO BLOW IT. FRANKLY, WE HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, HOAX. WE WILL MAKE -- WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, FOLKS. WE WILL MAKE IT BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT OVER THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS, I HAVE BEEN GOING AROUND AND EVERY CROWD LOOKS LIKE THIS ALL OF THE TIME. THE PEOPLE ARE AMAZING. I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT -- MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE. BECAUSE OUR PEOPLE, OUR PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE INCREDIBLE. NOW, IT STARTED ON JUNE 16 AND I CAME DOWN AND TALKED ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. WE HAVE SHERIFF JOE. I LOVE SHERIFF JOE. WHERE IS SHERIFF JOE? I WILL TELL YOU WHAT -- THERE HE IS, RIGHT THERE. WHEN SHERIFF JOE ENDORSES TRUMP, THERE IS NO ONE ELSE LIKE DONALD TRUMP. THANK YOU SHERIFF JOE. IT STARTED WITH THAT AND IT STARTED. I MADE A SPEECH IN FRONT TOWER TO I TOOK A DEEP BREATH BECAUSE IT TAKES GUTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I DON'T DO THIS -- OTHER GUYS HAVE SPENT $148 MILLION AND I STILL FUNDING, BY THE WAY, I AM SPENDING MY OWN MONEY. I DON'T NEED THESE PEOPLE. I DON'T NEED THEIR MONEY. VERY IMPORTANT. I DON'T KNOW IF I GET THE CREDIT FOR THAT. WHEN YOU GO INTO A BOOTH AND VOTE, I DON'T KNOW IF I GET THE CREDIT BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE ALL TAKEN CARE OF BY THEIR DONORS AND SPECIAL INTERESTS AND THEIR LOBBYISTS. 100%. 100%.  I USED TO BE THOSE PEOPLE, JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. WHO KNOWS THE GAME? I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TAKES AND WHEN SOME AND GIVES YOU $5 MILLION AND THEY REPRESENT THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND THEY COME TO YOU AND THEY NEED A FAVOR -- YOU KNOW, YOU WANT TO BE AN HONEST GUY BUT BELIEVE ME, THEY HAVE YOU 100%. WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY IS NOT GOING TO BE THE THING THAT IS DONE. WHEN THEY COME TO SEE ME, AND THEY SAY -- WE NEED THIS OR THAT, I SAY, FOLKS, I HAVE NO INTEREST. I HAVE TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE COUNTRY. WE WILL GREAT AND IT OUT. WE WILL STRAIGHTEN IT OUT. I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, A TERRIBLE THING HAPPENED THIS WEEK. YOU SOLVE THE AIR-CONDITIONING. MY SON ERIC WAS HERE. WE SAID WE OUGHT TO WRITE A LETTER. THESE ARE ACTIVIST SONS. WHERE ARE THEY? GREAT SONS. THERE THEY ARE. AND, THEY SAID WE OUGHT TO WRITE A LETTER TO CARRIER. HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED. DO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK? BERRY SAID. THERE IS NOTHING WE ARE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT UNLESS WE GET REALLY SMART AND TOUGH. I WENT TO THE BEST SCHOOL, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE RIGHTS WILL OR GO TO HIGH SCHOOL TO UNDERSTAND IT. THEY HAVE ANNOUNCED THEY HAD 1400 JOBS -- THEY FIRED EVERYONE AND SAID THEY WERE MOVING TO MEXICO. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE MOVING TO MEXICO. IT HAS BECOME THE NEW CHINA. THEY TOOK THEIR CELL PHONE, 1400 PEOPLE WERE DEVASTATED. THEY SAY THEY ARE GOING TO MEXICO. IF I AM THE PRESIDENT, HERE IS WHAT WE DO. WE WRITE THEM A LITTLE NOTE AND WE CONGRATULATE THEM IN THEIR MOVE. WE HELP THEY DON'T HAVE ANY -- HAVE TOO MANY COST OVERRUNS. AND WE TELL THEM THE FOLLOWING -- EVERY TIME YOU MAKE AN AIR-CONDITIONING UNIT AND EVERY TIME YOU SEND THAT UNIT INTO THE UNITED STATES. YOU WILL PAY A 35% TAX. 35%.   AND COME IT WILL BE AMAZING HOW THOSE NUMBERS WILL CHANGE. AMAZING. AND I DON'T CARE. THEY WILL CALL ME, THEY WANT TO EVEN BOTHER WITH THE LOBBYISTS BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT HAVE GIVEN ME MONEY, THE SPECIAL INTERESTS WILL NOT HAVE GIVEN ME MONEY, THE DONORS WILL NOT HAVE GIVEN ME MONEY. WHEN I WENT TO THE LAST DEBATE, USE ALL THAT MESS. I DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE THERE, MY SONS AND MY WIFE AND THE WHOLE ROOM WAS PACKED WITH SPECIAL INTEREST AND DONORS. GUYS GOT UP AND SPOKE SO BADLY AND THE AUDIENCE WENT CRAZY. I LOOKED AND I KNEW HALF THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM. THEY WERE ALL SPECIAL INTEREST GUYS. ONE REPRESENTS PHARMACEUTICALS. WE HAVE GOT TO PUT OUR COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER. IT IS A MESS. A MESS. WE HAVE GOT TO DO IT. SO, AS AN EXAMPLE, THE DRUG COMPANIES. A DOCTOR COMES UP TO ME, AND HE SAYS -- WE ARE DYING WITH OBAMA CARE. IT IS NOT WORKING. HE TELLS ME THERE -- HE HAS MORE ACCOUNTS AND HE HAS NURSES. HE SAID -- THE YOU KNOW THEY DO NOT BID OUT DRUGS. WE ARE THE LARGEST DRUG BUYER IN THE WORLD AND WE DO NOT BID THEM OUT. I AM SURPRISED BUT NOT THAT SURPRISED. THE DRUG COMPANIES AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE ALL MAKING MASSIVE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PEOPLE I AM RUNNING AGAINST AND TO THE OTHERS. I WILL NOT USE THAT EXPRESSION BECAUSE I WILL GET IN TROUBLE WITH THOSE PEOPLE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE JUST SAID? RIGHT? WE WILL DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID. SO, I SAID -- THAT IS OK, YOU CAN SIT DOWN. I SAID WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THEY ARE ALL BEING TAKEN CARE OF. IF WE BID OUT PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS, WE WOULD SAVE EACH YEAR $300 BILLION. $300 BILLION. AS A COUNTRY. YOU HAVE THAT WITH THE MILITARY GOING ON BECAUSE THE MILITARY OUTFITS THAT MAKE THE WEAPONS, I DO HAVE A LITTLE PROTESTER? GET HIM OUT. GET HIM OUT.   GET HIM OUT. WHERE IS THE PROTESTER? WHERE IS THE? I DON'T EVEN SEE HIM. LOOK, I LOVE PROTESTERS BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY THE CAMERA TURN AND SHOW HOW BIG THE AUDIENCE IS IS WHEN THERE IS A PROTESTER. OTHERWISE, THEY NEVER TURN. I LOVE PROTESTERS. DON'T WORRY. IT IS OK. FOR A LONG TIME, I DIDN'T KNOW THESE GUYS. MY WIFE, I GO HOME -- I SAY, HOW DID I DO? DID YOU SEE HOW BIG THE CROWD WAS? WE HAVE THE BIGGEST CROWDS BY FAR THAN ANYONE, MUCH BIGGER THAN BERNIE, ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY HE IS SECOND. BUT I THINK HE IS HEADING DOWN. LOOKS LIKE BERNIE IS HEADING DOWN, AND HILLARY WILL GET A PASS IN HER E-MAIL SCANDAL BUT WE WILL BE BRINGING IT OUT. WE WILL BE BRINGING IT UP. LOOKS LIKE WE WILL BE RUNNING AGAINST HILLARY WHICH IS GOOD. HOW DID SHE GET A PASS IN THAT DEAL? HOW? RIGHT? IT WILL NOT HAPPEN. IT WON'T HAPPEN. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN. SO, WITH THESE CAMERAS COME THEY NEVER SHOW THE AUDIENCE. I SAID TO MY WIFE -- DID YOU SEE THE SIZE OF THE AUDIENCE? 25,000 PEOPLE. AND SHE SAID THAT SHE DID NOT SEE THE CROWD. THEY ONLY SEE MY FACE. THE OTHER NIGHT, RECENTLY, I HAD 12,000 PEOPLE -- GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD.   I LOVE IT. YOU KNOW, THE OTHER NIGHT, WE HAD 12,000 PEOPLE, BERNIE HAD 3000. I TURN ON THE TELEVISION BECAUSE I DO LIKE WATCHING MYSELF. I TURN ON THE TELEVISION AND THEY ARE SAYING -- BERNIE SANDERS HAD A MASSIVE CROWD OF 3000 PEOPLE. THEN, THEY GO TO DONALD TRUMP. AND DONALD TRUMP SPOKE BEFORE A CROWD TODAY. SO, HE HAD A MASSIVE CROWD OF 3, 12 THEY DON'T TO MENTION. THIS IS REALLY BAD. THESE ARE THE MOST DISHONEST PEOPLE I THINK I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH. THEY ARE BAD PEOPLE. BAD PEOPLE. NOT ALL OF THEM. THEY ARE NOT ALL BAD. ABOUT 80% BAD. 10% OK. 5% GOOD AND 5% VERY GOOD. THAT IS NOT BAD. WHAT I DID ON JUNE 16, WE CAME OUT AND WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT TRADE AND HOW WE ARE BEING RIPPED OFF BY CHINA AND JAPAN AND MEXICO. RIPPED OFF BY VIETNAM AND INDIA. I EVERY COUNTRY. EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL REPRESENTED BY THESE PEOPLE WHO WE THINK ARE REPRESENTING US. WHEN I SAY I AM SELF FUNDING, IT MEANS MUCH MORE THAN YOU THINK. IT MEANS MUCH MORE. I AM TELLING YOU. YOU KNOW, IF IT IS A TIE, THEY SHOULD VOTE FOR ME, THAT IS WHAT I AM SAYING. THEY SHOULD VOTE FOR ME. I WILL SAY THIS -- THESE ARE THE MOST THIS HONEST PEOPLE I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH. POLITICIANS. I HAVE DEALT WITH THEM ALL MY LIFE SO I AM NOT CERTAIN RISE VERY IT IS NOT LIKE I AM SHAKEN UP. THIS GUY, TED CRUZ LIES MORE THAN ANY HUMAN BEING I HAVE DEALT WITH. UNBELIEVABLE. AND HE HOLDS UP THE BIBLE AND HE LIVE AND THEN HE HOLDS UP THE BIBLE AGAIN AND HE LIES. THIS WAS SORT OF COOL. AT THE LAST DEBATE, MARCO RUBIO, NICE GUY. NICE GUY. HE LOOKED A CROSS AND HE SAID -- YOU ARE A LIAR AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD A POLITICIAN CALL ANOTHER POLITICIAN A LIAR. IT WAS A THING OF BEAUTY. I HAVE NEVER HEARD IT. SO, IT THEN GAVE ME COVERED. IN THE LAST ELECTION, IN SOUTH CAROLINA, THE MORNING OF THE ELECTION, THE MORNING OF THE ELECTION. A CROSSTHINK OF IT. YOU THINK IT IS ALL DONE AND YOU ARE JUST WAITING AROUND. YOU BETTER BE THERE. IF YOU ARE NOT THERE, I WILL BE SO ANGRY. I DON'T WANT TO TURN ON THE TELEVISION AND THEY -- EVERYONE LOVES THE JOB HE IS GOING TO DO BUT HIS PEOPLE WERE SUE -- WERE TOO LAZY TO GO OUT AND CAUCUS. AFTER THIS, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. AFTER THIS, WE HAVE THE WHOLE FEC. WE WILL DO SO GREAT. WE HAVE GEORGIA, TENNESSEE, SO MANY GREAT ONES. I THINK WE WILL DO VERY WELL IN TEXAS. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE EVANGELICALS WERE SUPPOSED TO GO WITH TED CRUZ. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO GO WITH TED CRUZ. HONESTLY, I WON THE EVANGELICALS BY A A LOT. ACTUALLY, I WON EVERYTHING. I WON SHORT PEOPLE AND TALL PEOPLE. I WON FAT PEOPLE, SKINNY PEOPLE. I WON HIGHLY EDUCATED, OK EDUCATED, AND PRACTICALLY NOT EDUCATED AT ALL. I LOVE THEM ALL. I WON THE EVANGELICALS BIG AND I WON THE MILITARY BIG. BIG. I WON, THE VETERANS. OH, THOSE VETERANS, I LOVE THOSE VETERANS. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THOSE VETERANS WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS, RIGHT? THESE ARE THE GREATEST PEOPLE. I MEET SO MANY WOUNDED WARRIORS. THEY HAVE MORE COURAGE AND GUTS, I HATE TO SAY IT, THEN ALL OF US PUT TOGETHER. THESE ARE THE MOST INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. THEY ALWAYS HAVE A SMILE ON THEIR FACE WHEN I MEET THEM. AND BOY OH BOY, THEY HAVE TAKEN SOME SHOTS AND THEY ARE AMAZING. WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. WE WOULD NOT BE THERE IF IT WAS NOT FOR THEM. AND WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM. WE WILL STRAIGHTEN OUT THAT V.A. MESS. THAT CORRUPT -- IT IS HARD TO EVEN BELIEVE. 22 SUICIDES A DAY. THINK OF IT FROM THE VETERANS. 22 SUICIDES. THAT IS UNTHINKABLE. LOOK AT THE SIGNS. THAT IS SO INCREDIBLE. WOW. INCREDIBLE. I DID NOT KNOW THIS. THAT IS -- THAT IS INCREDIBLE. WHO WOULD THINK THIS. THAT THIS WAS POSSIBLE. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE GOING TO BE DOING THIS. WE WILL STRAIGHTEN OUT THE VETERANS. VETERANS, DON'T WORRY. WE ARE COMING. WE ARE GOING TO STRAIGHTEN OUT A LOT OF THINGS. WE WILL GET RID OF COMMON CORE. WE ARE GETTING RID OF COMMON CORE. WE WILL MAKE EDUCATION AWESOME. IN THE WORLD, TOP 30 IN THE WORLD, WE ARE NUMBER 30. THAT MEANS WE ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST THAT WE ARE NUMBER ONE IN TERMS OF COST PER PUPIL. NUMBER TWO IS SO FAR AWAY IT DOES NOT EVEN EXIST. WE ARE NUMBER 30 AND YET WE ARE NUMBER ONE IN THE COST HER PUPIL. LET US LOOK AT MY CAMPAIGN. I SPENT -- I SPENT A LOT OF MONEY THAT I SPENT BY FAR THE LEAST AMOUNT OF MONEY AND I AM BY FAR NUMBER ONE. ISN'T THAT GOOD? SOMEBODY ELSE, I WON'T MENTION, BUT THEY WERE NASTY TO ME. THEY TOOK $25 MILLION. 25 MILLION DOLLARS AND I AND SUPPOSED TO SAY HE IS A NICE PERSON. AND THEY WERE PHONY ADS. TED CRUZ HAS AN AD, SOMETHING TO DO WITH ME WANTING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR LAND AND KEEP IT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. IT IS A TED CRUZ SCAM. THE EVANGELICALS DID NOT VOTE FOR HIM BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE LIARS. THEY ARE SMART PEOPLE. THEY DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR A LIAR. BUT IT IS TRUE. I HAVE AN AD RUNNING RIGHT NOW. SOMETHING TO DO -- AND A COUPLE OF PEOPLE TOLD ME THAT I AM BACKING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO KEEP THE LAND THAT IS CURRENTLY OWNED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE SHOULD GIVE THAT LAND TO EVERYONE AND DIVIDE IT UP. I AM SAYING TO MYSELF -- WELL, IT IS NOT A SUBJECT THAT I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT. BUT THIS IS A TED CRUZ AD. THIS GUY IS SICK. THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS GUY. ON SATURDAY, WHEN WE HAD TO VOTE, WHEN WE HAD TO VOTE IN SOUTH CAROLINA, SATURDAY -- I WAKE UP AND THINK IT IS GOING TO BE A NICE, EASY DAY. I GET HIT WITH A CALL FROM MY MANAGEMENT PEOPLE WHO BY THE WAY DID A FANTASTIC JOB. THEY ARE FANTASTIC. I GET HIT EARLY IN THE MORNING THAT SOMEONE DID A ROBO CALL BUT TED CRUZ DENIED IT. THIS IS THE DAY OF THE ELECTION. THE ROBO CALL HAD TO DO WITH THE CONFEDERATE FLAG. THIS WAS NOT A GOOD ROBO CALL TO GET AT 8:00 IN THE MORNING. THEN, I HAD A SECOND ROBO CALL AT 12:00 -- TOTAL LIES. I WON'T GO INTO SUBJECT MATTER. A SECOND ROBO CALL ON ELECTION DAY AND IT SAID -- THIS ONE HAD TO DO WITH GAY MARRIAGE. THIS GOES TO EVERYONE. SOUTH CAROLINA. INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. AND I SAID -- MAN, IF I GET HIT WITH TWO ROBO CALLS LIKE THAT, HOW CAN I POSSIBLY WIN? THE PEOPLE WERE SO SMART. I WON IN A LANDSLIDE. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? I WON IN A LANDSLIDE. I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU TWO OTHER STORIES. I WON WITH MEN, THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT TO ME. I WON WITH WOMEN, THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.   SO, WE ARE DOING REALLY WELL. SO, WE ARE SENDING A LETTER, SENDING A LETTER TO TERRIER AND IN THAT LETTER WE ARE GOING TO SAY THAT IF I SHOULD WIN, WE ARE GOING TO COME AFTER YOU FOR A LOT OF MONEY EVERY KIND USED AND AN AIR CONDITIONER. WE ARE SENDING A LETTER TO WARD. I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FORD FOR TWO YEARS. FORD IS BUILDING A $2.5 MILLION PLANT. WHAT IS GOOD -- WE HAVE THESE REALLY STUPID TRADES. EVERY DEAL WE MAKE IS STUPID. WHETHER IT IS SERGEANT BIRDSALL -- WE GET A TRAITOR AND THEY GET FIVE KILLERS THEY HAVE COVETED FOR NINE YEARS. WE GET ONE, THEY GET FIVE. OURS IS NO GOOD. LET US AND HIM BACK. FLYOVER. FLYOVER AND DROPPED HIM, MAYBE YOU GIVE HIM A PARACHUTE, NAVY YOU DON'T. DEPENDS ON IF WE HAVE AN EXTRA PAIR ISSUE. PROBABLY BEST IF WE HAVE AN EXTRA PARACHUTE. HE WENT OUT INTO THE WORLD AND HE DID NOT FIND IT TOO COMFORTABLE. HE WAS SLAPPED AROUND PRETTY GOOD. HE CAME BACK. HE COULD NOT GET ACCESS TO ENOUGH. FIVE, MAYBE SIX PEOPLE WERE KILLED LOOKING FOR HIM AND WE HAD A GENERAL AND A KERNEL THAT WENT TO SEE HAS PLATOON. AND THEY ALL SAID HE DESERTED AND WE KNEW HE DESERTED WHEN WE MAKE THE DEAL. WHY WOULD YOU MAKE A DEAL FOR A DESERTER AND GIVE UP FIVE PEOPLE WHO THEY WANTED. WHY WOULD WE GIVE UP, WHY WOULD WE GIVE UP FIVE KILLERS, WHY? FOR ONE DIRTY, ROTTEN TRAITOR. BECAUSE WE HAVE INCOMPETENT LEADERSHIP. WE HAVE INCOMPETENT LEADERSHIP. IF THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE, BUT KNOWING COMMITTEE THAT MAKES IT EVEN WORSE. IS THAT A CORRECT STATEMENT, MR. NAVY? HE IS SHAKING HIS HEAD. I KNOW MY PEOPLE. I KNOW MY PEOPLE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE DEALS LIKE THAT ANYMORE. WE ARE NOT MAKING AN IRAN DEAL WHERE WE GIVE THEM $150 BILLION AND WE GET NOTHING. THINK OF IT. WE GO INTO THE IRAN DEAL COME IT STARTED YEARS A GO. HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN NEGOTIATING? ONE OF THE NEWSPAPERS CALLED UP AND SAID HOW LONG SHOULD THAT DEAL HAVE TAKEN? AND I SAID ONE DAY, MAYBE ONE WEEK. IT HAS BEEN YEARS. WE SHOULD HAVE DEMANDED THE PRISONERS BACK BEFORE WE STARTED NEGOTIATIONS. AND WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THEM. YOU RATCHET UP AND YOU GET UP AND YOU SAY -- LISTEN, WE ARE GOING TO RATCHET UP THE SANCTIONS. WE WANT OUR PRISONERS BACK. THEY NEVER WALKED FROM THAT DEAL. WE WERE RIDICULED IN THAT DEAL. EVEN IN THE END, THE WORST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ISRAEL. IT IS A DISASTER FOR ISRAEL. THE DEAL IS NO GOOD. IT WILL LEAD TO NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION. THEY WILL HAVE NUKES. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO DEVELOP THEM, THEY CAN JUST LIVE THEM AND HAVE A LOT OF MONEY LEFT OVER. WHERE ARE THEY SPENDING THE 150? THEY ARE NOT BUYING BOEING. THEY ORDERED MISSILES -- I DIDN'T KNOW THEY COULD BUY MISSILES. HE ORDERED MISSILES FROM RUSSIA AND THEY ARE ALL OVER EUROPE SPENDING THAT MONEY. THE UNITED STATES GETS NOTHING. THEY ATTACKED US AND THEY PUT OUR 10 SAILORS IN A BEGGING POSITION, ON THEIR KNEES WITH THEIR HANDS UP, WITH THE GUY WITH A ROUGH MOUTH -- I WOULD LIKE TO SMACK HIM. AND HE IS BARKING ORDERS LIKE HE IS A BIG SHOT AND THEY HAVE RIFLES AT THEIR HEADS. AND THESE ARE OUR FRIENDS AND OBAMA ADDRESSES THEIR LEADER AS THE SUPREME LEADER AND OBAMA REFUSES TO ISSUE THE WORDS -- RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. WHEN I CALL FOR A BOYCOTT, WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT OUT OF INTELLIGENCE. WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY STRONG AND SAFE AND WE HAVE NO CHOICE. BELIEVE ME.   WE HAVE SOME AMAZING THINGS GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WE WILL MAKE IT SO STRONG. ONE OF THE THINGS I MOST LOOK FORWARD TO DOING IS TAKING OUR MILITARY AND JUST REWORKING IT. GETTING THAN THE EQUIPMENT THEY WANT, NOT THAT THAT WAS GOTTEN FOR POLITICAL GAIN BY SOME GUY THAT HAS CONTROL OF A COMPANY THAT IS GOOD WITH THE SENATORS, SOME OF WHOM I AM RUNNING AGAINST. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT SO STRONG. HERE IS WHAT WE DO. WE ARE GOING TO NOW TALK FOR TWO SECONDS ABOUT OBAMA CARE. BECAUSE IT IS A SUBJECT THAT IS VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART AND IT IS KILLING OUR COUNTRY. IT IS GOING TO FAIL OF ITS OWN WEIGHT BY 17. IT IS GOING DOWN. IT IS GOING TO FAIL LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT THE REPUBLICANS, UNLESS I END THERE, WILL COME AND THEY'LL IT OUT. THEY BAILED IT OUT WITH THIS HORRIBLE BUDGET FROM FOUR WEEKS AGO. OBAMACARE WILL BE REPEALED AND REPLACED. OBAMACARE -- WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A STRONG COUNTRY AGAIN AND OBAMACARE HAS TO GO. WE CANNOT AFFORD IT. YOU WILL END UP WITH GREAT HEALTH CARE FOR A FRACTION OF THE PRICE AND THAT WILL TAKE LATE IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE GO IN. IMMEDIATELY. FAST. WHAT?  OK. IT IS NOT WORKING FOR YOU. IT DOESN'T WORK -- DOES IT WORK FOR ANYONE? NOBODY. WE GET IT CHANGED. WE GET IT CHANGED AND FIXED. IT WILL BE BEAUTIFUL. IT DOESN'T.    WISEGUYS. WE HAVE WISEGUYS. SOMETIMES, YOU WOULD LIKE TO SIT DOWN WITH A GUY LIKE THAT. IF YOU TALK TO SOMEONE LIKE THAT FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES, I REALLY THINK UNLESS THERE ARE OTHER MOTIVES WHICH THERE OFTEN ARE WHAT YOU TALK TO SOMEONE LIKE THAT FOR 15 MINUTES. WHAT DO WE ALL WANT? SAFETY, SECURITY, HEALTH CARE, GOOD JOBS. RIGHT? WHETHER YOU ARE A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT, A CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN -- DON'T WE ALL WANT SECURITY. STRONG, STRONG SECURITY. BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS NOW IN TROUBLE. WHEN IT COMES, AND WHEN I FIRST CAME DOWN I SAID TRADE AND THE BORDER. THAT BORDER IS GOING TO BE SO STRONG AND THE SYRIANS CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO COME IN. WE DO NOT KNOW WHO THEY ARE. WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE. WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE, THERE IS NO PAPERWORK, NO DOCUMENTATION. HAVE YOU EVER LOOKED AT MIGRATION? LOOK AT ALL OF THE YOUNG MEN. WHERE ARE THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN? TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN GERMANY. IT IS A DISASTER. WHAT IS HAPPENING TO SWEDEN, BRUSSELS. TAKE A LOOK. IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO OUR COUNTRY. WE WILL MAKE OUR COUNTRY -- WE WILL MAKE OUR COUNTRY STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. IF YOU LOOK AT OUR GDP FOR THE LAST ORDER, WE HAD NO GROWTH. WE ARE LOSING JOBS. WE HAVE A PHONY JOBS NUMBER. THEY SAY WE ARE DOWN TO 5% BUT THE REAL NUMBER IS 25%. IF IT WEREN'T, I WOULD NOT BE HAVING KRAUS LIKE THIS AT EVERY STADIUM. THAT 5% NUMBER WAS DEVISED BY POLITICIANS TO LOOK GOOD. JUST TO LOOK GOOD. THE JOBS THEY ARE TALKING THESE ARE BAD JOBS AND THE   PART-TIME JOBS ALL OVER THE PLACE. PEOPLE WORKING PART-TIME JOBS THAT NEVER HAD A PART-TIME JOB.  SO WE'RE GOING TAKE OUR JOBS   BACK THE CHINA AND ALL OF THESE  OTHER COUNTRIES. I HAVE A FRIEND, HE'S A GREAT  CONTRACTER AND MERCHANDISER, AND HE CANNOT GET HIS PRODUCT INTO CHINA. NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES, HE CAN'T. OH, BYE-BYE. GOOD JOB, FELLOWS. BYE-BYE. BUT SEE, HE'S SMILING. HE'S HAVING A GOOD TIME. I LOVE THE OLD DAYS, YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE, THERE'S A GUY TOTALLY DISRUPTIVE, THROWING PUNCHES. WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO PUNCH BACK  ANYMORE. I LOVE THE OLD DAYS. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY USED TO DO GUYS LIKE THAT IN A PLACE LIKE   THIS? THEY WOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN A   STRETCHER, FOLKS. TRUE. YOU KNOW, I LOVE OUR POLICE. AND I REALLY RESPECT OUR POLICE. AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH. THEY'RE NOT.  HONESTLY, I HATE TO SEE THAT.  HERE'S A GUY THROWING PUNCHES, NASTY AS HELL, SCREAMING AT  EVERYTHING ELSE WHEN WE'RE   TALKING AND HE'S WALKING OUT AND WE'RE NOT ALLOWED -- THE GUARDS  ARE VERY GENTLE WITH HIM.  HE'S WALKING OUT WITH BIG HIGH-FIVES, SMILING, LAUGHING. I'D LIKE TO PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE, I'LL TELL YOU.  YOU KNOW, IT BRINGS UP   SOMETHING, TWO DEBATES AGO, THEY HIT TED CRUZ WITH A QUESTION. THIS GUY'S SO OVERRATED, HE'S RIDICULOUS.  I ALWAYS SAY ABOUT TED CRUZ, HE CAN DEBATE BUT HE CAN'T TALK.  THEY SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WATERBOARDING? HE GOT ALL MESSED UP.  HE COULDN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION. HE WAS A MESS. HE DIDN'T WANT TO SAY WATERBOARDING IS A GOOD THING. WATERBOARDING -- NOTHING'S   PRETTY BUT THEY'RE CHOPPING OFF  HEADS, RIGHT?  THEY'RE CHOPPING OFF HEADS. THEY'RE DROWNING PEOPLE IN STEEL CAGES. LEAVING THEM IN THE OCEAN FOR AN HOUR AND THEN LIFTING THEM UP AFTER MANY, MANY PEOPLE DROWN. BUT THEY'RE CHOPPING OFF HEADS   AND THEY'RE SAYING TO  THEMSELVES, CAN YOU BELIEVE HOW  WEAK AND PATHETIC THE AMERICANS ARE? SO THEY'RE ASKING TED CRUZ WHAT  DO YOU THINK OF WATERBOARDING?",Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Rally in Las Vegas

I SAID TO MY WIFE, LET'S GO. LET'S DO IT. AND IT TAKES GUTS. RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT -- I NEVER DID THIS STUFF BEFORE. IT TAKES GUTS. I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WOULD HAPPEN. I THOUGHT WE DO WELL AND I  THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE THE HORSE  RACE AND I WOULD BE IN THE MIDDLE AND BY THE VERY END I'D  INCH IT OUT. I DIDN'T KNOW WE WOULD BE IN THIS POSITION. I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE GOING TO  BE IN THIS POSITION. THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE WERE UNBELIEVABLE. LAST WEEK WE WON EVERY SINGLE CATEGORY. WE WON RICH, POOR, FAT, THIN, TALL, SHORT. WE WON WOMEN. WE WON MEN. WE WON HIGHLY EDUCATED. WE WON SMART, SMART, SMART, SMART PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE BIG EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS. WE WON EVERY SINGLE CATEGORY AND IT WAS SUCH AN HONOR. THEY WERE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS, EVERY TIME I WENT AROUND TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, I  TALKED TO PEOPLE, WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST PROBLEM. THE VETS WE'LL TAKE CARE OF OUR  VETS. COMMON CORE, WE'LL END COMMON CORE 100%. GOING TO END IT. AND WE'RE BRINGING OUR EDUCATION LOCALLY. YOU'RE GOING TO EDUCATE YOUR CHILDREN LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE OLD FASHIONED WAY. NO BUREAUCRACY. YOU'LL EDUCATE THEM WITH LOVE, THE LOVE OF THE PARENTS. YOU'RE GOING TO EDUCATE THEM  LOCALLY. RIGHT? SECOND AMENDMENT. THEY TALK ABOUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT. WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT, BELIEVE ME. WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT IT. IF WE HAD GUNS IN LOS ANGELES OR FRANKLY WHERE THEY HAVE THE  TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE WORLD, IF THEY HAD GUNS ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH BULLETS ON THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE 130 PEOPLE KILLED AND MANY PEOPLE RIGHT NOW DESTROYED. THEIR LIVES ARE DESTROYED. THEY'RE LYING IN THE HOSPITAL, SOME WILL DIE. IF WE HAD THAT, I'LL TELL YOU  WHAT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 14 PEOPLE KILLED, THE 14 PEOPLE KILLED IN CALIFORNIA, IS THAT RIGHT?  IF GUNS WERE POINTED IN THE  OPPOSITE DIRECTION, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE 14. THESE ARE TWO PEOPLE THAT WERE RADICALIZED. SHE PROBABLY RADICALIZED HIM. NOBODY KNOWS. WHO CARES?  THEY WERE RADICALIZED. RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. SO THEY WERE RADICALIZED. THEY WALK INTO PEOPLE THAT GAVE  THEM A  V  WEDDING  V  RECEPTION.  V  PEOPLE  V  THAT  V  GAVE  V  THEM  V  A  V  BABY   V  SHOWER.  V  PEOPLE  V  THAT  V  THEY  V PEOPLE DRIVE THROUGH THE BORDER. LOADED UP WITH DRUGS, WE GET THE DRUGS AND THEY GET THE CASH AND  THEY DRIVE BACK. WE'RE GOING TO RUN OUR COUNTRY PROPERLY. WE'RE GOING TO RUN OUR COUNTRY PROPERLY. OBAMACARE IS A DISASTER. OBAMACARE IS GOING TO BE REPEALED AND REPLACED. A BIG PART OF THE PROBLEM WE HAVE, THE PEOPLE I'M RUNNING AGAINST AND OTHERS, POLITICIANS, IN OTHER WORDS, THEY GET FUNDS SO MUCH MONEY. JEB BUSH GETS $150 MILLION? GONE. IT'S WASTED. YOU CAN TAKE IT AND THERE'S A WINDOW HERE SOMEPLACE, LOW IT  OUT THAT WINDOW RIGHT THERE AND  IT'S GOING TO DO THE SAME AMOUNT OF GOOD AS WHAT THAT MONEY DID. OTHER THAN THESE GUYS THAT WORK FOR HIM TOOK COMMISSIONS AND  MADE A FORTUNE. THIS CAMPAIGN STUFF IS UNBELIEVABLE. THEY TOOK MONEY AND SPENT IT SO FAST BECAUSE THE GUYS THAT ARE  SPENDING THAT MONEY ARE GETTING 10%, 15% AND MAYBE EVEN 20%. SO THEY'RE SPENDING -- I'M SAYING, WHY ARE THEY DOING SO  MANY COMMERCIALS ON ME, BECAUSE  THEY GET PAID COMMISSIONS. JEB BUSH -- HE PROBABLY DOESN'T  EVEN KNOW THIS HAPPENS, OKAY? GUY DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE. THIS GUY DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE. BUT THEY SPEND THE MONEY SO FAST BECAUSE THE GUYS THAT ARE IN CHARGE, THE PEOPLE THAT BUY THE  ADS AND THE MANAGERS, ALL THESE  GUYS, THEY'RE MAKING A FORTUNE. THEY HAD ONE CASE IN THE  LOS ANGELES TIMES WHERE A  CERTAIN CANDIDATE RAISED  $6 MILLION. VERY IMPRESSIVE, RIGHT?  AFTER THE COMMISSIONS AND AFTER  ALL THE MONEY WENT BY, OUT OF THE $6 MILLION HOW MUCH WAS  LEFT?  $140,000. $140,000. $6 MILLION THEY RAISE AND  $140,000 WAS LEFT. THIS IS THE CROOKED BUSINESS,  FOLKS. SO HERE'S THE STORY. I'M SELF FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN. SELF FUNDED. I'M PUTTING MY OWN MONEY IN. AND I GUESS BY THE END OF THIS MONTH I'LL HAVE LIKE $25 MILLION IN THIS THING. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I SPENT IN  NEW HAMPSHIRE, $3 MILLION. JEB BUSH SPENT $47 MILLION. I ENDED UP IN FIRST PLACE WITH A LANDSLIDE AND JEB BUSH WAS TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF THE PACT. ISN'T THIS THE WAY WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE RUNNING OUR  COUNTRY, RIGHT? RIGHT? RIGHT?  YOU KNOW, OUT OF THE TOP 30 IN THE WORLD, MEANING 30 COUNTRIES, WE'RE NUMBER ONE IN COST PER PUPIL BY FAR. SO HIGH NUMBER TWO DOESN'T EXIST. YOU HAVE NORWAY, DENMARK,  SWEDEN, CHINA. THESE ARE THE BEST COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF EDUCATION, THESE ARE  RANKED THE TOP 4 OR 5. GREAT COUNTRIES, GREAT  EDUCATION. THEY SPENT A FRACTION OF WHAT WE DO. WE'RE NUMBER 30 OUT OF 30. SO WE'RE NUMBER 30 AND YET WE'RE NUMBER ONE IN MONEY SPENT BY  FAR. I'M TELLING YOU, THE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN 1 AND 2 IS NUMBER TWO IS SO FAR AWAY YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE IT. WE GOT TO CHANGE. WE GOT TO DO LIKE MY CAMPAIGN OF THE I SPENT THE LEAST AND I HAVE THE BEST RESULTS. WE GOT TO DO THAT. WE GOT TO DO IT. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WE  COULD DO. HERE'S ANOTHER THING. RECENTLY A DOCTOR COMES UP TO  ME, GOOD GUY. SMART GUY. ALTHOUGH HE'S GOING TO LEAVE THE PROFESSION, HE SAID. HE HAS MORE NURSES -- THINK OF IT. IN TERMS OF NURSES MORE NURSES  THAN HE EVER HAD BECAUSE HE GOT BIGGER. BUT NOW HE'S GOT MORE ACCOUNTANTS THAN HE HAS NURSES. HE SAID, THIS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. IT'S SO COMPLICATED. YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO DIE ON  ITS ON VOLITION UNLESS THE  REPUBLICANS BAIL HIM OUT. THEY'RE CONSTANTLY BAILING OBAMA OUT. IT'S GOING TO DIE. BUT THIS GUY COMES UP. GOOD GUY. HIGHLY RESPECTED. HE SAID, THE DRUG INDUSTRY, PHARMACEUTICAL PHARMACEUTICAL, WE'RE THE  LARGEST PURCHASER OF DRUGS BY  FAR. WE DON'T BID. I SAID WHAT?  WE DON'T BID THE COST OF DRUGS  OF THE WE DON'T BID IT OUT. IF WE BID IT OUT WE WOULD SAVE APPROXIMATELY $300 BILLION. 300 BILLION! SO, MY FRIEND SAID WHY IS THAT? AT FIRST IT TOOK ME ABOUT 20  SECONDS TO SAY, REALLY?  BUT THEN AS SOON AS I DID IT I REALIZED WHY. THE POLITICIANS I'M RUNNING  AGAINST AND OTHERS ARE GETTING  TREMENDOUS CAMPAIGN  CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE  PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES, THE DRUG INDUSTRY. AND THEY DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING. IF WHATEVER THAT COMPANY PAYS,  THE UNITED STATES PAYS THE  LOWEST PRICE OF ANY COMPANY BUYING DURING THAT PERIOD OR TWO YEAR PERIOD. YOU PAY THE LOWEST PRICE. AND I SAY, LOWEST PRICE LESS  10%. I'M BEING NICE WHEN I SAY 10%. WE WOULD SAVE $300 BILLION. WE DON'T IT BECAUSE THESE GUYS  ARE GETTING MONEY. WOODY JOHNSON IS THE HEAD OF  JOHNSON AND JOHNSON AND BUSH'S FUNDRAISERS. HE'S THE CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN. THINK OF IT. TED CRUZ WHO LIES MORE THAN ANY  HUMAN BEING I HAVE EVER SEEN, ANY. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY HUMAN BEING LIE. LOOK WHAT HE DID TO BEN CARSON. LOOK WHAT HE DID WITH HIS CRAZY VOTER VIOLATION. HE LIES MORE THAN HUMAN BEING. TED CRUZ, LOOK AT WHO IS GIVING HIM THE MONEY, OIL INDUSTRY AND  WALL STREET. HE DOESN'T PUT DOWN THE LOANS OR BANKS BECAUSE HE'S TELLING ALL  THE PEOPLE HE'S ROBIN HOOD AND  HE'LL PROTECT THEM FROM WALL STREET. HE'S GOING TO PROTECT THEM. HE DOESN'T SAY HE HAS A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN WITH GOLDMAN SACHS. HE DOESN'T SAY THAT THE INTEREST RATE ON THAT LOAN IS PRACTICALLY NOTHING. YOU WOULD LIKE TO  HAVE IT, BELIEVE ME. YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT. THESE PEOPLE -- IT'S ALL OF THEM. IT'S NOT JUST TED CRUZ BUT ALL OF THEM. AND THE REASON OUR COUNTRY IS  MESSED UP, ONE OF THE BIG  REASONS IS THE FACT THAT THEY'RE ALL TAKING CARE OF BY EVERY INDUSTRY. WHETHER IT'S THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY. YOU WANT TO BRING FORD BACK FROM MEXICO, THEY'LL TELL YOU WHY YOU CAN'T BECAUSE THEY GET CAMPAIGN  CONTRIBUTIONS THEY CAN'T BRING  FORD BACK. SO I'M SELF FUNDING. IF I WANT TO BRING SOMEONE BACK  I BRING THEM BACK. NO ONE WILL CALL ME AND SAY, YOU CAN'T DO IT. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. SO THE OTHER DAY I'M WATCHING TELEVISION AND I SEE SOMEBODY WITH A CELL PHONES WITH YOUR WATCH. I SEE CARRIER. I BUY AIR-CONDITIONERS FROM  CARRIER AND MANY OTHERS. I WON'T BUY FROM THEM AGAIN. THEY'RE FIRING EVERYBODY. THEY'RE FIRING THESE PEOPLE,  WHY?  BECAUSE THEY'RE MOVING TO MEXICO. OH GREAT; GREAT. HOW DOES THAT HELP US?  HOW DOES IT HELP US? THEY'RE MOVING TO MEXICO.  THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE  AIR-CONDITIONERS IN MEXICO AND  THEY'RE GOING TO SELL THEM ON  THE BORDER AND SELL THEM. BOOM. THEY'RE GOING TO SELL THEM TO THE UNITED STATES. WE GET NOTHING. WE LOSE OUR JOBS AND CLOSE OUR  FACTORIES AND MEXICO GETS ALL  THE WORK. WE GET NOTHING. NOW, YOU PROBABLY HEARD SOME OF  THESE REALLY NOT SMART PEOPLE SAY, DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A TRUE CONSERVATIVE. HE IS NOT A CONSERVATIVE. I'M VERY CONSERVATIVE. I'M THE MOST CONSERVATIVE PERSON ON THE WORLD ON THE BORDER AND  WITH RESPECT TO GETTING RID OF COMMON CORE AND THE MOST CON SERVE ACTIVE PERSON IN THE WORLD WITH GETTING RID OFWITH GETTING RID OF ]WITH GETTING RID OF ]WITH GETTING RID OF  ]OBAMACARE. I'M THE MOST CONSERVATIVE HAVING TO DO WITH OUR MILITARY AND  REBUILDING OUR MILITARY AND TAKING CARE OF OUR VETS. BUT THEY SAY, DONALD TRUMP -- I  WATCH THESE GUYS. I GET A KICK OUT OF IT. MANY OF THESE GUYS IN PRIVATE  INDUSTRY THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE  TO GET A JOB ASK THEY'RE RUNNING THE COUNTRY. BUT THEY'RE IDIOTS. BUT THINK OF IT. SO THEY'RE SAYING, HE'S AN  CONSERVATIVE. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, I  BELIEVE IN FREE TRADE. BUT IT'S GOT TO BE SMART TRADE. IT'S GOT TO BE TRADE WITH -- WITH CHINA WE'RE GOING TO LOSE  $500 BILLION. WITH JAPAN WE'RE GOING TO LOSE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. THEY SEND THEIR CARS HERE LIKE IT'S CANDY. MILLIONS OF CARS WE GET. WE SEND THEM NOTHING. WE SEND THEM SOMETIMES CATTLE. AND THEY DON'T ACCEPT IT BECAUSE THEIR FARMERS DON'T WANT ANYTHING FROM US. SO THEY SEND IT BACK.  DO NOT DONALD BEEF. JAPAN IS KILL US. LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO CATERPILLAR. A FRIEND OF MINE IS AN ESCAL SRAEUTER. HE GOES OUT AND HE BUSINESS ESSRAEUTING EQUIPMENT. THEY HAVE CUT THE END AND DEVALUED THEIR CURRENCY TO SUCH  AN EXTENT. HE'S BUYING ESKA VAGUS EQUIPMENT FROM ANOTHER PLACE. I OWE IT TO MY FAMILY AND MY WIFE AND MY EMPLOYEES AND MY  COMPANY. I UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S SAYING. THEY DEVALUED THEIR CURRENCY. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO CATERPILLAR. RIGHT HERE YOU HAVE BOEING. BOEING IS BEING FORCED TO BUILT A MASSIVE PLANT IN CHINA, A  NUMBER OF MASSIVE PLANTS. FOLKS, LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING, UNLESS I'M PRESIDENT, YOU WATCH WHAT HAPPENS. WON'T HAPPEN WITH ME BECAUSE I  KNOW THE GAME BETTER THAN ANY  HUMAN BEING THAT'S EVER LIVED. UNLESS I'M PRESIDENT, THEY'RE  GOING TO DEVALUE CURRENCY AND  NOBODY KNOWS CURRENCY MANIPULATION BETTER THAN CHINA, NOBODY. AND ALL OF A SEUPBD YOU'RESUDDEN YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, THEY'RE  GOING TO START DOING THE LAYOFFS AND HERE WE GO AGAIN OF THE WE  GOT TO GET SMART ON TRADE. WHEN I CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR AT TRUMP TOWER, IT STARTED WITH TRADE AND IT STARTED WITH THE BORDER. AND THEN THEY HAD THAT HORRIBLE  INCIDENT IN FRANCE, IN PARIS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE BORDER  BECAME MORE IMPORTANT AND CNN  DID POLLS AND IT SAID, THEY LOVE US -- THEY LOVE TRUMP FOR THE  MILITARY BECAUSE HE'S THE TOUGHEST ON THE BORDER. SHERIFF JOE ENDORSED ME. WHEN HE DOES THAT YOU'RE THE TOUGHEST ON THE BORDER. EVERY CANDIDATE GOES THROUGH  LIBERTY UNIVERSITY. HE ENDORSED TRUMP. SARA PALIN. EVERYBODY WANTS HER ENDORSEMENT. A GREAT WOMAN AND A GREAT --  I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THAT IS A  GREAT PERSON WHO ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP. WE'LL HAVE THE BORDERS AND WE'RE GOING HAVE TO OUR TRADE WHEN WE  STARTED I TALKED ABOUT BORDERS. I TALKED ABOUT TRADE. I'M REALLY GOOD AT THE TRADE. I'M REALLY GOOD AT THE BORDERS. WHEN PARIS HAPPENED, EVERYBODY  STARTED SAYING, WE WANT TRUMP. THE POLLS CAME IN. 60% AND 70% AND 72%. THIS IS 72% WITH 17 PEOPLE RUNNING. NOW WE'RE DOWN TO SIX AND WE GOT RID OF ALL THESE PEOPLE AND IT'S SO GREAT. BUT WE HAD 60% AND 70%. IN TERMS OF THE MILITARY, IN TERMS OF THE BORDER, IN TERMS OF ALL OF THESE THINGS, THE ECONOMY I EXPECT. BUT EVERYTHING WAS TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP EXCEPT PERSONALITY. I DIDN'T DO AS WELL. IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. PERSONALITY WAS A LITTLE LOWER  THAN THE ECONOMY. BUT IF YOU HAD YOUR CHOICE OF  HAVING SOMEBODY WITH A WONDERFUL PERSONALITY BUT BAD ON JOBS AND  BAD ON THE ECONOMY AND BAD ON  SECURITY AND BAD ON THE BORDER AND BAD ON THE WALL, I'LL TAKE  THE GUY WITH THE WALL AND THE ECONOMY, OKAY. BELIEVE ME. AND I'M ALSO A NICER GUY THAN  MANY OF THESE PEOPLE RUNNING. THAT I CAN TELL YOU. THEY ACTUALLY CAME UP -- OH WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL? WHAT ARE THESE GUYS RUNNING  AGAINST ME. DONALD, YOU CAN'T BUILD A WALL. I SAID REALLY?  WHY CAN'T WE?  HE SAID I DON'T KNOW. CAN DO YOU THAT? YOU KNOW 15 YEARS AGO THEY WANTED TO BUILD A WALL AND THEY COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT THEY COULDN'T GET IT APPROVED BECAUSE THIS WERE RODENTS AND SNAKES AND RATS AND ALL SORTS OF STUFF IN THE WAY AND COULDN'T  GET IT. THEY HAD FROGS AND SNAILS TRUE. GO LOOK. THEY COULDN'T GET AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT APPROVED. I'M SO GOOD AT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENTS. NOW, YOU HAVE SOUTH CHINA AND  YOU HAVE CHINA BUILDING A  MASSIVE FORTRESS WITH MASSIVE,  MASSIVE RUN RAYS FOR THE BIGGEST MAIL TERRI PLANES IN THE WORLD  AND THEY HAVE THOSE ESCAL SRAEUTKA  SRAEUTED AND THEY'RE RIPPING THE HELL OUT OF THE OCEAN AND  BUILDING AN ISLAND IN THE SOUTH  OF CHINA AND THAT HE GOING TO BE A MILITARY FORTRESS AND THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THAT  BUT THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR OUR PRESIDENT AND COUNTRY SO THEY'RE DOING IT. I SAID TO A FRIEND OF MINE FROM  CHINA BECAUSE DO I A LOT OF BUSINESS WITH CHINA. THEY'RE FINE TO DO BUSINESS WITH CHINA. IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING,  YOU CAN MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. THEY HAVE MY APARTMENTS. BIGGEST BANK IN THE WORLD. 400 MILLION CUSTOMERS. THAT'S MORE THAN THE PEOPLE WE  HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY. BIGGEST BANK IN THE WORLD. I SAID TO MY FRIEND JOKINGLY, I SAID, WHEN YOU STARTED ESKA  VAGUS AND BUILDING THAT TREMENDOUS ISLAND, DID YOU GET ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT. HE SAID NO. THEY CAME UP WITH THE IDEA ON FRIDAY AT 4 O'CLOCK AND THEY STARTED EXCAVATION ON SATURDAY  MORNING. TRUE, HE SAID THAT. HE SAID THEY CAME UP WITH IT AND THEY STARTED EXCAVATION -- WE'RE DEALING IN A DIFFERENT WORLD FOLKS. I LOVE THE LAST DEBATE. SOME PEOPLE SAID HE WAS TOO TOUGH. THAT'S BETTER THAN SOME OF THE OTHERS WHO ARE TOO WEAK. DRUDGE WHO IS AMAZING, I WON  EVERY SINGLE POLL FOR THE  DEBATE. RIGHT? BUT SOME PEOPLE SAID I WAS TOO TOUGH. I HAD SEVEN PEOPLE COMING FROM  EVERY SIDE. AM I SUPPOSED TO BE NICE?  THEY SAY, HILLARY CLINTON SAID I DON'T LIKE DONALD TRUMP'S TONE. I DON'T LIKE HIS TONE. THEY'RE CHOPPING OFF HEADS IN  THE MIDDLE EAST OF OUR PEOPLE. THEY'RE CHOPPING OFF HEADS OF  CHRISTIANS. THEY'RE CHOPPING OFF HEADS OF EVERYBODY. THEY'RE DROWNING PEOPLE 30 AT A  TIME IN CAGES AND SHE GOES, I  DON'T LIKE HIS TONE. SO THEY ASKED TED CRUZ WHO IS  STANDING RIGHT HERE -- I WAS ALWAYS IN THE SENT ARE BY THE  WAY. I'VE BEEN IN THE CENTER EVERY SINGLE DEBATE. NICE, RIGHT? NOT EASY. SOMEBODY SAID THAT'S AMAZING. EVERY SINGLE DEBATE, I HEARD TED'S A GOOD DEBATER. I SAID HERE'S A DEBATER BUT HE  CAN'T TALK. BAD TALKER. GOOD DEBATER AND BAD TALKER. THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT WATER BOARDING. AH, I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT. HE DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT WATER BOARDING. BECAUSE TOO CONTROVERSIAL. I'M SAYING, THEY'RE CHOPPING OFF HEADS AND HE DOESN'T WANT TO  TALK ABOUT. THEY LOOKED AT ME AND I DIDN'T POLL IT. I DON'T NEED A POSTER. YOU KNOW WHAT, THESE GUYS DO MY POLLING FOR ME. THE NETWORK AND EVERY DAY THEY COME OUT WITH A NEW POLL. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF DONALD  TRUMP'S HAIR. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIS THIS. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIS THAT. I LEARNED MORE ABOUT MYSELF. WHAT DO I HAVE SPEND MONEY, THEY SPEND MILLIONS ON POLLING. TWO MINUTES AFTER IT COMES OUT I GET THINGS THIS THICK, THINGS I  NEVER KNEW ABOUT MYSELF AND THEN THEY SAY, HOW MUCH DO YOU PAY YOUR POSTER. GET THEM FOR FREE. THEY DO IT FOR FREE. THEY SAY PHOUFP DO YOU PAY YOUR  POSTER MR. TRUMP. I SAY, NOTHING. I DON'T HAVE A POSTER. THE NETWORKS ARE MY POSTERS. I LEARNED A LOT. THEY SPEND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A MONTH. SO TED CRUZ COULDN'T POLL IT. HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. HE WAS MUMBLING AND BUMBLING. HE GO, WELL, I LIKE TO -- YOU  GOT TO SEE T YOU GOT TO SEE IT. THEN THEY SAY, MR. TRUMP -- I'M THINKING TO MYSELF. THEY CHOP OFF HEADS. NOT SINCE MEDIEVAL TIMES, JAMES FOLEY -- NOT SINCE MEDIEVAL  TIMES DO THEY CHOP OFF HEADS. WHO THE HELL EVER HEARD OF THIS. WE'RE IN NOW THE WORST PERIOD OF MAYBE EVER, MEDIEVAL TIMES,  BOOM, I LOVED HISTORY WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. I'D READ ABOUT MEDIEVAL TIMES. BOOM, BOOM, CHOP OFF HEADS. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HEARD ABOUT CHOPPING OFF HEADS. NOW THEY CHOP OFF HEADS. NOW THEY LOOK AT ME. MR. TRUMP, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT WATER BOARDING. THEY THINK I'M GOING TO SAY IT'S A TERRIBLE THING IT'S SO  TERRIBLE. IN FACT, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE -- THE BIG QUESTION IS, IS IT TORTURE OR NOT. IT'S LIKE YOUR MINIMAL, MINIMAL, MINIMAL TORTURE. THEY SAID, MR. TRUMP, I'D LIKE  YOU TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT WATER  BOARD SOMETHING I SAID I FEEL  GREAT ABOUT IT. I FEEL GOOD. I SAID I FEEL GREAT. AND THEN I SAID, SOMETHING THAT GOT ME IN A MINOR BIT OF TROUBLE. I SAID, BUT I THINK WE SHOULD GO MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, MUCH FURTHER THAN WATER BOARDING. I SAID WE HAVE AN ENEMY IN THE  MIDDLE EAST ISIS AND OTHERS THAT ARE CHOPPING OFF PEOPLE'S HEADS AND DROWNING PEOPLE IN STEEL CAGES. CAN YOU IMAGINE THESE PEOPLE  WHEN THEY SIT AROUND AT NIGHT  EATING, WHATEVER THEY'RE EATING, AND TALKING AND THEY'RE TALKING  ABOUT THE UNITED STATES THAT  THEY'RE ACTUALLY WORRIED ABOUT  WATER BOARDING AS BEING A LITTLE BIT CRUEL AND THESE PEOPLE CHOP  OFF HEADS. THEY MUST THINK WE'RE THE  DUMBEST AND WEAKEST AND STUPIDIEST PEOPLE ON EARTH ON EARTH ON EARTH ON EARTH! YOU KNOW, I READ A STORY IT'S A  TERRIBLE STORY BUT I'LL TELL YOU. SHE TELL YOU OR SHOULD I NOT? EARLIER IN THE CENTURY, LAST CENTURY, GENERAL PERSHING, THEY HAD A TERRORISM PROBLEM AND  THERE WAS A WHOLE THING WITH ANIMALS AND PIGS AND THEY DON'T  LIKE THAT. THEY WERE HAVING A TREMENDOUS  PROBLEM WITH TERRORISM. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU CAN READ IN THE HISTORY BOOKS. AND GENERAL PERSHING WHO WAS A  ROUGH GUY AND HE SITS ON HIS  HORSE AND VERY ASTUTE AND THE ERA WAS EARLY 1900'S. THEY WERE HAVING TERRORISM AND HE CAUGHT FIFTIER50 TERRORISTS AND HE DIPPED 50 BULLETS IN PIG'S BLOOD. AND HE HAD HIS MEN LOAD HIS  RIFLES AND HE LINED UP THE 50  PEOPLE AND THEY SHOT 49 OF THOSE PEOPLE AND THE 50TH PERSON HE  SAID, YOU GO BACK TO YOUR PEOPLE YOU AND TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED. AND FOR 25 YEARS THERE WASN'T A PROBLEM. OKAY? 25 YEARS. SO WE BETTER START GETTING TOUGH AND WE BETTER START GETTING VIGILANT AND USING OUR HEADS OR WE WON'T HAVE A COUNTRY FOLKS. I LOVE THIS COUNTRY. WE WANT TO KEEP THIS COUNTRY. WE I'VE BEEN SAYING SOMETHING  BECAUSE I'VE BEEN MEETING SO MANY PEOPLE, MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. ONE ARE THE REPORTERS SAID,  TELEVISION REPORTER SAID TO ME,  I'VE BEEN DOING THIS, MR. TRUMP -- HE DIDN'T SAY THIS ON  THE RECORD. HE SAID I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 25 YEARS. IN 25 YEARS, I HAVE NEVER, EVER, SEEN ANYTHING LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE. AMAZING. WE'RE ALL TOGETHER. WHEN YOU GO TO DALLAS OR OKLAHOMA. WHEN YOU GO TO NEW HAMPSHIRE. WHEN YOU GO TO IOWA, AND YOU GO  TO NEW YORK ANYPLACE, THE PEOPLE ARE UNBELIEVABLE. WHEN I SAY MAKE AMERICA GREAT  AGAIN, I'M ADDING WE CAN MAKE  AMERICA GREAT AGAIN ASK GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. WE HAVE SUCH INCREDIBLE POTENTIAL. WE HAVE SUCH INCREDIBLE  POTENTIAL. I WANT TO SEE THE DAY WHEN APPLE MAKES ITS PRODUCT ON OUR LAND AND NOT OVER IN CHINA. BECAUSE I'M BRINGING OUR JOBS  BACK FROM CHINA, FOLKS. WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUR JOBS  BACK FROM MEXICO. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FORD BUILT HERE AND NOT IN  MEXICO. WE'LL BRING YOUR JOBS BACK. VIETNAM IS A NEW ONE OF THE WE'LL BRING OUR JOBS BACK TO  THIS COUNTRY. WE'LL BE SO PROUD. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I WANT. WE'LL BE SO PROUD AND WE'LL HAVE A MILITARY THAT IS SO ADVANCED  AND SO WONDERFUL AND WE'LL BUY  THE RIGHT PRODUCT THAT THE  GENERALS WANT AND NOT THE POLITICIANS. YOU'RE GOING TO REMEMBER THIS EVENING. YOU'RE GOING TO SAY IN TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS OR FOUR YEARS OR  ONE YEAR, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, THAT I WAS THERE FOR AN EVENING WHERE DONALD TRUMP REPRESENTING ALL OF US MADE A SPEECH AND I VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP THE NEXT DAY AND OUR COUNTRY STARTED WINNING AGAIN. WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE. OUR COUNTRY STARTED WINNING  AGAIN. WE STARTED WINNING WITH OUR MILITARY. WE CAN'T BEAT ISIS, FOLKS. WE WON WITH OUR MILITARY. WE'LL KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF THEM. WE WON WITH OUR VETERANS. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THEM. WE WON WITH EDUCATION&WE WON  WITH THE SECOND AMENDMENT. WE WON WITH THE BORDER AND, YEAH, WE'LL HAVE A REALLY STRONG BORDER AND WE'LL HAVE PEOPLE  COME INTO OUR BORDER AND PEOPLE. THAT BIG, BEAUTIFUL DOOR RIGHT  THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WALL. BUT THEY'LL COME IN LEGALLY. THEY'LL COME IN LEGALLY. AND YOU'LL REMEMBER THIS EVENING AND REMEMBER TOMORROW BECAUSE  YOU OF TO GO OUT AND VOTE.

BUT YOU'RING ABOUT TO BE SO  PROUD OF YOUR COUNTRY. BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO START  WINNING, WINNING, WINNING AGAIN.

ANY QUESTIONS?  IT ONLY HAS TO DO WITH ME. VERY FAIR QUESTION. THERE IS NO BAD BLOOD. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS JEB BUSH HAS SPENT ABOUT $20 BILLION ON NEGATIVE ADS THAT IN MANY CASES ARE FALSE. HE HAS A LOT OF SPECIAL-INTEREST MONEY. HIS CAMPAIGN IN MY OPINION IS GOING ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE BUT HE HAS SPENT $20 MILLION ON NEGATIVE ADS ON ME. I THINK YOU WOULD DO BETTER IF HE WENT POSITIVE. THE ONLY REASON I BRING IT UP IS THAT WE HAVE TO RESPOND TO THOSE NEGATIVE ADS. NO BAD BLOOD.  TED CRUZ IS DESPERATE. I THINK HE'S A VERY UNSTABLE GUY. I THINK WE PUT OUT A RELEASE -- I THINK HE'S A VERY UNSTABLE GUY. I CAN SAY ONLY TO A MINOR EXTENT IN COMPARISON TO OTHER POLITICIANS, I HAVE NOT THEN DOING THIS LONG, I'VE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE JUNE 16 AND I'VE NEVER MET A PERSON WHO LIES MORE THAN TED CRUZ. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. HE DID IT WITH BEN CARSON, HE DID IT WITH THE VOTER VIOLATION FRAUD. HIS -- WHAT YOU GUYS DID NOT TAKE UP WAS INTERESTING. HE PICKED UP THE BEN CARSON THING WHERE HE TOLD PEOPLE BEN CARSON LEFT THE RACE AND NOW THEY HAVE CALLS THAT ARE MUCH MORE SEVERE THAN ANYTHING YOU HAD AT THE TIME, THAT BEN CARSON HAD LEFT THE RACE, SO VOTE FOR TED CRUZ. IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A VICTORY FOR TRUMP BUT THE THING YOU DIDN'T PICK UP ON WAS THE VOTER VIOLATION FRAUD HE COMMITTED. IT WAS A FRAUD HE COMMITTED. TAKE A LOOK. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY THAT LIED AS MUCH. AS A CHRISTIAN, YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO STUDY THAT. I THINK HE IS AN UNSTABLE PERSON. I WATCH HIM AND I SEE HIM. HE'S A GOOD DEBATER, BUT HE CAN'T TALK. I DON'T EVEN THINK HE'S A GOOD DEBATER -- I HEARD HE'S A GOOD DEBATER BUT I DON'T PERSONALLY SEE HE IS A GOOD DEBATER. HE IS A VERY UNSTABLE PERSON. THAT IS JUST MY OPINION.  WHEN SOMEBODY ATTACKS ME LIKE JEB, AND I WAS VERY NICE TO HIM -- HE TALKED ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS THING -- THEY WORLD TRADE CENTER CAME DOWN DURING THE REIGN OF GEORGE BUSH. IT CAME DOWN. DURING THE LIBRARY DEBATE, HE MENTIONED ABOUT HOW WE WERE SAFE. WE WERE NOT SAFE. THAT WAS THE GREATEST ATTACK IN HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. IT WAS WORSE THAN PEARL HARBOR BECAUSE WE WERE ATTACKED AS INDIVIDUALS, NOT AS THE MILITARY. THE GREATEST SINGLE ATTACK. I'M STANDING UP THERE SAYING DO I WANT TO EMBARRASS HIM -- BUT BECAUSE I'M A NICE PERSON, I DIDN'T SAY IT. BUT WHEN HE SAID IT ANOTHER TIME, I HAD TO SAY I'M SORRY, THE WORLD TRADE CENTER CAME DOWN WHICH WAS THE GREATEST ATTACK IN HISTORY ON THIS COUNTRY. YOU HAD THAT -- I THINK FEW PEOPLE WOULD SAY THE WAR IN IRAQ IS POSITIVE. YOU HAD HIM ON THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER SAYING HOW THE WAR WAS ESSENTIALLY OVER, GUESS WHAT? NOT OVER. THE WAR WITH IRAQ IS A DISASTER. THEY ARE TAKING THE OIL, THEY ARE TAKING EVERYTHING. I WAS AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ. YOU SHOULD GET SOME POINTS FOR VISION. I WAS TOTALLY AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ. I SAID WHEN THEY ARE GETTING OUT, TAKE THE OIL. HE DID NOT TAKE THE OIL. NOW IRAN HAS THE OIL AND ISIS HAS THE OIL. NOW ISIS HAS SO MUCH MONEY.  IT IS A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. I CAN ATTACK. THEY ARE ATTACKING ME ALL THE TIME. DID I ATTACK MARCO? FOR BEING A JOKE ARTIST? WHEN DID I ATTACK HIM? FOR BEING A JOKE ARTIST? WE CAN'T HAVE THAT AS A PRESIDENT, CAN WE? I DON'T THINK I ATTACKED MARCO. GO AHEAD.  HE HAS PRINTED LIES. NOT ONLY PRINTED -- WHAT HE DID WITH BEN CARSON WAS TERRIBLE. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IT WAS A TOTAL LIE AND 10 MINUTES AFTER THE ELECTION WAS OVER, THE CAUCUS, HE SAID I'M SORRY, AND BEN DID NOT ACCEPT THAT APOLOGY THE WAY I LOOK AT IT. I DON'T WANT TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE IT'S SATURDAY EVENING AND I GET A CALL -- I'M SORRY, MY STAFF DID SOMETHING. HE TALKS ABOUT ME BEING AGAINST THE SECOND AMENDMENT. I'M THE STRONGEST PERSON RUNNING IN FAVOR OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. MY SONS HAVE BEEN LONG-TERM MEMBERS OF THE NRA AND THEY ARE EXTRAORDINARY SHOTS. THE WHOLE THING IS INCREDIBLE. HE SAYS I WANT TO APPOINT LIBERAL JUDGES -- YOU JUST SAW IT. DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO APPOINT LIBERAL JUDGES. I NAMED TO JUDGES DURING THE DEBATE -- I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO NAMED TO JUDGES. IT COULD BE SOMEONE ELSE, BUT THOSE JUDGES ARE HIGHLY RESPECTED CONSERVATIVE JUDGES. THEY WOULD BE GREAT JUDGES TO APPOINT. JUST THE OPPOSITE. BUT THE ONLY WAY I CAN FIGHT IT IS ALL THE PRESS HERE. BUT MOST PEOPLE CANNOT FIGHT IT. HE IS A LIAR. HE WILL GO UP AND ABSOLUTELY LIE. HENRY, WHO IS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, WOULD SAY I CAN'T BELIEVE THE THINGS HE'S SAYING. HE JUST COMES OUT AND WHOM, BOOM, BOOM AND ABSOLUTELY LIES. I WANT THE APOLOGY BEFORE. IN MY OPINION, BASED ON WHAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM VERY TOP LAWYERS, HE DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OR EVEN RUN AS PRESIDENT. I WILL BRING THAT LAWSUIT IF HE DOES NOT APOLOGIZE. I DO QUICK. MAYBE, IF I CAN -- WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE COMING. IT WILL BE QUICK. MY SISTER WAS APPOINTED BY RONALD REAGAN. ELEVATED IN THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION. BUT SHE WAS ORIGINALLY APPOINTED BY RONALD REAGAN. >>   MY SISTER HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ME. SHE'S A FEDERAL JUDGE AT A HIGH LEVEL, THE COURT OF APPEALS. SHE WAS APPOINTED BY RONALD REAGAN, HIGHLY BRILLIANT WOMAN, KNOWN AS A BRILLIANT JUDGE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER VIEWS ARE AND I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD WANT TO TELL ME. ONE OF YOUR COHORTS WANTED TO DO A GREAT STORY AND I SAID THEY'RE GOING TO DO A GREAT STORY AND SHE SAYS I DON'T WANT ANY STORIES. SHE'S VERY MUCH LIKE ME IN THAT RESPECT. SHE IS A FEDERAL JUDGE, HIGHLY RESPECT IT AT EVERY LEVEL. CERTAINLY, WHAT HE SAID ABOUT HER WAS HORRIBLE. SHE MAY HAVE VIEWS ON CERTAIN THINGS. I DON'T WANT TO ASK HER HER VIEWS. I DON'T THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE. SHE IS A VERY SOLID PERSON AND A GREAT INTELLECT. SHE IS ACKNOWLEDGED AS BEING SO ON THE COURT. EVEN JEB WON'T GO AND SAY DONALD TRUMP IS AGAINST THE SECOND AMENDMENT OR WHATEVER. HE DOESN'T DO THAT, BUT WHAT TED CRUZ SAYS IS INCREDIBLE. I THINK HE ACTUALLY SAID IT -- DONALD TRUMP IS AGAINST THE SECOND AMENDMENT. I DID A RADIO SHOW WITH A VERY GOOD HOST AND HE SAID YOU WERE TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF OBAMA CARE. EVERY SPEECH I HAVE MADE -- WE HAVE TWO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE. HE SAID HE REALLY LIKES OBAMACARE. HOW'D DO YOU LIKE THAT? DON'T FORGET, I ONLY HAVE THREE DAYS TO FIGHT IT. I DON'T HAVE SIX MONTHS. SO WE WILL BRING A LAWSUIT IF HE DOESN'T STRAIGHTEN HIS ACT OUT. HE IS A LYING GUY -- SOME PEOPLE MISREPRESENT -- THIS GUY IS JUST A PLAIN LIAR. I FELT BETTER BECAUSE MARCO RUBIO CALLED HIM A LIAR. I FELT SO MUCH BETTER. A POLITICIAN CALLED A POLITICIAN AND NOW I CAN ACTUALLY CALL HIM A LIAR. THIS IS FOR GITMO. IT IS ORIGINALLY FOR GITMO, BUT YOU HAVEN'T ASKED THAT YET AND IT'S RIDICULOUS. WE ARE TOTALLY AGAINST IT AND IF I WIN, WE ARE MOVING IT OUT. THEY SHOULD NOT BE CLOSING GUANTANAMO BAY. THEY SHOULD NOT BE CLOSING IT IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM. AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE MOVING PEOPLE, HARDENED CRIMINALS, INTO THIS AREA. AND I WILL STOP IT. IF I DON'T STOP IT IN TERMS OF TIME, IF I WIN, THEY ARE GOING BACK. I KEEP IT OPEN. I WOULD KEEP IT OPEN, THAT'S RIGHT. WE HAVE TO BE VERY VIGILANT. WE WILL LOOK AT EVERYBODY'S CASE, CERTAINLY, AND YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE INNOCENT OF SOMETHING SUFFERING, BUT YOU HAVE SOME VERY HARDENED PEOPLE. HE'S LETTING THEM GO ONE AFTER ANOTHER. MANY OF THEM ARE GOING BACK INTO THE BATTLEFIELDS. SO WE WANT TO KEEP IT OPEN, AND THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL. HERE IS THE THING, I DON'T WANT PEOPLE COMING INTO THIS AREA. I'VE HAD PEOPLE FROM SOUTH CAROLINA CALLING ME, ASKING ME TO DO THIS PRESS CONFERENCE ABOUT GUANTANAMO BAY. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY PEOPLE COMING HERE, AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR SHOULD TAKE A STRONG STAND ON IT. EVENTUALLY THEY SHOULD. I WOULD INCREASE THE POPULATION, AS WE CAPTURE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE TERRORISTS AND THE LIKE, I WOULD ABSOLUTELY INCREASE AND I WOULD BE VERY STRONG ON IT. THE GOVERNOR HAS A LOT OF POWER THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE. FOR INSTANCE WITH THE MIGRATION. YOU HAVE PEOPLE COMING INTO THE AREA OF SOUTH CAROLINA. IF I WERE THE GOVERNOR, I WOULD NOT LET THEM COME IN. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE RULES AND REGULATIONS SAY. IT VERY, THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. I WOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT, BELIEVE ME. WE SHOULD NOT BE TAKING PEOPLE IN FROM THE MIGRATION. WE SHOULD NOT BE TAKING PEOPLE IN FROM SYRIA BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM. LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN SWEDEN AND GERMANY AND ALL THESE OTHER COUNTRIES. WE SHOULD NOT BE TAKING PEOPLE IN FROM THE MIGRATION. WE SHOULD HELP PEOPLE WITH SAFE ZONES IN SYRIA. I WILL GET THE GULF'S DATES TO PAY FOR IT. THEY ARE SMART, BUT THEY WILL PAY. AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO PAY. WE SHOULD BUILD SAFE ZONES, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING, BUT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE PEOPLE INTO THIS COUNTRY. YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA WITH TWO PEOPLE WHO GOT MARRIED THAT WERE RADICALIZED, AND IT WAS A DISASTER. THEY KILLED 14 AND PLENTY OF PEOPLE RIGHT NOW ARE LAYING IN THE HOSPITAL. WE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS AS A COUNTRY. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN GERMANY, BRUSSELS, SWEDEN THE OTHER NIGHT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAPPEN THAT. -- WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT.  I'M JUST SAYING THIS. IF YOU LOOK BACK FOR YOUR RECORDS, YOU WILL SEE THERE WAS TREMENDOUS INFORMATION AND THE CIA AND VARIOUS OTHER AGENCIES WERE NOT GETTING ALONG AND THERE WERE A LOT OF PERSONALITY CONFLICTS AND THEY ALL HATED EACH OTHER, AND WE ENDED UP WITH THE WORLD TRADE CENTER. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK, AT THE BOOK I WROTE, I MENTIONED OSAMA BIN LADEN, BECAUSE I SAW HIM A COUPLE OF TIMES AND READ ABOUT IT, AND I SAID HE IS A BAD DUDE. WE'VE BETTER DO SOMETHING ABOUT HIM. I WAS NOT EVEN IN POLITICS. I JUST ALWAYS HAVE FOUND HIM VERY INTERESTING. I SAID TO MYSELF, WE BETTER DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT GUY. IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THE CIA AND THE VARIOUS OTHER AGENCIES, AND I THINK JOHN IS NODDING, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THIS. THEY HAD TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS GETTING ALONG TOGETHER. THEY KNEW SOME BAD THINGS WERE GOING TO HAPPEN IN THEY COULD HAVE STOPPED IT. GO AHEAD. I DON'T SAY ANYTHING. HERE IS WHAT I SAY, ARE YOU READY? THE WORLD TRADE CENTER CAME DOWN DURING HIS REIGN. THE WAR WITH IRAQ WHICH STARTED THIS WHOLE THING -- THE WHOLE THING STARTS WITH THE WAR IN IRAQ. SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS A BAD GUY. ONE THING ABOUT HIM, HE KILLED TERRORISTS. NOW IRAQ IS A HARBOR FOR TERRORISTS. SADDAM HUSSEIN UNDERSTOOD AND HE KILLED TERRORIST. BAD GUYS. BUT IT'S THE PRESIDENT AND OTHER PEOPLE, AND FRANKLY OBAMA IS NO BETTER BECAUSE THE WAY HE GOT US OUT WAS A DISASTER. SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE, SHOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN OUT THE WAY WE GOT OUT. BUT IF THE PRESIDENT WENT TO THE BEACH, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF, BELIEVE ME.  WE COULD HAVE HAD GREATER VIGILANCE, BUT I WOULD NEVER SAY ANYBODY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. GIVE MY WARMEST REGARDS. ME, NO. NO, NOT REALLY.  I COMPARE IT TO BILL CLINTON. BILL CLINTON CAME OUT FOR WEEKS AGO AND HIS WIFE MADE A STATEMENT ABOUT ME HAVING TO DO WITH -- I MADE A STATEMENT ABOUT HER AND HIM. I SAID ONCE SHE MADE THAT STATEMENT AND ONCE HE WAS CAMPAIGNING, IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT BALLGAME. NOW IS THE EX-PRESIDENT IS CAMPAIGNING FOR HIS BROTHER, I THINK HE'S PROBABLY OPEN FOR GREAT SCRUTINY, MAYBE THINGS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN THOUGHT OF IN THE PAST. WHEN JEB USED HIS NAME IN THE FIRST DEBATE, I LEFT IT ALONE. BUT WHEN HE KEPT USING IT, I SAID I HAVE TO BRING IT UP. WHEN HE'S STILL TALKING ABOUT THE GREAT SAFETY WE HAD, I SAID I'M SORRY, IT'S SOME POINT WE HAVE TO BRING IT UP. THE WORLD TRADE CENTER CAME DOWN DURING YOUR BROTHERS RAIEIGN. I DON'T THINK IT CAN HURT THEM. HOW MUCH WORSE CAN HE DO? DELAY, DELAY, YES.  I DON'T BLAME OBAMA. MITCH MCCONNELL HAS TREMENDOUS POWER IN TERMS OF THE DELAY IN TERMS OF PROCEEDING, ETC. TIME IS NOT THAT LONG, 10 MONTHS, 11 MONTHS. IT'S NOT THAT MUCH. I'M NOT SAYING THAT OBAMA SHOULDN'T DO IT, I'M JUST SAYING THE REPUBLICANS SHOULD NOT ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN. I ALSO SAID THE REPUBLICAN SHOULD NOT HAVE APPROVED THE BUDGET THEY ARE PROVED -- THEY APPROVED FOR WEEKS AGO. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN VERY DISAPPOINTING. I ALWAYS SAY THAT OBAMA IS THE WORST NEGOTIATOR OF EVER SEEN WITH EVERYBODY EXCEPT THE REPUBLICANS. ",Presidential Candidate Donald Trump News Conference

ANOTHER GREAT SISTER, ELIZABETH. MY FANTASTIC BROTHER ROBERT WHO IS WATCHING RIGHT NOW WITH ANNE AMARIE. AND IT WANT TO THANK MY LATE BROTHER FRED. WHAT A FANTASTIC -- I LEARNED OF SO MUCH FROM FRED. HE TAUGHT ME MORE ABOUT EVERYTHING. A FANTASTIC GUY. I WANT TO THANK FRED. HE IS UP THERE AND LOOKING DOWN.   WE CAN GO RIGHT DOWN THE LINE, BUT WE HAVE TO START. WHAT SHE PUTS UP WITH, OH. SHE SAID RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, YOU KNOW IF YOU RUN, YOU KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO WIN? SHE SAID THAT FROM DAY ONE. SO, THANK YOU. AND DON AND VANESSA, THANK YOU SO MUCH. SHE MADE SEVEN STOPS TODAY AT THE POLLING AREAS.   THERE HE, VERY SPECIAL. AND THAT IS GERRIT JARED, A VERY SUCCESSFUL REAL ESTATE ENTREPRENEUR IN MANHATTAN, BUT HE LIKES THIS MORE THAN REAL ESTATE. AND LAURA AND ERICA, THEY WERE ALL OUT TODAY. AND WHERE IS COREY? DOES COREY HAVE A GROUND GAME, OR WHAT? BOY, DO WE HAVE A GROUND GAME? WHERE IS COREY? YOU KNOW, WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT GROUND GAMES IN ONE WEEK. AND THE ENTIRE -- AND NOBODY TAKES MORE PHONE CALLS IN A DAY THAN HOPE. THANK YOU HOPE AND COREY. THIS IS THE ENTIRE GROUP AND THE ENTIRE STAFF. AN INCREDIBLE JOB, GET OVER HERE. COME HERE.  SO, AGAIN, WE HAVE TO THANK THE CANDIDATES BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME REALLY TALENTED PEOPLE AND TO BE VICTORIOUS AGAINST SOME OF THESE PEOPLE -- EVEN IF IT IS FOR ONE WEEK, BUT BELIEVE ME, IT WILL BE FOR MANY -- BUT THEY REALLY ARE TERRIFIC. I WANTED TO CONGRATULATE THE OTHER CANDIDATES, OK? NOW THAT I GOT THAT OUT OF THE WAY. IT'S ALWAYS TOUGHT. -- ALWAYS TOUGH. THAT IS THE WAY IT IS. WE HAVE SOME REAL TALENT IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE, YEAH RIGHT. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. WHAT DO WE REALLY WANT TO THANK, RIGHT? WE WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, RIGHT? DO WE LOVE THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE? YOU KNOW, I SAID IT A YEAR AGO. I SAID, I WILL DO WELL THERE BECAUSE I AM HERE A LOT AND IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL. I LOVE IT SO MUCH AND I LOVE THE PEOPLE. AND I ACTUALLY SAID, I THINK THEY LIKE ME A LOT. ALL OF A SUDDEN WE STARTED TO GET NUMBERS IN. PEOPLE SAID, HOW COME THEY LIKE TRUMP THE MUCH? I HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS UP HERE AND THEY ARE SPECIAL, SPECIAL PEOPLE SO, NEW HAMPSHIRE, I WANT TO THANK YOU. I AM NOT GOING TO FORGET YOU. REMEMBER, YOU STARTED IT. YOU STARTED IT.   HEYOU DID START IT. YOU KNOW, WHEN I CAME OUT I HEARD THE END OF BERNIE'S SPEECH.   NO, NO. FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS TO BERNIE SANDERS. WE HAVE TO CONGRATULATE BERNIE. HE WANTS TO GIVE AWAY OUR COUNTRY, FOLKS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN. I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS GOING WITH BERNIE. WE WISH HIM A LOT OF LUCK, BUT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE ARE TO DO IT THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY. WE ARE GOING TO BEAT CHINA AND JAPAN. WE ARE GOING TO BEAT MEXICO AT TRADE. WE ARE GOING TO BEAT ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES THAT ARE TAKING SO MUCH OF OUR MONEY AWAY FROM US. ON A DAILY BASIS. IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE. WE HAVE THE GREATEST BUSINESS PEOPLE RIGHT NOW IN THE WORLD. THEY CALL ME ALL THE TIME AND WANT TO BE INVOLVED. WE HAVE POLITICAL HACKS NEGOTIATING OUR DEALS. FOR BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN ANYMORE. WE WILL USE THE FINEST BUSINESS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. WE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING SO GOOD AND SO FAST AND SO STRONG AND THE WORLD IS GOING TO RESPECT US AGAIN, BELIEVE ME.   WE'RE GOING TO -- DO WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY?   ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAUGHT ON AND IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- SELF FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN. EVERYBODY ON BOTH SIDES. AND I SAID TWO WEEKS AGO, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I SAW ALL OF THIS MONEY BEING POURED INTO COMMERCIALS AND IT IS NOT THEIR MONEY. THIS IS ON BOTH SIDES. MONEY JUST IS POURING INTO COMMERCIALS. THESE ARE SPECIAL INTERESTS, FOLKS. THESE ARE LOBBYISTS, PEOPLE WHO DON'T NECESSARILY LOVE OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN. WHEN YOU SEE THE KIND OF DEALS MADE IN OUR COUNTRY, A LOT OF THOSE DEAL ARE MADE BECAUSE THE POLITICIANS AREN'T SO STUPID. THEY ARE MAKING THEM FOR THEIR BENEFIT. WE HAVE TO STOP IT. WE ARE NOW GOING TO MAKE IT FOR YOUR BENEFIT. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THE DEALS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT IS THE WAY IT IS.   THOUGH, I LOVE THIS. LOOK AT YOU. I LOVE THESE SIGNS, THEY ARE SO IMAGINATIVE. IN A NUTSHELL, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE GREAT TRADE DEALS AND REBUILD OUR MILITARY. IT IS GOING TO BE SO BIG AND STRONG AND POWERFUL THAT NOBODY IS GOING TO MESS WITH US. BELIEVE ME, NOBODY. NOBODY. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS. WHERE IS AL? WE LOVE AL! ALRIGHT, AL. GET UP HERE IF YOU CAN. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS. THEY ARE TREATED HORRIBLY AND THEY ARE OUR GREATEST PEOPLE. OUR VETS ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND YOU REMEMBER THAT, EVERYBODY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE STRONG BORDERS AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY, BUT THEY ARE GOING TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY LEGALLY. THEY ARE GOING TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY LEGALLY. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL, IT IS GOING TO BE BUILT. IT IS NOT EVEN ""BELIEVE IT OR NOT."" IT IS NOT A DIFFICULT THING TO DO. IN NEW HAMPSHIRE YOU HAVE AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM WITH HEROIN AND DRUGS. YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT, IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL. THE FIRST THING THEY SAY TO ME IS, MR. TRUMP, PLEASE DO SOMETHING. THE KIDS ARE GETTING STUCK AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE GETTING STUCK. IT IS SO CHEAP. AND THERE IS SO MUCH OF IT. WE ARE GOING TO END IT AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. IT IS GOING TO BE OVER. WE ARE GOING TO WORK REALLY HARD TO GET THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO ADDICTED OFF THE HABIT. WE ARE GOING TO WORK TO TAKE CARE OF THE SITUATION. IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE BORDERS AGAIN AND WE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH YOU PEOPLE TO HELP YOU SOLVE THAT VERY BIG PROBLEM AND WE WILL GET IT DONE.   SO BEAUTIFUL. WHAT A GROUP OF PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, AND ON TOP OF THIS GROUP WE HAVE THOUSANDS OUTSIDE WHO CAN'T EVEN GET IN, THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE. HEALTH CARE, WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE. IT IS A TOTAL DISASTER. WE ARE REPEALING AND REPLACING OBAMACARE. IT'S GONE. WE ARE GETTING RID OF COMMON CORE. WE ARE GOING TO EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN LOCALLY. WE EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN LOCALLY. WE ARE GOING TO PRESERVE OUR VERY SACRED SECOND AMENDMENT. THERE WILL NOT BE ANYMORE CHIPPING AWAY AT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. IF WE HAD PROTECTION IN CALIFORNIA RECENTLY, AND SO MANY OTHER PLACES -- YOU CAN EVEN LOOK TO PARIS. PARIS HAS THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE WORLD. FRANCE HAS THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE WORLD. THESE ANIMALS GO IN AND START SHOOTING ONE, TWO, THREE, 130 PEOPLE WITH MANY HORRIBLY WOUNDED. HORRIBLY WOUNDED. THEY ARE RIGHT NOW IN THE HOSPITAL. IF THERE WERE BULLETS GOING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION, BELIEVE ME, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT STORY, BUT NOBODY HAD PROTECTION.   I AM GOING TO BE THE GREATEST JOBS PRESIDENT THAT GOD EVER CREATED, REMEMBER THAT.   DON'T BELIEVE THOSE PHONY NUMBERS WHEN YOU HEAR 4.9% AND 5% UNEMPLOYMENT. THE NUMBER IS PROBABLY 28% OR 29%. IT COULD BE AS HIGH AS 35%. I EVEN HEARD RECENTLY 42%. DO YOU THINK WE WOULD HAVE GATHERINGS LIKE THIS IF -- IF WE HAD 5% UNEMPLOYMENT, DO YOU REALLY THINK WE WOULD HAVE THESE GATHERINGS? FORGETTING ABOUT SECURITY, FORGETTING ABOUT ISIS -- WHICH BY THE WAY, WE ARE GOING TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS THE RIGHT WAY. SO, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THE ECONOMY. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF JOBS. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR BORDER, EVERYTHING, HEALTH CARE. IT IS GOING TO BE SO GREAT. WHAT IS IT ABOUT A OBAMACARE? PEOPLE ARE FORGETTING, BUT NOW THEY ARE MISERABLE BECAUSE OBAMACARE IS GOING UP 35%, 45%, 50%. IT IS TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL AND PROBABLY THINKS OF ITS OWN VOLITION IN 2017. WHAT IS GOING ON? THE LAST BUDGET THAT WAS APPROVED IS AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER FOR EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE OWE $19 TRILLION AS OF TODAY. WE JUST CROSSED THE $19 TRILLION MARK. WE ARE GOING TO VERY SHORTLY BE AT $21 TRILLION BECAUSE OF THE BUDGET. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SO STRONG. WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN. WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE AS A COUNTRY. WE DON'T WIN ON TRADE, WITH THE MILITARY, AND WE CAN'T BEAT ISIS. WE DON'T WIN WITH ANYTHING. WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH. YOU ARE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA SO GREAT AGAIN, MABYE GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. I LOVE YOU ALL. THANK YOU, NEW HAMPSHIRE! THANK YOU, NEW HAMPSHIRE!   THANK YOU! WE ARE GOING NOW TO SOUTH CAROLINA. WE ARE GOING TO WIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA. I LOVE YOU ALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.    YOU SAY YOU WANT A REVOLUTION  ",Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Primary Night Speech

EASTERN TIME AND YOU COULD JOIN THE CONVERSATION LIVE ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP HELD A RALLY IN LONDONDERRY, -- IN  MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE. HE TALKED ABOUT BORDER CONTROL  AND HIS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE RIVALS.  MR. TRUMP: THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE, THIS IS A AMAZING. WE ARE COMING TO AN END OF A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL JOURNEY. WHAT EFFECT WILL THE STEP HAVE? WILL IT HAVE AN EFFECT? IT CAN HAVE AN EFFECT. WE WILL HANDLE THE SNOW. IT IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING SPECIAL TAMARA, IT IS A VERY BIG DAY FOR THE NATION AND IT IS GOING TO BE A VOTE THAT I THINK PEOPLE, IF I CAN BELIEVE WHAT I'M READING, WE WILL DO WELL. WHAT YOU THINK? ARE WE GOING TO DO WELL AND MAKE  AMERICA GREAT AGAIN? MY GOD, HUH? I SAW L TODAY ON TELEVISION. THERE IS NO ONE WHO LOVES THE VETS MORE THAN AL, HUH? AL GOES TO THE SPEECHES OF MANY OF THE CANDIDATES, ALL OF THE CANDIDATES, ESSENTIALLY. HE SETTLED WITH TRUCK AIKENS I  KNOW THE ISSUES. IT SEEMS LIKE -- HE SETTLED WITH TRUMP BECAUSE I KNOW THE ISSUES. THE VETERANS HAVE BEEN SO BADLY TREATED. AL, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF FUN AND TAKE CARE OF A LOT OF PEOPLE.  THEY ARE OUR GREATEST PEOPLE. WE HAVE A ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE BETTER TAKING CARE OF THAN OUR VETERANS. IT IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING. WE ARE GOING TO STOP THE  CRAZINESS IN TERMS OF TRADE. WE ARE CHANGE SO MUCH IN TERMS OF PURCHASING. YOU KNOW, WHEN OUR COUNTRY PURCHASES DRUG, WE ARE THE LARGEST PRESCRIPTION DRUG PURCHASER AND THE WORLD.  WE BARELY EVEN NEGOTIATE WITH  THE DRUG COMPANIES. THE REASON IS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE I AM RUNNING AGAINST ARE ALL GETTING MONEY FROM THE DRUG COMPANIES. I AM THE ONLY ONE NOT GETTING MONEY.  I AM SELF-FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN. I AM THE ONLY ONE ON EITHER SIDE.   THANK YOU. I WONDER, DOES IT MAKE A  DIFFERENCE? SOME PEOPLE DO NOT EVEN KNOW. WHEN RUDI JOHNSON, IT IS AN  EXAMPLE OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON, IS  FUNDING JEB BUSH, JEB BUSH IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE. THIS IS A GUY WHO IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE. A TOTAL STEP. HE SPENT 110 MILLION DOLLARS AND HE IS GOING NOWHERE. -- A TOTAL STIFF. HE SPENT $110 MILLION AND HE IS GOING NOWHERE.  BUT RUDI JOHNSON? JEB WHO? HE CANNOT WIN A FOOTBALL GAME.  HE HAS A NICE GUY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT AND SEE  WHAT IS HAPPENING, HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SAVINGS  IF WE MAKE A FAVORED NATIONS CAUSE IF WE DO ANYTHING. THAT IS ONE OF MANY. THERE IS SO MUCH FAT IN THIS BUDGET, SO MUCH THAT IN THE WAY WE PURCHASE. WE ARE BORN TO DO MUCH BETTER THAN EVEN I HAVE BEEN SAYING. I AM TELLING YOU. ONE OF THE THINGS WITH NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT AMAZES ME BECAUSE YOU COME THROUGH THIS I TELL ETC. AND. BEAUTIFUL TREES, BEAUTIFUL ROSE WINDING UP TO THE HILLS LIKE WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. AND I SAY, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. AND YET, EVERY TIME I AM WITH THE FOLKS FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE, I HAVE BEEN HERE LONG BEFORE THE POLITICAL STUFF SO I KNOW NEW HAMPSHIRE VERY WELL.  I LOVE THE PEOPLE. THEY ARE AMAZING. THANK YOU, HONEY. WHO SAID THAT? THANK YOU. I KNOW SHE IS VOTING. THINK YOU, DEAR. IT AMAZES ME. HEROIN. A DRUG PROBLEM. I DON'T SEE IT WITH NEW  HAMPSHIRE, BUT THE PEOPLE WITH NEW HAMPSHIRE, THE FIRST QUESTION I GET IS, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THE DRUG PROBLEM?  WHO IS BETTER THAN ME ON THE BORDER? I AM TALKING COUNTRY-WISE. THEY ARE POURING, POURING, POURING THROUGH. WE ARE BORN TO BUILD A WALL. YOU KNOW THAT.  MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY. THESE OTHER GUYS DO NOT EVEN  UNDERSTAND. SIX MONTHS AGO THEY SAID, WOODY  MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD WALL? YOU CAN'T BUILD WELL. THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA IS 13,000 MILES.  BY THE WAY, THAT IS A SERIOUS WALL.  13,000. THIS IS 2000, BUT WE NEED 1000.  THERE ARE A LOT OF NATURAL BARRIERS. RATE BARRIERS -- GREAT BARRIERS.  AND WE WILL USE CATERPILLAR, NOT THE JAPANESE COMPANY.  WE WILL HAVE A REAL BORDER. PEOPLE CAN COME INTO THE COUNTRY BUT THEY HAVE TO COME AND LEGALLY. THAT BORDER IS VERY IMPORTANT. IMMIGRATION IS SO IMPORTANT.  LOOK AT ISIS. JUST BEFORE I GOT HERE, A BIG ATTACK IN EUROPE WHERE THEY HAVE MANY PEOPLE FROM ISIS ATTACKING IN GERMANY. I JUST STARTED A FEW SECONDS AGO. I WAS ON MICHELLE SHOW IN A INTERRUPTED ME FOR THIS ATTACK AND I SAID, WOW. THAT'S BAD. IT'S AN ATTACK. IT'S PRETTY BAD. IT IS ISIS. SUPPOSEDLY IT IS ISIS. JUST HAPPEN TO MINUTES AGO ON CNN.  IT'S ISIS. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IN YOUR. WE CAN DO THIS ANYMORE. THEY WANT TO LET THESE PEOPLE COME IN, WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY'RE FROM. IMMIGRATION? I HAVE A BIGGER HEART THAN  ANYBODY WILL STOP WE HAVE TO BE SMART. IT COULD BE IN CHARGE OF HORSE. LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN GERMANY. LOOK AT SWEDEN LAST WEEK. SWEDEN. A REVOLUTION. WHOEVER HEARD OF THIS IN SWEDEN. TREMENDOUS CRIME TREMENDOUS CRIMES. WE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS, FOLKS. WE'LL GET A SAFE ZONE.  I WILL GET THE GULF STATE TO PAY  FOR IT. WE HAVE $19 TRILLION, LIKE A BUSINESS. IF YOU HAD A BUSINESS YOU AND SAY THE SAME THING. ONE I PREFER THAT.  WE JUST MADE A DEAL WITH IRAN. 150 MY IN DOLLARS. I WOULD'VE SAID, WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. SORRY.  CAN'T DO IT DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. NOT BEEN A DO IT ANYMORE. NOT CAN BE THE SUPER PEOPLE ANYMORE -- THE PEOPLE ANYMORE. WE GOING TO HAVE THE GREATEST BUSINESS IN THE WORLD RIGHT HERE. CARL ICAHN ONE OF THE GREATS,  JUST ENDORSEMENT. OTHER PEOPLE ARE ENDORSING ME. THEY ALL WANT TO ENDORSE ME. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THESE BUSINESS LEADERS NEGOTIATE OUR DEALS WITH CHINA, WITH JAPAN. JAPAN, CARS CARS CARS BY THE MILLIONS. WE HAVE TO BALANCE. WE HAVE TO FREE-TRADE. I AM A FREE TRADER, 100%. BUT WE HAVE TO THEIR TRAINED AND SMART TRADE. LAST YEAR WAS 505 BILLION DOLLARS. WITH CHINA. ONE COUNTRY. OK? TRADE IMBALANCE. WE ARE LOSING A FORTUNE. WE CAN'T DO IT. WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE NEGOTIATING. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE POLITICAL HACK.  WE HAVE ASKED NEGOTIATING. WE HAVE GREAT ORDERS WE WILL HAVE STRONG BORDERS WE'RE CAN BE CAREFUL WHO WE LET INTO THE COUNTRY.  WE CAN LET PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO COST TROUBLE. I CAME IN, WHEN I ANNOUNCED ON  JUNE 16 I WENT DOWN AND THE STAIRS AND TRUMP TOWER, JUST LIKE THE ACADEMY AWARDS. I STARTED TALKING ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND EVERYONE WENT CRAZY. TWO WEEKS LATER, EVERYBODY STARTED SAYING MAYBE TRUMP HAS A  POINT. FOUR WEEKS LATER THEY STARTED COMING TO ME AND SAYING, WELL WE ARE JUST LIKE THEM. BUT WE AREN'T. SARAH PALIN ENDORSED ME, SURE JOE ENDORSE ME. -- SHERIFF JOE ENDORSED ME. OVER THE LAST WEEK OR SO, I HAVE BEEN TO HEARING WE'RE GOING TO BUILD WALL. I SAID, WELL, AND MY WIFE SAID IT TO ME LAST WEEK, SHE SAID, I GOVERNORS SAYING WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A WALL.  AND MY WIFE KEPT SAYING, DID HE JUST SAY WE'RE GOING TO THE WALL? FIRST TIME I HEAR THAT. NO LOOK, THESE ARE POLITICIANS. JEB BUSH IS A TOTAL LIGHTWEIGHT. I HEARD HIM SAY, MARCO RUBIO IS  A VERY VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE. I SAID, HE IS NOT A FRIEND OF YOURS. HE TOO. WHAT IS SAFE TO SAY HE HAS A FRIEND OF MINE? HE JUST SAID IT ON WHAT WAS HER. HE'S A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE. THIS IS POLITICAL STUFF, FOLKS, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF IT. WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF IT.  NOT FRIENDS. THEY LIVE. THEY LIE SO MUCH IT IS  INCREDIBLE. WE HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM THESE POLITICIANS AND BRING SANITY TO THIS COUNTRY. THE NICE PART ABOUT ME IS BECAUSE I'M NOT BEING TAKING CARE OF BY THE ALL COMPANIES, AND THE DRUG COMPANIES, THE OTHER COMPANIES, THE COMPANIES. YOU HAVE COMPANIES AND COUNTRIES . THAT DEBATE THE OTHER NIGHT, EVERYBODY DID SAY I WON, BUT I  WON'T SAY THAT. TIME MAGAZINE DID A POLL. AND I HAVE ZERO INFLUENCE OVER  TIME MAGAZINE, RIGHT?  ALMOST 70% SET I WON THE DEBATE. NEXT WAS SIX OR 7%. BUT NO, I LOVE DOING IT. I LISTENED TO THE WHOLE THING. I HAD TO POINT OUT TO THE AUDIENCE, THE CROWD WAS ALL DONORS. IN FACT, I NEEDED SOME TICKETS SO WE CALLED THE RNC AND HE SAID, I'M SORRY WE DON'T HAVE ANY. THEY WERE ALL BOUGHT UP BY THE DONORS. THEY ALSO -- THEY ACTUALLY MEANT THE DONORS, SPECIAL INTERESTS, AND LOBBYISTS.  I SAID, THAT'S NOT FAIR OF ME ONLY WHEN THE DOZEN OF MANY DONORS. THE ROOM WAS PACKED. I HAD A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, MOST OF WHOM WERE DONORS TO THE OTHER GUYS. PEOPLE WOULD SAY SOMETHING THAT WAS NOTHING AND YOU WOULD HEAR CLAPPING.  BECAUSE THEY ARE DESPERATE TO HAVE THESE PEOPLE ELECTED.  SO IT WAS SORT OF FUNNY. WHO ELSE WOULD POINT IT OUT? I SAID, THIS ROOM IS PACKED WITH DONOR. I SENT IT BECAUSE IF I WON THE DEBATE, AND I THINK I DID, I KNOW THE POINTS LIKE ANYBODY ELSE. BUT WHEN PEOPLE SAY THINGS THAT ARE BATTED THEY GET APPLAUSE THEY ONLY GET APPLAUSE BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER YOUR FEDERAL, LOCAL, NATIONAL POLITICIANS. I WILL TELL YOU WE GOING TO  CHANGE IT AROUND. WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT UP WELL. WE HAVE BIG DAY COMING UP TOMORROW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. I WANT YOUR MONEY COME A LOT OF  THESE PEOPLE COME IN AND ASK FOR MONEY. I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY I DON'T NEED ANY MONEY I BUILT A GREAT COMPANY. I HAVE SOME OF THE GREATEST  ASSETS AND THE WHOLE WORLD. NOTE THAT. THAT'S THE KIND OF THINKING WE NEED TO THIS COUNTRY. ENOUGH OF THESE DO BUT PEOPLE. THAT'S THE KIND OF THINKING WE'D  NEED IN THIS COUNTRY. IT TAKES GUTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT WILL STOP WHAT I WAS COMING DOWN THE ESCALATOR I TOOK A DEEP BREATH AND SAID TO MY WIFE, LET'S GO. I TOOK A DEEP, DEEP BREATH. I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE. I WENT TO BED. I'M ENJOYING IT. BUT WE HAVE TO BRING SANITY. I'M NOT DOING IT BECAUSE OF  THAT, AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU PEOPLE.  WE COULD BE SOMEPLACE ELSE. THE FACT IS, I LOVE THE END RESULT OF WHAT THIS IS GOING TO BE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PHENOMENAL, STRONG, POWERFUL, RICH COUNTRY AGAIN.   A WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND SAID, MR. TRUMP I'M SUPPORTING YOU AND I REALLY LIKE  YOU, BUT I DON'T LIKE WHEN YOU SAY YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY RICH.  I SAID, HONEY I CAN'T HELP BUT. IF WE DON'T MAKE IT RICH, WE CANNOT MAKE IT GREAT. WE NEED MONEY. WE ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN A PERSON, NO DIFFERENT THAN A COMPANY, WE NEED TO BE RICH.  WE ARE BEING DRAINED BY ALL OF THESE DEVALUATIONS AND OTHER COUNTRIES RUN BY SMARTER PEOPLE THAN OUR PEOPLE. SMARTER AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME INFLUENCE. THEY ARE INFLUENCED BY MONEY. WHEN YOU SEE A GUY LIKE JEB IS, A LESS THAN AVERAGE GUY HAVING ALL OF THIS MONEY WHERE THEY GIVE HIM $128 BILLION WASTE AND THEN HE TAKES OUT ADS AGAINST ME, I THINK HE SPENT $25 MILLION  ON NEGATIVE ADS AGAINST ME AND MY POLL NUMBERS WENT UP. -- THEY GAVE HIM $128 MILLION. ALL THE THINGS THAT I SAY, HE SAYS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. I JUST SPOKE WITH LARRY, THE GREAT ECONOMIST, AND HE WAS SAYING, TRUMP AS THE BIGGEST TAX CUT. THEN I HAVE A POLITICIAN, THE  SKY ON TELEVISION SAYING I WANT TO RAISE TAXES FALLS AND I DON'T LIKE THE SECOND AMENDMENT. I AM THE STRONGEST PERSON ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT THAT EXISTS OF THESE CANDIDATES. NOT EVEN CLOSE. WHEN YOU HEAR A GUY TALKING ABOUT, HE WANTS TO DO ALL TO THE  SECOND AMENDMENT, THESE ARE LYING, BAD PEOPLE. WE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE SPECTACULAR AND YOU ARE GOING TO HE THERE AND THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL GROUP OF PEOPLE. AND THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO DO A DO-OVER. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I COULD NOT GET THE PLANE IN AND I TOOK A LITTLE FOR THAT. I SAID, I DON'T CARE IF I HAVE TO COME THROUGH THE YUKON. AND I THOUGHT, WHAT WE WILL DO IS TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS.  ANY QUESTIONS? GO HEAD. YOU HAVE A QUESTION? YES? GO AHEAD. OK? I KNOW THAT.  VERY POWERFUL.  BRING OUR JOBS BACK . I PASSED SOME OF THE OLD  FACTORIES. SENIOR CITIZEN HOUSING AT  DIFFERENT HOUSING. THE HOUSING IS ALL GREAT AND THE CEDARS CITIZENS AND STUFF, BUT WE NEED JOBS. THEY USED TO BE BOOMING AND NOW THEY ARE EMPTY OR THEY WERE CONVERTED INTO, IN MANY CASES, SENIOR CITIZEN HOUSING. WE NEED JOBS. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED. THE JOBS HAVE GONE TO MEXICO. FOR THIS AREA, WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH MEXICO, WITH PEOPLE WHO DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DONE WITH  TRADE AGREEMENTS, IT IS INCREDIBLE. I AM GOING TO BRING THE JOBS  BACK. ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. WE LEFT THE COUNTRY. I WANT THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY TO COME BACK INTO MICHIGAN. FORTIS BUILDING A 2.5 ELLIOTT AND PLANT IN MEXICO.  RIDICULOUS. THEY WILL SELL THE CARS INTO THIS COUNTRY WITH NO TAX, NO NOTHING. HOW DOES IT HELP US WHEN YOUR DAY IS BUILDING THIS PLANT? 2.5 BILLION, THINK ABOUT IT. A ONE-STORY BUILDING. TO KNOW HOW BIG THIS THING IS? THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF CARS AND TRUCKS AND PARTS.  HOW DOES IT HELP US? HOW DOES IT HELP US THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE THESE CAR AND SELL MANY OF THEM INTO THE UNITED STATES ALONG WITH TRUCKS AND PARTS? WHERE IS IT GOOD FOR US? YOU KNOW THEY CLOSED FACTORIES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I WENT TO THE WHARTON SCHOOL OF. WHETHER YOU WENT TO SCHOOL OR NOT, IT IS NO GOOD. I TELL PEOPLE ALL THE TIME, IF YOU ARE GOING TO GO THERE, WE WILL CHARGE YOU TAX. LEAVE IS, BUILD A PLANT, MAY CARS, SELL THEM BACK, YOU WILL PAY THE TAX. IF WE DO THAT, THEY ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.  100% WILL STAY RIGHT HERE. SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS, HERE YOU ARE DOING A GOOD JOB. UNFORTUNATELY, 99% OF THE COUNTRY HAS GOT PROBLEMS. WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THE 5%  UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, IT IS SAD THAT THEY CAN EVEN GET AWAY WITH IT, SOME PEOPLE THINK IT IS 42%. SO MANY HAVE GIVEN UP LOOKING FOR A JOB. I GO TO DALLAS, I HAVE 20,000 PEOPLE FILLING OUT MY ARENA. TONIGHT, YOU ARE ALL INVITED. WHO IS GOING? I HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO GO. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN AMAZING EVENT THERE TONIGHT WILL STOP AGAIN, THE SNOW.  BUT IT WILL STILL BE A GREAT EVENT. DON'T GO TONIGHT IF IT IS GOING TO HOLD BACK YOUR VOTE TOMORROW. TOMORROW IS MORE IMPORTANT.   WHEN I GET THESE MASSIVE PEOPLE, MOST OF THEM RECENTLY AND MOBILE, ALABAMA. WHEN I GET ALL THESE PEOPLE, IT IS BECAUSE OF WHERE WE ARE. THE STOCK MARKET IS DOWN TODAY ALMOST 300 50 POINTS. ANYBODY GETTING KILLED WITH YOUR MONEY? IT WILL COME BACK. LET ME GET IN THERE. WE HAVE TO GET IT UP. THE STOCK MARKET IS ABSOLUTELY BEING KILLED. WHAT IS IT? THREE 84.  A BIG KID.  THE STOCK MARKET IS THE WORST IN ITS HISTORY FOR THE FIRST MONTH. THE FIRST. . LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. THE STOCK MARKET WAS GOOD, EVERYTHING ELSE BAD. I SAID, DON'T WORRY, THE STOCK BUCKET WILL FOLLOW.  I DON'T KNOW WHO HE  IS. NEVER HEARD OF HIM. WHO IS IT? I WOULD CERTAINLY RETURN IT IF YOU THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE. I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM. I HAVE? I WOULD RETURN IT. DO NOT BE SO ANGRY. I DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHO HE IS.   WHO THE HELL IS HE? I DON'T KNOW.  MY SONS ARE HUNTERS, THEY LOVE HUNTING. THEY KNOW ABOUT YOUR MOOSE AIR. WERE TELLING ME ABOUT THAT. IS THAT MOSTLY DISEASE?  OR IS IT FROM HUNTING?   WOW. UNBELIEVABLE. DOWN 50%? WELL.  AMAZING. INCREDIBLE.  I SUPPORT THE DEATH PENALTY. I HAVE TO BE A LITTLE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT. IF SOMEBODY KILL SOMEBODY, I  SUPPORT THE DEATH PENALTY AND I SUPPORT THE DEATH PENALTY FOR POLICEMAN THAT GET KILLED. WE HAD A CASE OF NEW YORK, THEY  GONE TO THE CAR, AND THEY PUT A GUN TO THE OFFICER SAID, THEY PULL THE TRIGGER.  DEATH PENALTY ALL THE WAY. I HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED THE DEATH PENALTY.  I DO NOT BELIEVE PEOPLE WHO DON'T. YOU HAVE CASES TO WHO ARE SO EGREGIOUS, A GUY COMES UP TO AN  85-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, I JUST THE  FACE, SHOOTS HER AND HAD, RAPES HER, KILLS HER, AND THEN THEY PUT THEM IN JAIL FOR 25 YEARS. HOW YOU CAN EVEN THINK OF THAT -- AND I HAVE FRIENDS THAT ARE GOOD PEOPLE AND THEY SAY, NO IT IS CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT. WHAT IS THAT? IT'S LIKE THE OTHER DAY DURING THE DEBATE TALKS ABOUT THE WHOLE THING WITH WATERBOARDING. THEY SAID, TO ACTUALLY TED CRUZ, GOOD GUY, THERE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT AND YOU COULD SEE HE WAS HEDGING HE DID NOT WANT TO GET INVOLVED TOO MUCH. YOU CAN SEE IT. I UNDERSTAND. BECAUSE MAYBE IT IS POLITICALLY INCORRECT TO TALK ABOUT WATERBOARDING.  IT IS SORT OF A MINIMAL FORM. AND THEN THEY SAID, WILL, WHAT DO YOU THINK, AND I SAID I AM TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF WATERBOARDING, BUT I AM ALSO IN FAVOR OF FAR WORSE THAN  WATERBOARDING BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE CHOPPING OFF THE HEADS OF OUR PEOPLE.   AND I DON'T KNOW,  MAYBE I LOSE VOTES IF I SAY THAT. I DON'T REALLY CARE.  YOU'VE GOT A BE YOURSELF. I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS I DO THAT, I DO NOT HAVE POLLSTERS.  WHEN BUSH WAS ASKED A QUESTION WHEN HE FIRST STARTED ABOUT IS THE WORD GOOD. I AM VERY MILITARISTIC. OUR MILITARY IS GOING TO BE SO BIG, SO STRONG, SO POWERFUL, NO ONE IS GOING TO WANT TO MESS WITH US, AND I DO NOT WANT TO USE IT, BUT PEOPLE SAID, IS THE WAR IN IRAQ GOOD OR BAD? AND HE SAID, I DON'T KNOW.  HE WENT BACK AND FORTH. THIS IS A GOD WHO IS AESTHETIC, AND THEN FINALLY, THE POLLSTERS TOLD HIM WHAT TO SAY, AND HE SAID IT WAS BAD.  OF COURSE IT WAS BAD. WE SPENT $2 TRILLION, THOUSANDS OF LIVES, WOUNDED WARRIORS, WHO  I LOVE ALL OVER THE PLACE, AND NOW IRAN IS TAKING OVER IRAQ, AND NOT BECAUSE THEY WON YEMEN. THEY WILL GO OVER AND TAKE OVER SAUDI ARABIA, AND SAUDI ARABIA, WE PAY RENT. WE PAY RENT AND SAUDI ARABIA. I LIKE THE SAUDI'S. I DO BUSINESS WITH THEM. THEY ARE GREAT.  WHY ARE WE PAYING RENT?  THEY WERE MAKING $1 BILLION A  DAY, SO NOW THEY ARE MAKING HALF.  WE PROTECT THEM.  THEY SHOULD PAY A LOT OF MONEY.  SOUTH KOREA WE PROTECT.  WE HAVE 28,000 SOLDIERS IN SOUTH KOREA.  I ORDERED THOUSANDS AND  THOUSANDS OF AIR CONDITIONERS  AND TELEVISIONS, AND THEY ALL COME THROUGH SOUTH KOREA.  THEY MAKE A FORTUNE. THEY ARE BEHEMOTH. SO WHEN NORTH KOREA ACTS UP, WE  START WITH THE SHIPS, THIS, THAT, WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT THEM.  WHAT DO WE GET?  A FRACTION.  I HAVE BUILDINGS IN SOUTH KOREA, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? WE HAVE GOT TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. WE ARE NOT A NATION WHO HAS TO DO THIS.  WE PROTECT GERMANY. NOBODY EVEN KNOWS THAT. WE PROTECT, AS AN EXAMPLE,  JAPAN. WE HAVE A TREATY WITH JAPAN. IF JAPAN GETS ATTACKED, WE HAVE TO GO TO THEIR DEFENSE AND START WORLD WORD THREE, RIGHT? IF WE GET ATTACKED, JAPAN DOES NOT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. THESE ARE THE DEALS THAT WE HAVE. IF WE GET ATTACKED, THEY GO, SORRY YOU GOT ATTACKED. BYE-BYE, HAVE FUN. WE HAVE TO GO TO WAR IF THEY GET ATTACKED. THESE DEALS ARE MADE BY POLITICIANS. THEY HAVE PEOPLE IN JAPAN THAT THEY CARE ABOUT THROUGH THE LOBBYIST, THROUGH THE SPECIAL INTERESTS, THEY HAVE A LOT OF INDUSTRY. THOSE DAYS ARE GONE. IF I GET IN, YOU WILL BE SO PROUD OF OUR COUNTRY, AND WE ARE USING THE SMARTEST PEOPLE. WE WILL NOT USE THE DUMBEST. WE WILL USE THE GREAT GENIUSES. MANY HAVE BUILT FORTUNES, AND THEY DO NOT WANT ANY MONEY. YOU LOOK LIKE A TOUGH GUY EVEN WITH THAT LEG. YOU LOOK LIKE A TOUGH COOKIE.  I WOULD NOT MESS AROUND WITH YOU EVEN IF I DID NOT HAVE THAT.  SO WE HAVE TO GET SMART, AND WE  HAVE TO GET TOUGH, AND WE HAVE  TO BE VIGILANT.  YOU KNOW, WHEN I TALKED ABOUT  THE MUSLIMS, WE TALK ABOUT  ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND MEXICO,  AND THEN I TALKED ABOUT THE  MUSLIMS. EVERYBODY WANTED TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL NOT TALK ABOUT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM.  HE WILL NOT TALK ABOUT IT. HE WILL NOT MENTION IT.  WHEN IT IS 100%, LIKE IN PARIS, AND LIKE IN CALIFORNIA, PEOPLE  KILLED, 100%. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL NOT TALK ABOUT IT. IF YOU CANNOT USE THE NAME, YOU CANNOT SOLVE IT, SO I SAID WE HAVE TO HAVE A MORATORIUM.  WE HAVE TO HAVE A BAN ON UNTIL WE FIND OUT WHAT IS GOING ON. IT IS TEMPORARY AND ALL OF THAT. THERE IS HATRED OUT THERE. I TOOK A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HATE, AND NOW EVERYONE IS  SAYING, TRUMP IS RIGHT.  LOOK AT SWEDEN.  LOOK AT THESE PLACES ARE YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD, SO I WILL TELL YOU WE HAVE TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT, AND IN MY CASE, I WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.  I DO NOT GO TO A POLLSTER AND  SAY COULD YOU TELL ME HOW IT  WOULD BE IF I TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM?  I DID NOT SAY TO A POLLSTER THAT  THESE PEOPLE, THESE VERY IN MANY  CASES NOT SMART PEOPLE, THEY PAY SO MUCH MONEY -- THEY CANNOT  FUNCTION WITHOUT A POLLSTER. THEY CANNOT FUNCTION.  EVERYTHING IS POLLED. I HAVE MUCH MORE MONEY THAN THEM, BUT I DO NOT HAVE A POLLSTER.  MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN HERE  UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TRUTH IS,  AND THEY GET IT.  IF IT MEANS I LOSE BECAUSE I SAY  TRUTH, I WOULD RATHER LOSE. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? YES. GO AHEAD.  DID YOU LIKE WHAT I HAD TO SAY?  BEAUTIFUL. BEAUTIFUL.  SO WHAT HAPPENED? HE HAD THE PRESCRIPTION?  NO, I CAN SEE THAT, AND THE LOVE OF YOUR SON IS  INCREDIBLE, AND YOU SHOULD WANT TO.  I WOULD BE IN THE SAME POSITION. I UNDERSTAND.  I WOULD DO THAT IN TWO SECONDS.  NO, BECAUSE I SEE THE PASSION, YOU ARE RIGHT, AND IT IS THINGS -- THEY START ON HEROIN BECAUSE  IT IS SO CHEAP.  THERE IS SOME MUCH OF IT. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE FROM HERE, THEY SAY HOW CHEAP IT IS. AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM. IT IS SO CHEAP AND IT IS SO READILY AVAILABLE THE EVERYBODY STARTS THERE. THAT IS WHERE IT STARTS. FRANKLY, A LOT OF TIMES THAT IS WHERE IT IS. WHEN I SAY A ""POLITICIAN,"" I SAY I HATE CALLING MYSELF A  POLITICIAN BECAUSE I KNOW THE  POLITICIANS WELL, AND I USUALLY DO NOT EVEN SAY THE WORD POLITICIAN BECAUSE I DO NOT LIKE  CALLING MYSELF A POLITICIAN. I GUESS OVER THE PAST SIX OR  SEVEN MONTHS, YOU COULD CALL THE  A POLITICIAN, BUT I HATE CALLING MYSELF THAT.  YES, GO AHEAD.  UNBELIEVABLE. OF THE 6000, ALMOST EVERY SINGLE  ONE OF THEM WILL BE BACK SELLING DRUGS.  OK? THESE PEOPLES ARE OUR BABIES THAT THINK DIFFERENTLY. THEY JUST DO NOT CARE. FRANKLY, I DO NOT EVEN THINK  THEY CARE. IT IS ALMOST LIKE THEY DO NOT LIKE OUR COUNTRY.  BUT OUT OF THE 6000, EVERY  SINGLE ONE WILL BE BACK SELLING DRUGS.  IT WILL BE VERY RARE THAT  SOMEONE DOES NOT DO IT AGAIN.  IT IS A TOUGH SITUATION. I AM VERY SORRY ABOUT YOUR SON. REMEMBER THAT. IF WE WIN, YOU'RE GOING TO COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND BRING A  GROUP, BECAUSE I CAN LEARN MUCH MORE FROM STEVE THEN I CAN FROM THESE CONSULTANTS THAT GET PAID MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.   YOU KNOW? I CAN LEARN, HONESTLY, SO MUCH MORE FROM STEVE THEN I CAN THESE CONSULTANTS WHO GET THE ONIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BY THE GOVERNMENTS AND ALL OF THE DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT HIGHER  THEM. HE KNOWS MORE ON HIS ONE HAND THEN THEY NOW. -- THAN THEY KNOW. NOW, AS FAR AS IT IS CONCERNED,  MEXICO COULD STOP THIS STUFF. THEY ARE TOUGH AS HELL. THEY COULD STOP IT. THEY CAN STOP PEOPLE FROM COMING ACROSS OUR BORDER. THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR OUR COUNTRY. THEY COULD STOP IT BEFORE THE WALL.  THE WALL IS GOING UP, FOLKS. BUT MEXICO, THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT COULD STOP IT. THEY COULD STOP IT IN TWO MINUTES.  YOU KNOW, A FRIEND OF MINE WAS IN MEXICO ON A VACATION OR SOMETHING AND OVERSTAYED FOR  LIKE TWO DAYS, AND HE GETS A KNOCK ON THE DOOR FROM THE  POLICE. ""WHY ARE YOU HERE? YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE?"" HE WAS A BUSINESS GUY. HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. BUT THAT IS THE RIGHT THING. CAN YOU IMAGINE US DOING THAT? THEY JUST WALK RIGHT THROUGH. OR ANCHOR BABIES. TRY HAVING AN ANCHOR BABY IN MEXICO, OK? JUST TRY IT. THEY WOULD LAUGH AT YOU. THEY WOULD NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. SO GO AHEAD, MA'AM.  PART OF YOUR PROBLEM  IS REGULATIONS.  WE ARE GOING TO BE GETTING RID OF SO MANY OF THOSE REGULATIONS.  WE MAY GO BACK 20 YEARS, BUT THEY HAVE PUT REGULATIONS ON US AND ALL IT DOES IS BUREAUCRACY. IT IS LIKE COMMON CORE. I AM TOTALLY OPPOSED A COMMON CORE. YOU HAVE TO SEE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GUYS LIKE JEB BUSH ARE TOTALLY  IN FAVOR OF COMMON CORE. THEY WANT YOUR KIDS EDUCATED FROM WASHINGTON, AND THEY ARE WEAK ON IMMIGRATION.  REMEMBER, THEY COME AS AN ACT OF LOVE.  THEY COME AS AN ACT OF LOVE.  THAT WAS JEB BUSH.  GIVE ME A BREAK. THEY COME AS AN ACT OF LOVE. YOU CANNOT HAVE THAT, AND  BUSINESSES, THE REGULATIONS ARE SO ONEROUS THAT YOU CANNOT SURVIVE. GO AHEAD.  THE FEES, THAT IS RIGHT.  AND THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE WHOLE THING. LOOK. NOTHING LIKE EDUCATION BEING LOCALLY BASED.  I HAVE SEEN IT. I HAVE WATCHED IT. I AM A BELIEVER IN EDUCATION. I HAVE A GREAT EDUCATION. IT HAS HELPED ME ALL A LOT. I WILL TELL YOU, EDUCATION IS SO IMPORTANT. COMMON CORE IS A DISASTER. IT IS GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON. BUT IT IS A DISASTER. BUT WE GOING TO HAVE EDUCATION. IN THE WORLD, WE ARE NUMBER 30. 30 IN THE WORLD AND EDUCATION. -- 30 IN THE WORLD, IN EDUCATION. WE ARE NUMBER ONE COST PER PUPIL, BUT WE ARE NUMBER 30 IN THE WORLD. IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE, FOLKS. COMMON CORE IS GOING TO BE OUT OF HERE. GO AHEAD.  I AGREE.  GIVE US SOME STUFF.  OK, GIVE IT TO HIM.  HE WILL GIVE IT TO. THANK YOU. VERY INTERESTING. YES, GO AHEAD.  IT IS GOING UP SO FAST.  GO AHEAD.  TO PUT IT MILDLY.  IT IS GOING TO GO UP ANOTHER $2 TRILLION BECAUSE OF THE NEW BUDGET.  IT HAPPENED BECAUSE  WE HAVE INCOMPETENT POLITICIANS. IT HAPPENED BECAUSE WE HAVE CROOKED POLITICIANS.  IT HAPPENED BECAUSE WE HAVE POLITICIANS THAT ARE GETTING MASSIVE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS, AND THEY ARE PROTECTING COMPANIES AND COUNTRIES, AND WITH ME, NONE OF THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. DON'T WORRY, WE ARE GOING TO GET IT DOWN.  IT IS CALLED COMPETITION.  I GUARANTEE YOU. I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE DRUG COMPANIES. IN THE MILITARY, YOU HAVE THE SAME THING. IN EDUCATION, YOU HAVE THE SAME RATE.  YOU HAVE THE SAME THING EVERYWHERE. NO COMPETITION. IT IS GOING TO GO DOWN. TREMENDOUSLY. IT IS GOING TO GO DOWN. OK.  YES.  YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW  MANY PEOPLE ASK THAT QUESTION.  YOU KNOW, IN ONE WHEN YOU DO NOT WHAT TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU WANT SURPRISE.  I ALWAYS SAY, UNPREDICTABLE.  WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID WE WERE LEAVING IRAQ ON A CERTAIN DATE, THEY SAID, WHY WOULD THEY TELL US THAT?  AND THEY PULLED BACK. THEY DON'T WANT TO DIE AS MUCH AS PEOPLE SAY THEY DO NOT CARE. THEY DO CARE, AND RIGHT AFTER  THAT DATE, THEY WENT IN TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO.  IT IS ALL CONTROLLED BY IRAN.  SOON, IT WILL BE TOTALLY  CONTROLLED, INCLUDING ALL OF THE OIL, BUT THERE IS A CERTAIN THING.  REMEMBER THE 50 SOLDIERS THAT WE  WERE SENDING OVER?  ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO. ""WE ARE SENDING 50 SOLDIERS OVER  TO IRAQ AND SYRIA.  WE ARE SENDING 50 SOLDIERS."" BIG NEWS CONFERENCE. WHY ARE WE TELLING PEOPLE THIS? RIGHT? WHY ARE WE TELLING PEOPLE THIS? SO NOW THESE 50 YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL  PEOPLE HAVE TARGETS ON THEIR BACK.  EVERYONE IS LOOKING FOR THEM. IF HE DID NOT SAY THAT, THEY WOULD NOT KNOW, BUT HE WANTS THE PUBLICITY, AND EVEN IT IS NOT A  GOOD THING TO SAY BECAUSE 50 IS SO SMALL.  IT IS ALMOST LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU  DOING WITH 50 PEOPLE? SO WHY DO THEY SAY THIS? SO WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT ISIS, I HAVE PLANS.  I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE OIL. BUT I HATE TO TALK ABOUT IT.  I JUST WANT TO DO IT. I WANT TO DO IT. I WANT TO DO IT.  AND I HAVE SOME VERY DEFINITE IDEAS.  I WANT TO DO BANKING CIRCLES. THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT ARE SOPHISTICATED WHERE MONEY IS POURING IN.  YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE TOMORROW. BUT IF I WIN, I AM NOT GOING TO BE TALKING. I ALWAYS SAY, GENERAL GEORGE  PATTON AND GENERAL MACARTHUR, THESE WERE GREAT SEMI-MODERN DAY GENERALS. THESE WERE TOUGH COOKIES. THEY DID NOT TALK. CAN YOU IMAGINE GENERAL GEORGE PATTON BEING ASKED, SITTING ON A TELEVISION SHOW, TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO? HE WOULD SMACK THE HELL -- HE LIKED SMACKING PEOPLE IN THE FACE.  HE WOULD SMACK THE ANCHOR IN THE FACE FOR ASKING THE QUESTION. NO, BUT THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND  OF A WORLD. AND I DO NOT WANT TO BE TALKING TOO MUCH ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT. ALL I CAN SAY, DARLING, IS TRUST  ME, WE WILL WIN. WE WILL WIN SO FAST.  OK?   AND WE WILL HIT THEM  VERY, VERY HARD.  YES, SIR, GO AHEAD.  I AM ABSOLUTELY OK WITH TERM LIMITS.  TO ME, IT IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU,  BECAUSE IN THEORY, A TERM LIMIT ARE THE VOTERS.  IF SOMEBODY DOES NOT DO THEIR JOB, THEY ARE VOTED OUT. BUT I AM ABSOLUTELY OK WITH TERM LIMITS.  THEY ARE PROTECTIVE OF THEMSELVES.  WELL, THEY DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE OBAMACARE. DID YOU NOTICE? LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT. HOW GOOD IS OBAMA CARE WHEN THEY DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE IT.  WE HAVE TO TAKE IT. THEY DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE IT. THAT TELLS YOU EVERYTHING. IT IS DISGUSTING. I AM OK WITH GETTING RID OF THE TERM.  OK, ONE MORE, AND THEN WE WILL GO OUT.  WHO HAS GOT A GOOD, INTERESTING QUESTION? HE IS A ROUGH LOOKING GUY, THAT GUY. GO AHEAD, DARLING, GO AHEAD. HI.  A YOUNG FLIGHT ATTENDANT.  RIGHT.  BEING ANGRY IS OK. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE YOU HAPPY AGAIN, BUT BEING ANGRY IS OK.  I DO NOT BLAME YOU. FRANKLY.  THE WORLD WAS A DIFFERENT PLACE, AND WE HAVE ALLOWED IT TO BE A DIFFERENT PLACE. IT IS NOT THAT IT SHOULD BE DIFFERENT, BUT WE HAVE LOADED  THROUGH WEAKNESS. THROUGH WEAKNESS. SHE TALKS ABOUT ANGER, AND I LIKED THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT WORD. AND A LOT OF PTSD, WHY THEM? THEY ARE SO YOUNG? WHY NOT ME? --  I UNDERSTAND.  AND THE PREVIOUS DEBATE, THE ONE WAS PREVIOUSLY, I WAS HAPPY WITH IT BECAUSE I RAISED MONEY FOR THE VETS.  I DO NOT KNOW GOOD OR BAD. BUT RECENTLY, I WAS ASKED ABOUT ARE WE ANGRY, BECAUSE WE HAVE A WHOLE MOVEMENT. IT IS A MOVEMENT. RECENTLY, AS YOU KNOW, GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY MADE A SPEECH, AND SHE TALKED ABOUT THE ANGER LIKE IT WAS A BAD THING. BY THE END OF THE DAY, SHE WAS  TALKING ABOUT IT LIKE IT WAS OK BECAUSE SHE WAS BEING HIT BY SO MANY -- BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ANGRY.  WE ARE ANGRY AT THE STUPIDITY OF OUR GOVERNMENT, THE FACT THAT WE ALLOW THINGS LIKE ISIS TO HAPPEN SHOULD NOT HAPPEN.  THE WEAKNESS OF OUR LEADERS, THE  TOTAL WEAKNESS, SO DURING THE  DEBATE, THE PREVIOUS DEBATE,  THEY ASKED ME ABOUT ANGER, AND  I SAID -- AND IT WAS AS PER WHAT SHE WAS SAYING. THEY THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO SAY, NO, I AM NOT ANGRY. I AM REALLY NOT ANGRY, AND I SAID TO MYSELF, YOU HAVE TO THINK PRETTY QUICKLY ON THESE THINGS, AND I SAID I AM ANGRY, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ANGRY. WE ARE NOT ANGRY PEOPLE. I AM NOT AN ANGRY PERSON, BUT WE ARE ANGRY AT THE LEVEL OF INCOMPETENCE THAT WE SEE IN OUR  GOVERNMENT, AND THE LEVEL OF STUPIDITY. AND UNTIL WE CORRECT IT, WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE ANGRY, AND SO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO SHOW UP BY THE THOUSANDS. SO THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH  BEING ANGRY, AND IT IS VERY INTERESTING. THAT AFTERNOON, NIKKI HALEY  WOULD SAY DONALD TRUMP IS MY  FRIEND, AND HE IS A CONTRIBUTOR. A WHOLE DIFFERENT CHANGE. BUT THE TRUTH IS, I AM NOT  KNOCKING HER, BUT CERTAINLY THE  TONE OF IT CHANGED. WE ARE ANGRY, BUT WE ARE NOT  ANGRY PEOPLE, AND WHEN WE SEE SERGEANT BERGDAHL, AND SIX  PEOPLE GOT KILLED LOOKING FOR  HIM, AND THEY GOT FIVE BACK IN THE BATTLEFIELD OR WHO SOON WILL BE, AND WHEN WE GIVE A RAN $150 -- IRAN $150 BILLION, WE GET NOTHING. AND THEN THEY TAKE OUR 10  SAILORS, AND FRANKLY, IF THE MONEY HAD NOT IN PAST, THEY  WOULD STILL HAVE THEM.  YES, WE ARE ANGRY. WE ARE ANGRY. HOPEFULLY, WE WILL NOT BE ANGRY FOR LONG.  WHEN WE SEE THE STUPIDITY AND INCOMPETENCE OF, WE ARE ANGRY. AND THERE IS NOTHING WRONG FOR BEING ANGRY.  WE HOPE YOU GO OUT AND VOTE TOMORROW. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. GOOD. O GREAT. WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE THE  PRESENTATION? GREAT TO SEE YOU.  IT GOOD, I WILL SIGN THAT RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU EVERYBODY. I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.  I WILL SIGN THAT AFTER.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. WE JUST KEPT DRIVING AND DRIVING. THAT IS A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE. THIS IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT OUR COUNTRY. WHO WATCHED THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT? IT WAS GOOD, RIGHT? WE HAD A LOT OF FUN. EVEN PEOPLE THAT HATE ME GAVE ME GOOD MARKS. SOME OF THOSE PUNDITS HATE ME SO MUCH. IT WAS SO HARD. ONE OF THEM SAID HE WON THE DEBATE. I CANNOT STAND IT. THEY WERE ALMOST CRYING. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS INTERESTING AND CAME ACROSS EVEN MORE SO ON TELEVISION WAS THE ROOM WAS LOADED UP. THEY HAD 1000 SEATS, WHICH IS NOT A BIG ROOM. THEY HAD, LET'S SAY, 1000. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE YOUNG PEOPLE FROM THE COLLEGE. WHAT HAPPENED IS ALL THE RICH DONORS AND SPECIAL INTERESTS AND LOBBYISTS GOT ALL THE TICKETS. BOO. I KNOW SO MANY OF THEM. A LOT OF MONEY. TREMENDOUS MONEY IN THAT ROOM. I AM LOOKING AT THOSE PEOPLE, THE ANGRY FACES. HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO US? I COMPLAINED. I SAID, ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE GIVING MONEY TO JEB BUSH. HE IS WASTING IT. WHY DON'T YOU JUST THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW? THEY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO VETS. A GUY LIKE BUSH HAS $128 MILLION. HE IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PACK. SUCH A WASTE. ACTUALLY, IT IS NOT A WASTE. ALL THOSE HANDLERS HE HAS GOT MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. WHAT YOU DO IS I AM LOOKING AT THE ROOM AND ICE SPECIAL INTEREST GUYS, GUYS WHO REPRESENT INSURANCE COMPANIES, THE OIL COMPANIES, THE DRUG COMPANIES. THAT IS WHY WE PAY SO MUCH. YOU KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE DRUGS? FOR MEDICARE AND OTHER THINGS, WE ARE THE LARGEST PURCHASER OF DRUGS IN THE WORLD, PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO MAKE PEOPLE BETTER, FINE. WE ARE THE LARGEST. AND YET, WE BUY FOR PRACTICALLY THE SAME PRICES IF YOU GO TO THE LOCAL DRUGSTORE AND TAKE SOMETHING OFF THE COUNTER, THAT IS WHAT WE PAY. PEOPLE SAY, CAN YOU FIND ANY WASTE IN THE COUNTRY? THIS IS JUST ONE THING OUT OF MANY. IF YOU GO TO THE DRUG STORE AND PICK UP A DRUG, THERE IS NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE IN PRICE. FOR SOME REASON, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE REASON IS, WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES. SO, WE BUY DRUGS, BIGGEST IN THE WORLD, AND WE PAY ABOUT $300 BILLION MORE THAN WE ARE SUPPOSED TO IF WE NEGOTIATED A PRICE. THAT IS $300 BILLION ON DAY ONE. HERE IS THE DIFFERENCE. IN THE ROOM LAST NIGHT WE HAD REPRESENTATIVES FROM DRUG COMPANIES. THEY ARE GIVING MONEY TO NUMEROUS PEOPLE. THE HEAD OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON IS JEB BUSH'S TOP FUNDRAISER. LET ME ASK YOU, DO YOU THINK JEB BUSH IS GOING TO MAKE DRUG PRICES COMPETITIVE? AND HE IS A GOOD GUY WOODY , JOHNSON. BUT WOODY JOHNSON IS THE HEAD OF JEB BUSH'S FUND-RAISING. SO LET'S SAY SAY THAT JEB BUSH WON WHICH IS AN IMPOSSIBILITY. BUT LET'S SAY HE WON, WOODY JOHNSON OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON IS THE HEAD -- HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR JEB, IN ALL FAIRNESS TO JEB, WOODY, WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT COMPETITIVELY. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEY WILL NOT COLLECT IN PROFITS. THAT IS THE WAY OUR COUNTRY IS WORKING, FOLKS. I MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT LAST NIGHT THAT IN THE ROOM -- YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED A LOT OF THE , KIDS, THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT 700 PASSES FOR KIDS. I BLAME THE RNC FOR THIS. I THINK IT IS TERRIBLE WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT. I WANTED TICKETS. THEY SAID, YOU HAVE 20 TICKETS. I BROUGHT ALL OF THE ACTION. I GOT 20 TICKETS. IF THESE OTHER GUYS CAME HERE TODAY, THERE WOULD BE FOUR PEOPLE IN THE FRONT ROW. THE OWNER OF THE BUILDING SAID THIS IS THE BIGGEST CROWD WE HAVE EVER HAD. I THOUGHT IT WAS A PROTESTER. I LOVE PROTESTERS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE. YOU LOOK AT IT AND YOU SEE THE KIND OF MONEY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. I AM A SELF FUNDER. I AM PUTTING UP MY OWN MONEY. THAT IS A NICE THING. I AM WAY UNDER BUDGET. RIGHT NOW, I AM $40 MILLION UNDER BUDGET. ISN'T THAT NICE? THINK OF THAT. I AM $40 MILLION UNDER BUDGET AND I AM NUMBER ONE IN THE POLLS. A GUY LIKE JEB HAS SPENT $110 MILLION, AND HE IS DOWN HERE. CAN YOU IMAGINE THIS? I GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF EDUCATION. IN THE WORLD, WE ARE RANKED NUMBER 30. WE ARE NUMBER ONE BY COST PER PUPIL. WE ARE BY FAR THE MOST EXPENSIVE AND YET WE HAVE THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES THAT DO BETTER THAN US. YOU HAVE SWEDEN AND NORWAY AND DENMARK AND CHINA IN THE TOP FOUR OR FIVE. WE ARE NUMBER 30. AND YET, WE SPEND MORE. WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF YOU COULD TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT I AM DOING HERE, IF WE COULD SPEND LESS AND BE ONE OR TWO OR FIVE? ONE OF THE REASONS WE DO SO BADLY IS COMMON CORE. IT IS A DISASTER. WE GET RID OF THAT AND WE START EDUCATING YOUR CHILDREN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. PEOPLE HATE COMMON CORE BUT NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE BAD PEOPLE OR THEY ARE HATERS. IT IS NO GOOD. WHO WANTS TO HAVE A BUREAUCRAT IN WASHINGTON TAKING CARE AND EDUCATING YOUR KIDS? YOU DO NOT WANT IT. YOU WANT TO HAVE LOCAL EDUCATION. I HAVE SEEN IT AND I'VE WATCHED IT AND IT IS BEAUTIFUL. THEY HAVE THE BOARDS, AND IT IS BEAUTIFUL. THE CHILDREN GRADUATE AND THEY STAY IN THE BOARDS BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE SCHOOL. THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE. IT IS SO IMPORTANT. WE WANT TO BE AT A POINT WHERE WE CAN SPEND LESS MONEY AND HAVE A FAR STRONGER AND BETTER COUNTRY. I LOOK AT MILITARY EXPENDITURES. I WILL BUILD A MILITARY BIGGER, BETTER, STRONGER.   I GUARANTEE WE CAN DO IT FOR LESS MONEY. I HEAR STORIES LIKE THEY ARE ORDERING MISSILES THEY DO NOT WANT BECAUSE OF POLITICS, BECAUSE OF SPECIAL INTERESTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THE MISSILES IS A CONTRIBUTOR AND THE OTHER COMPANY THAT MAKES THE MISSILES THAT ARE NOT GOOD IS NOT. WE ARE ORDERING MISSILES THAT THE GENERALS DO NOT WANT BECAUSE OF POLITICS. SO HERE IS THE BEAUTY. THEY COME TO ME AND THEY SAY WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO USE SUCH AND SUCH A COMPANY BECAUSE WE HAVE HELPED YOUR FRIENDS. I DON'T CARE. I HAVE NO FRIENDS AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED. YOU KNOW WHO MY FRIENDS ARE? YOU ARE MY FRIENDS.   I THINK SELF FUNDING IS BIG. I AM THE ONLY ONE THAT IS SELF FUNDING. DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. EVERYONE ELSE IS TAKING MONEY FROM -- I CALL THEM THE BLOOD SUCKERS. THESE GUYS ARE REALLY GOOD. WHEN THEY GIVE TED, $5 MILLION, WHEN THEY GIVE MARCO -- DID MARCO DO WELL LAST NIGHT IN THE DEBATE? DID TED DO WELL IN THE DEBATE? HOW DID YOU LIKE MY ANSWER WHEN THEY TALKED ABOUT WATERBOARDING? DID PEOPLE LIKE THAT? SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS CONTROVERSIAL. WE HAVE WATERBOARDING, SOME PEOPLE CONSIDER IT LESS THAN TORTURE. THEY GAVE THE ANSWER TO TED, AND HE WANTED TO STAY AWAY FROM IT. I DID NOT. HE WANTED TO STAY AWAY FROM IT. MY ANSWER WAS THIS -- WE ARE LIVING IN MEDIEVAL TIMES. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME LIKE THIS. I USED TO READ IN MEDIEVAL TIMES , THEY CHOPPED YOUR HEAD OFF. EVEN IN THE WILD WEST YOU WOULD GET SHOT. THEY WOULD SHOOT YOU BUT NOT TOP -- CHPOP YOUR HEAD OFF. JAMES FOLEY. I SAID TO MYSELF, WATERBOARDING IS PEANUTS COMPARED TO WHAT THEY ARE DOING. AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED, WATERBOARDING IMMEDIATELY IS OK. IF WE CAN GET MORE THAN THAT, THAT IS OK TOO. AND EVERYONE WAS SHOCKED AND THEY LIKED IT.   IN LIFE AND IN BUSINESS, YOU HAVE TO KNOW -- POLITICALLY CORRECT, NO ONE WANTS TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT SAYS THE MAN WITH THE RED HAT SAYING MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. BUT SO IMPORTANT. I DID NOT KNOW THIS QUESTION WAS COMING UP. BUT I GAVE AN ANSWER THAT -- WE CANNOT BE POLITICALLY CORRECT. WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME OR THE THE STRENGTH -- IT IS OK, YOU WANT TO BE GOOD, BE GOOD PEOPLE. BUT THEY ARE DOING SUCH A HORRIBLE THING. WHEN THEY ARE WILLING TO FLY AIRPLANES INTO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, INTO THE PENTAGON, HEAD AN AIRPLANE INTO THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE WE HAD BRAVE SOULS THAT DITCHED IT BEFORE IT GOT THERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. THOSE PEOPLE WERE GREAT. BUT WHEN THEY HAVE THIS KIND OF HATRED AND EVIL, WATERBOARDING? I GUARANTEE YOU THEY ARE SITTING BACK THERE SAYING, CAN YOU IMAGINE THESE STUPID PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT WATERBOARDING LIKE IT IS A WORSE THING. AND THEY ARE CHOPPING OFF HEADS. THE BEST RESPONSE I GOT LAST NIGHT WAS FROM ALL OF THESE DONORS. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. THEY WERE NOT MY DONORS. THEY WERE DONORS FOR THESE OTHER GUYS. AND YOU COULD SEE POCKETS. THEY WENT OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE RICH AND BOUGHT THE TICKETS FROM THE KIDS THAT WERE GIVEN THE TICKETS. THE KIDS MADE A FORTUNE LAST NIGHT. THE KIDS WERE SCALPING TICKETS LAST NIGHT. THE PEOPLE OUT THERE, I WAS TOLD, WE GAVE THEM TO THE CHILDREN OF THE COLLEGE. UNLESS THE CHILD IS 54 YEARS OLD AND LIVES ON PARK AVENUE. I LOOK AT THAT AUDIENCE AND I SAID, THIS IS TOUGH. I HAVE AN AUDIENCE WHERE I AM THEIR WORST NIGHTMARE. I AM NOT TAKING THEIR MONEY. I DON'T NEED THEIR MONEY. AND THAT IS WHAT WE NEED. PEOPLE FOUND THAT INTERESTING LAST NIGHT. WHEN I HEARD ABOUT IT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHAT DID HE SAY? HE WANTS TO KNOW -- GO AHEAD AND SAY IT. HE WANTS TO KNOW WHO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL? WHO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL? ACTUALLY, WE KID AND WE HAVE FUN. THEY ARE PAYING FOR THE WALL. THEY ARE. WHY WOULDN'T THEY? THEY MAKE A FORTUNE OFF OF THE UNITED STATES. THEY HAVE NOT HELPED US AT ALL WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. WE HAVE TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. NEW HAMPSHIRE, YOU KNOW, I HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. BEFORE THE POLITICAL THING THAT WE STARTED SEVEN MONTHS AGO, I HAVE BEEN UP HERE SEVERAL TIMES. GREAT PEOPLE HERE. YOU HAD BETTER VOTE FOR ME. I DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY. I NEED YOUR VOTE. KEEP YOUR MONEY. I DO NOT WANT YOUR MONEY. MOST GUYS ARE SAYING -- WILL YOU CONTRIBUTE? WE WILL TAKE ANYTHING, GIVE US AN UNDERSHIRT. I DON'T WANT ANYTHING. I WANT ONE THING. ON TUESDAY, YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE BECAUSE WE HAVE A MOVEMENT GOING ON THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE. IT WAS ON THE COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE LAST WEEK. THEY TALK ABOUT THE MOVEMENT. IT IS UNBELIEVABLE WHAT IS HAPPENING. NO MATTER WHERE WE GO, WE GET THESE CROWDS. WE WILL DO GREAT IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND NEVADA AND AT THE SEC. THAT IS THE NEXT EVENT. WE HAD SOMETHING GOING ON. IT IS A SIMPLE MOVEMENT. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AND WE MAY HAVE A CHANCE OF MAKING AMERICA A GREATER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN BEFORE. BRING BACK OUR JOBS. YOU GOT STRIPPED IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. ONE OF THE THINGS I HEAR ABOUT NEW HAMPSHIRE SO MUCH, AND IT IS SHOCKING, BECAUSE YOU DRIVE THROUGH THE BEAUTIFUL WOODED AREAS. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE. ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACES YOU WILL EVER SEE. IT IS TRUE. AND THERE IS A GREAT SPIRIT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS -- AND IT DOES NOT SEEM TO GO AND THAT IS WHY IT IS SO SURPRISING TO ME. THE HEROIN PROBLEM. THE DRUG PROBLEM. AND ALL OF THE STUFF THAT IS POURING IN IS INCREDIBLE. THE DRUGS COMING INTO NEW HAMPSHIRE IS INCREDIBLE. WHEN I AM WITH PEOPLE, WHEN I COME OUT WITH GROUPS, USUALLY PEOPLE WILL TALK ABOUT THE MILITARY, WHICH THEY DO TALK ABOUT THE MILITARY AND THE VETS. WE HAVE AL -- UH OH. THE OWNER WAS SUCH A NICE GUY -- I WOULD LIKE IT IF THE MICROPHONE DID NOT WORK. I COULD SAY, THAT IS ALL WE COULD GO FOR, FOLKS. WE COULD NOT PAY THE RENT. THE COUNTRY WOULD PAY THE RENT IF THE MICROPHONE DOESN'T WORK. IF IT DOES WORK FOR ME I SAY I AM NOT PAYING ANYTHING. BUT WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE FROM THE VETS. THE THING I HEAR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN TERMS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE'S PROBLEMS IS THE DRUG PROBLEMS AND YOU JUST DO NOT ASSOCIATE THAT WITH NEW HAMPSHIRE. IT IS POURING ACROSS LARGELY FROM THE SOUTHERN BORDER. WE WILL TAKE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BADLY ADDICTED AND WE WILL WORK TO GET THEM BETTER. IT IS INTERESTING.   WITH THE DRUG THING AND ALCOHOL AND OTHER ADDICTIONS. IF YOU DON'T START, IT IS REALLY EASY TO SOLVE. IT IS LIKE SMOKING. IF YOU NEVER SMOKE A CIGARETTE, YOU DON'T HAVE TROUBLE QUITTING. IF YOU NEVER START TAKING DRUGS, YOU WON'T HAVE A PROBLEM. WHEN WE MAKE IT SO HARD FOR THEM TO GET INTO THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE THAT WALL. THAT WALL WILL BE SO BIG AND SO STRONG AND SO POWERFUL AND WE WILL HAVE BORDER GUARDS. WE WILL HAVE OUR BORDER GUARDS. A COUPLE OF THESE POLITICIANS I DEALING WITH, THEY SAID TO ME ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO, YOU CANNOT REALLY BUILD A WALL. CAN YOU? I SAID WRONG. I BUILD BUILDINGS THAT ARE 94 STORIES TALL. WALLS, GIVE ME A BREAK. IT WILL BE A NICE WALL. BEAUTIFUL. IT WILL BE A BIG AND BEAUTIFUL WALL. WE WILL NAME IT TRUMP SOMEDAY, MAYBE. IT WILL BE A POWERFUL WALL. RIGHT NOW, THEY HAVE WALLS WITH RAMPS. I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY THEY BUILT RAMPS GOING OVER THE WALLS. WE HAVE LITTLE, BABY WALLS ALREADY. THEY BUILD RAMPS. THEY DRIVE TRUCKS OVER THE RAMPS. OVER THE WALL AND DOWN. LOADED UP WITH DRUGS. THEY DROP OFF THE DRUGS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND THEN THEY GO BACK OVER THE RAMP. I SAID, WHY DON'T THEY JUST KNOCK THE WALL DOWN? MAYBE THEY WANT TO BE NICE TO US. WE END UP GETTING THE DRUGS AND THEY END UP GETTING THE MONEY. IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN THAT WAY ANYMORE, FOLKS. WHEN I SAY I AM GOING TO BUILD A WALL, THESE POLITICIANS COME UP TO ME. THEY ARE WELL-MEANING. BUT THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. THEY KNOW ONE THING, HOW TO GET REELECTED. THAT IS WHAT THEY KNOW. THE WAY THEY GET REELECTED IS ALL OF THE GUYS IN THE AUDIENCE LAST NIGHT TAKE CARE OF THEM IN -- AND THE DRUG COMPANY GUYS MAKE SURE THAT YOU NEVER NEGOTIATE THE PRICE OF DRUGS AND THE OIL GUYS MAKE SURE ALL GOOD THINGS HAPPEN WITH RESPECT TO OIL. ALL OF THESE THINGS IS THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SYSTEM FOR A LONG TIME AND A VERY BIG DONOR. I UNDERSTAND IT. WHEN YOU HAVE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, YOU LOOK AT HEALTH INSURANCE. THE REASON WE HAVE THE ARTIFICIAL LINES -- THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WANT TO HAVE IT THAT WAY. THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE MONOPOLIES IN EACH STATE THAN HAVE HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES GOING ALL OVER THE PLACE BIDDING SO WE COULD GET PRICES WAY DOWN. OBAMACARE IS A DISASTER AND IT IS EXPENSIVE, NO GOOD, AND IT DOES NOT WORK.   THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SAY -- THEY WERE IN THE ROOM LAST NIGHT, I KNOW THESE PEOPLE. THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SAY LISTEN -- I WANT TO TAKE NEW YORK. YOU TAKE SOME OTHER PLACE. YOU TAKE IOWA. YOU TAKE SOME OTHER PLACE. I WANT CALIFORNIA. PERSONALLY, CALIFORNIA IS VERY GOOD, BUT THEY HAVE LINES AROUND THE STATES. NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS THE SAME THING. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE BUSINESSES, IT IS HARD TO GET COMPETITIVE BIDS. THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SAY I WOULD RATHER HAVE NEW HAMPSHIRE THAN HAVE A LOT OF BIDDING. IT IS SO HARD FOR ME TO MAKE DEALS. IT IS SO HARD FOR ME TO MAKE DON'T GET BIDS. ONCE WE GET RID OF THE LINES, IT WILL BE EASY. WHY CAN'T WE GET RID OF THEM? THE INSURANCE COMPANIES GIVE TREMENDOUS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GUYS I AM ON THE STAGE WITH. WHETHER IT IS THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, DRUG COMPANIES, OR OIL COMPANIES -- IT IS ALL THE SAME THING. WE WILL NEVER GET OUR COUNTRY BACK IF WE KEEP DOING THIS. WE ARE NEVER GOING TO GET BACK. I WILL TELL A STORY -- WHERE FORD MOVES, THEY ARE BUILDING A BIG PLANT IN MEXICO. THEY ARE BUILDING A $2.5 BILLION AUTOMOBILE PLANT IN MEXICO. AND I SAY, HOW IS THAT GOOD FOR US? NEW HAMPSHIRE KNOWS BETTER THAN ANYONE BECAUSE YOU HAVE LOST A LOT OF BUSINESS TO MEXICO. I SEE THESE PLACES NOW, AND SOME ARE CONVERTED FOR SENIOR CITIZENS OR APARTMENTS BUT IN THE MEANTIME, YOU NEED JOBS. YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED THE APARTMENTS. YOU TAKE THE JOBS OUT AND ARE GIVING THEM TO OTHER COUNTRIES. WE WILL END THAT. LOOK AT MANUFACTURING RIGHT NOW. LOOK AT CATERPILLAR TRACTOR. IT'S A GREAT COMPANY. BUT LOOK AT WHAT JAPAN IS DOING WITH THEIR CURRENCY, THEY ARE DROPPING THE HELL OUT OF IT. THEY ARE DEVALUING THE CURRENCY TO SUCH A POINT THAT KOMATSU IS KNOCKING CATERPILLAR. WE CAN SAY WE DON'T WANT THEIR CARS. THEY WILL BELIEVE IT, EXCEPT IF I AM THE MESSENGER. YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT MESSENGER. THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT NEGOTIATION. COMMON SENSE. NEGOTIATION. THESE PEOPLE ARE RANK AMATEURS. THEY ARE -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY WHAT THEY ARE. I WILL GET IN TROUBLE. SEE ALL OF THOSE CAMERAS BACK THERE. THEY HAVE NEVER DRIVEN SO FAR TO GET TO A LOCATION IN THEIR LIVES.   IT IS TRUE. WE HAVE TREMENDOUS POWER BECAUSE CHINA IS SUCKING AS DRY AND WITHOUT US, WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA. THEY HAVE TAKEN OUR JOBS. THOUSANDS, MILLIONS OF JOBS. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF JOBS. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF FACTORIES HAVE CLOSED BECAUSE OF CHINA. AND IT DOESN'T DO US ANY GOOD. BY THE WAY, THEY SELL PRODUCTS. YOU TRY PUTTING YOUR PRODUCT INTO CHINA. YOU CAN'T DO IT. IT IS REALLY HARD. BOEING TRIED IT AND THEY MADE BOEING BUILD A BIG AIRPLANE COMPLEX AND THEY KEPT ALL OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. AND NOW BOEING WILL HAVE THIS MASSIVE PLACE IN CHINA AND THEY WILL NOT HAVE TO BUILD AIRPLANES HERE ANYMORE. SO HOW DOES THAT HELP US? IT WILL BE A WHOLE DIFFERENT BALLGAME. WE HAVE A LOT OF POWER OVER THESE COUNTRIES. WHEN JAPAN TAKES THE YEN, THEY HAVE A VERY SMART LEADER AND I GET ALONG WITH HIM GREAT. HE WILL LIKE ME, I'LL LIKE HIM. HE WILL RESPECT US MORE. I HAVE THE BIGGEST BANK IN THE WORLD AS ONE OF MY TENANTS. I SELL MILLIONS OF CONDOMINIUMS TO CHINESE PEOPLE. I LOVE CHINA. I LIKE CHINA. I LIKE JAPAN. WHO? WHAT DOES THAT SAY? OH. THAT IS OK. THAT IS NOT A PROTEST. THAT IS A FRIEND. A VERY ABD VOICE THOUGH, FOR A FRIEND. --A VERY BAD VOICE THOUGH, FOR A FRIEND. ANYWAY. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO --    GET THEM OUT OF HERE PLEASE. GET THEM OUT. AH, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. YOU KNOW THE AMAZING THING -- THEY ARE LOST PEOPLE. GET THEM OUT, SECURITY. PLEASE. YOU KNOW, IT IS AN AMAZING THING. HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT JAPAN RIPPING US OFF AND EVERYBODY RIPPING US OFF AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE AND MILITARY VETERANS. IT IS ALL GOOD. THERE IS NOTHING BAD. I ALWAYS SAY THAT IF I COULD TAKE A PERSON LIKE THAT AND SET THEM IN A ROOM FOR 10 MINUTES I WOULD CONVINCE THEM. UNLESS, THEY HAVE GOT PROBLEMS. I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY IT. SO ANYWAY, WE HAVE THE GREATEST BUSINESS LEADERS IN THE WORLD. WE WILL TAKE THOSE TRADE DEALS AND RIP THEM UP AND REDO THEM. AND THEY WILL BE GREAT.   AND WE HAVE ALL OF THE POWER. OBAMA DOES NOT THINK WE HAVE ANY POWER. WE OWE JAPAN RIGHT NOW $1.6 TRILLION. WE OWE CHINA $1.7 TRILLION. ISN'T THAT AMAZING? THEY COME IN AND TAKE OUR JOBS. THEY TAKE OUR MONEY AND WE OWE THEM MONEY. IT IS LIKE A MAGIC ACT IN REVERSE. NO GOOD FOR US, GOOD FOR THEM. THEY TAKE OUR JOBS AND OUR MONEY AND THEY RUIN OUR BASE AND WE OWED THEM MONEY. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN THAT ANYMORE. THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN ANYWHERE. WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT BUSINESSMAN. THEY ARE NOT SUPPORTING ME BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT THEIR MONEY, BUT THEY ARE ENDORSING ME. I WILL TAKE THESE GUYS. THESE ARE KILLERS. SOME ARE VERY NICE. NOT A LOT OF THEM. WHO CARES? SOME ARE VICIOUS, VIOLENT, HUMAN BEINGS. DO WE CARE? RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NICE PEOPLE. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE POLITICAL HACKS NEGOTIATING WITH CHINA. IDEAL WITH CHINA. THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLE. THEY COME IN, 20 PEOPLE COME IN FOR A DEAL BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE NO ONE MAKES A MISTAKE. THEY ARE TOUGH. THEY DON'T WALK IN -- IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY. THEY COME IN AND SAY -- WE WILL MAKE A DEAL. THERE IS NO GAMES. WE PLAY GAMES. THERE'S NO BUSINESS. I LIKE IT. THEY ARE ABOUT BUSINESS. WE HAVE POLITICAL HACKS. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING. SO HERE IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. WE ARE GOING TO GET THE FINEST BUSINESS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, OUR BEST AND SMARTEST NEGOTIATORS. THEY DON'T WANT ANYTHING. AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE GREAT DEALS. WITH CHINA, WE HAD A TRADE DEFICIT OF $500 BILLION. AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE. BETWEEN $300 BILLION AND $500 BILLION A YEAR. WHAT KIND OF DEAL IS THAT? WITH JAPAN ,IT IS A MASSIVE DEFICIT. SMALLER, BUT A MASSIVE DEFICIT. LOOK AT THE POWER WE HAVE. LOOK AT THE POWER WE HAD TO NEGOTIATE. IF WE TOLD THEM -- LOOK, WE WON'T TAKE YOUR CARS. BUT WE HAVE TO MEAN IT. SOME OF OUR GUYS, I REMEMBER MANY YEARS AGO WE SAID THAT TO JAPAN AND THEY WERE JUST ABOUT READY TO MAKE THE RIGHT DEAL AND OUR GUYS CRACKED. YOU KNOW WHY THEY CRACKED? THE LOBBYISTS AND SPECIAL INTERESTS GOT THEM TO CRACK AND SO WE NEVER TOOK IT TO THE END. I WAS IN LOS ANGELES. I SAW THE BIGGEST SHIPS I HAVE EVER SEEN LOADED UP WITH CARS. THEY COME POURING IN. WHAT DO WE GET? WE SELL THEM BEEF AND THEY DON'T WANT IT AND THEY SEND IT BACK. BY THE TIME THEY TAKE IT THEY CALL IT KOBE BEEF AND SEND IT FOR MORE -- SELL IT FOR MORE. WE SHOULD GET A DISCOUNT BUT THEY CHARGE MUCH MORE. WE KID AND WE HAVE FUN BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU ARE GOT TO HAVE FUN. IF WE CAN'T SMILE AT OURSELVES AND SMILE AT HOW STUPIDLY WE ARE BEING RUN, THEN WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OURSELVES NOT FEEL SO GOOD. WE'RE NOT SMILING. RECENTLY, NIKKI HALEY MADE A SPEECH. SHE TALKED ABOUT ANGER. SHE SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP IS ANGRY. THIS WAS HER RESPONSE TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH AND SHE SAID ESSENTIALLY, DONALD TRUMP IS ANGRY. I KNOW HER. SHE SAID IT NOT NICELY. IN THE PREVIOUS DEBATE WHERE I RAISED THE $6 MILLION FOR THE VETERANS. ACTUALLY, THAT WAS MY BEST PERFORMANCE. THE LAST ONE -- I GOT THE VETERANS $6 MILLION. NOBODY EVEN KNOWS ABOUT IT. THE VETERANS KNOW ABOUT IT. AND AL KNOWS ABOUT IT. WHERE IS HE? WHERE THE HELL IS AL? COME HERE, AL. GET UP HERE. THIS GUY IS SO GREAT. HE DEVOTES HIS LIFE TO THE VETERANS. HE HAS BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE. GET UP HERE. I HAVE NEVER DONE THIS WITH HIM. I NEED TO RECOGNIZE HIM. WE LOVE HIM. DON'T WE LOVE HIM? COME HERE.  >> I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK EARLIER. THOSE WHO WENT TO WAR SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP 150%.   I TELL YOU WHAT, HE GOES TO MY EVENTS AND OTHER PEOPLE'S EVENTS AND HE WANTS TO FIND OUT WHERE IT IS ALL COMING FROM. HE KNOWS WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF THE VETERANS AND IT WILL NOT BE THE POLITICIANS. THEY ARE ALL TALK AND NO ACTION. NOW, WE ARE GOING TO BUILD MILITARY THE SAME WAY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TRADE. WE WILL BUILD UP THE MILITARY. WE HAVE TO NEGOTIATE PRICES AND WE WILL USE THE RIGHT COMPANIES AND GET THE RIGHT STUFF. WE WILL HAVE THE GREATEST STUFF EVER CREATED AND IT WILL NOT BE POLITICAL ANYMORE. THE MONEY THEY ARE SPENDING ON THINGS THEY DON'T WANT IS RIDICULOUS. AND THEN THEY ARE SENDING IT OVER TO ALLIES THAT DO NOT WANT TO FIGHT. I TALK ABOUT 2300 HUMVEES. ARMOR-PLATED, THE BEST IN THE WORLD. I LOVE THE WOUNDED WARRIORS. IF THEY HAD THESE THEY WOULD NOT BE IN THE CONDITION THEY ARE IN. THEY ARE THE MOST AMAZING PEOPLE OF ALL. WOULD YOU SAY,  I SEE THESE PEOPLE AND THEY ARE MISSING THEIR ARMS OR LEGS AND THEY HAVE A BETTER ATTITUDE THAN WE DO. WE SEND OVER THE BEST ARMOR PLATED HUMVEES IN THE WORLD AND WE GIVE THEM TO OUR ALLIES. OUR ALLIES -- WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THEY ARE. WE ARE GIVING THEM TO PEOPLE THAT ARE FIGHTING GOVERNMENT, WE ARE BETTER OFF LETTING THE GOVERNMENT'S GO. SO WE GIVE THEM HUMVEES. THEY HAVE NO SPIRIT TO FIGHT. SHOTS FIRED IN THE AIR. THEY RUN OUT OF THE HUMVEES AND ARE GONE AND THE ENEMIES TAKE OVER 2300 HUMVEES. WHAT THE HELL ARE WE GOING? WHAT ARE WE DOING? IF YOU REMEMBER, I SAID TAKE THE OIL. I WAS THE FIRST ONE. I SAID TAKE THE OIL. FOR FOUR YEARS I HAVE BEEN SAYING TAKE THE OIL, AND NOW THEY ARE TAKING IT. THEY ARE BOMBING IT EXTREMELY GENTLY. THEY ARE AFRAID IT WILL CAUSE AN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD IN THE AIR. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? DO YOU THINK GENERAL GEORGE PATTON EVER SAID WE CANNOT BOMB THE OIL BECAUSE IT MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE CARBON FOOTPRINT? DO YOU THINK GEORGE PATTON -- HE WOULD HAVE SLAPPED THAT ENVIRONMENTALIST. HE WOULD HAVE WALKED UP TO HIM AND SAID GENERAL, YOU CANNOT BOMB BECAUSE RESIDUE WILL GO INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND IT WILL AFFECT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT GEORGE PATTON WOULD'VE DONE? HE WOULD HAVE SLAPPED THE HELL OUT OF THAT GUY. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF THAT ENVIRONMENTALIST. BY THE WAY, I HAVE RECEIVED SO MANY ENVIRONMENTAL REWARDS I WILL NOT KNOCK IT. WE NEED BEAUTIFUL CLEAN WATER AND AIR. THE PRESIDENT TALKS ABOUT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT AND THEN HE GOES TO HAWAII IN A 747, AIR FORCE ONE, THAT IS VERY OLD. IT SPEWS CARBON INTO THE AIR. AND HE GOES TO HAWAII AND STAYS THERE FOR ALMOST THREE WEEKS. AND THEN HE COMES BACK ON THIS MASSIVE PLANE WITH MASSIVE ENGINES AND THEY ARE VERY OLD. THEY ARE NOT ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY, TO PUT IT MILDLY. AND THEN HE GETS BACK AND TALKS ABOUT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT. GIVE ME A BREAK. STAYS THERE FOR THREE WEEKS, PLAYS A LOT A GOLF. HE PLAYS MORE GOLF THAN THE GUYS ON THE PGA TOUR. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD UP OUR MILITARY BUT WITH SUPERVISION SO WE GET BETTER THAN WE ARE GETTING NOW FOR NO MORE MONEY. IN OTHER WORDS, WE CAN BUILD IT -- I DON'T LIKE TO SAY LESS MONEY BUT WE CAN BUILD UP OUR MILITARY AND WE WILL BUILD IT BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER AND WE WON'T SPEND MORE MONEY. JUST LIKE THE DRUG SITUATION WHERE WE CANNOT NEGOTIATE THE PRICE OF DRUGS. YOU PROBABLY HAVE THAT SAME STUFF IN THE MILITARY AND PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. I WILL BE MAKING ENEMIES OF MY OLD FRIENDS. SOME OF THOSE GUYS WERE SITTING THERE AND THEN YOU WONDER WHY THEY BOOED ME. JEB BUSH BROUGHT OUT HIS MOTHER BECAUSE HE NEEDED HELP. MOMMY, PLEASE COME -- WALK IN THE SNOW, MOM. I LIKE HIS MOTHER BUT I DON'T LIKE THAT STUFF. I DON'T LIKE THAT STUFF. WE HAVE GOT TO DO IT ON OUR OWN. WE WILL DO THAT WITH THE MILITARY. AND WE WILL MAKE THIS COUNTRY SO STRONG, AND WE WILL MAKE THOSE BORDERS SO STRONG. AND I AM TELLING YOU. I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE FORD PLANT. SO, HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS. FORD OPENS THIS PLANT. I WOULD NOT LET IT HAPPEN. LET US SAY HILLARY, UGH, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? NOW, I WILL SAY THIS. I DON'T AGREE WITH BERNIE SANDERS ON MUCH, ALTHOUGH I AGREE WITH HIM ON TRADE. HE SAYS WE ARE BEING RIPPED OFF, BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW MUCH. THE DIFFERENCE IS I CAN FIX THE TRADE AND MAKE A LOT OF MONEY , BUT HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. HE JUST SAYS WE ARE BEING RIPPED OFF. HE HAS HALF OF IT. HE IS RIGHT WITH HILLARY BECAUSE -- SHE IS RECEIVING A FORTUNE FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE. THERE IS NO WAY SHE WILL TELL FORD WHAT TO DO. I KNOW PEOPLE THAT DONATE TO HER. SHE CAN'T DO IT. IF SHE WANTED TO DO IT, SHE COULD DO IT. HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS. SO I SAY -- I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN, FORD IS NOT MOVING. WE HAVE A LOT OF POWER IF WE WANT TO USE IT. AND IF HILLARY SAYS IT, SHE IS SMART AND SHE WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN THAT THE NEXT HOUR SHE WILL GET A CALL FROM A DONOR OR A LOBBYIST REPRESENTING FORD. OR ONE OF THE SPECIAL INTERESTS. OR ONE OF THE SHAREHOLDERS. YOU HAVE TO LET IT HAPPEN. 100%, SHE WILL LET IT HAPPEN. HERE IS THE DIFFERENCE. THEY CALLED ME AND THEY SAY -- MR. PRESIDENT, -- YOU ARE CLOSING PLANTS IN MICHIGAN AND ELSEWHERE TO BUILD AND MEXICO. EXPLAIN HOW THAT IS GOOD? AND I WILL SAY -- IT IS OK, YOU CAN BUILD IT BUT WE WILL CHARGE YOU A 35% TAX FOR EVERY CAR , TRUCK, AND PART THAT YOU BRING ACROSS OUR BORDER. WE HAVE TO DO IT. WE HAVE TO DO IT.   AND HERE IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. AS SURE AS YOU ARE STANDING THERE, AND I AM SORRY WE COULD NOT GET YOU ANY SEATS BUT THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE. AS SURE AS YOU ARE STANDING THERE, THEY WILL SAY THE FOLLOWING -- 100%. THIS IS NOT LIKE, MAYBE 82%. THIS IS 100%. THEY WILL SAY, MR. PRESIDENT, WE HAVE TO BUILD A PLANT AND WE WANT TO. THAT IS OK, YOU WILL PAY 35%. THEY WILL CRAWL BACK THE FOLLOWING DAY ASKING IF THEY COULD PERSUADE ME. AND I WILL SAY NO. NO ONE GIVES ME MONEY. I WILL SAY NO. AND THEN, I WILL SAY DO IT OR TROUBLE. AND THEY WILL SAY THE FOLLOWING -- THEY WILL CALL ME BACK WITHIN 48 HOURS AND THEY ARE GOING TO SAY -- MR. PRESIDENT, WE HAVE DECIDED TO BUILD THE PLANT IN THE UNITED STATES. AND I WILL SAY, THANK YOU. THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. BY THE WAY, 100%. 100%. NABISCO IN CHICAGO HAS A MASSIVE PLANT. NO MORE OREOS. THEY ARE MOVING THE PLANT TO MEXICO. IT IS A GOOD THING. WE COULD LOSE A LITTLE WEIGHT. NO MORE OREOS. BUT NABISCO HAS A BIG PLANT IN CHICAGO. THEY ARE MOVING THE PLANT TO MEXICO. TENNESSEE HAD A BIG DEAL FROM A MASSIVE AUTOMOBILE COMPANY WHO WAS GOING TO BUILD A BIG PLANT IN TENNESSEE. IT WAS ALL SET BUT JUST BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT, THEY DECIDED TO MOVE TO MEXICO. SO, YOU TELL ME WHY WE SHOULD ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN AND WHY WE SHOULD ALLOW THESE CARS AND THESE TRUCKS AND THESE PARTS TO POUR INTO OUR COUNTRY AND NO TAX. OK, I AM A FREE TRADER BUT YOU CAN ONLY BE A FREE TRADER WHEN SOMETHING IS FAIR. I WANT FAIRNESS. SAME THING WITH CHINA. CHINA -- IT IS TRUE. CHINA SENDS EVERYTHING IN HERE. WE ARE STUPID. WE HAVE STUPID LEADERS. WE HAVE STUPID PEOPLE RUNNING THINGS. CHINA SENDS BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF PRODUCT INTO OUR COUNTRY. NO TAX. YOU TRY SENDING SOMETHING INTO CHINA. YOU CAN'T DO IT, FOLKS. THEY CALL IT A TARIFF. I HAVE A FRIEND, A VERY RICH GUY -- THERE GOES THE RENT. ONE MORE TIME, NO RENT. ONE MORE TIME, GEORGE IF YOU PAY THE RENT, YOU ARE FIRED.   ONE MORE TIME WITH THIS MICROPHONE AND YOU ARE FIRED, GEORGE. SO, I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS A RICH GUY. THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE ITEM. HE BOUGHT AN AIRPLANE FROM A MAN IN CHINA WHO BOUGHT THE AIRPLANE OVER HERE AND HE CANNOT GET IT BACK TO CHINA BECAUSE THE TAX IS SO MASSIVE, ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE PRICE OF THE AIRPLANE. HE WAS BETTER OFF SELLING THE PLANE, SO HE SOLD THE PLANE TO MY FRIEND AT A HUGE DISCOUNT BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO PAY A TREMENDOUS TARIFF OR TAX TO GET THE PLANE BACK INTO CHINA. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THOSE STORIES. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THOSE STORIES. AND THOSE STORIES ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. ALL OVER THE PLACE. A YEAR AGO, IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING WHAT I HAVE SAID -- THAT I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR SEVEN MONTHS. CAN YOU IMAGINE I HAVE BEEN A POLITICIAN FOR SEVEN MONTHS. JUNE 16, COMING DOWN THE ESCALATOR. IT TAKES GUTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. IT DOES. IT TAKES GUTS. YOU NEED A LOT OF GUTS AND YOU NEED A LOT OF ENERGY. BUT IT IS GOING GREAT AND WE LOVE IT. WE LOVE THE ENDGAME. I DON'T LOVE DOING IT, BUT I LOVE THE ENDGAME, BECAUSE WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT WE CHERISH AND WE LOVE, OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO DO SUCH GREAT THINGS WITH IT. BUT, WE ARE COMING DOWN THE ESCALATOR. IF YOU WERE HERE, I WAS TALKING ABOUT IN THAT GENERAL VICINITY, I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT JAPAN IS DOING. YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING TO CATERPILLAR. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS A BIG EXCAVATOR. BUYS BIG EQUIPMENT. HE ALWAYS BUYS IT FROM CATERPILLAR. HE BOUGHT FROM A BIG EXCAVATOR OR TRACTOR COMPANY IN JAPAN. I ASKED HIM WHAT HAPPENED. HE SAID, I LOVE CATERPILLAR, BUT I CAN'T HELP IT. I BOUGHT FROM THE OTHER COMPANY. WHY? BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO DEVALUED THE YEN I HAD NO CHOICE. HE FELT BADLY ABOUT IT. I ASKED HIM IF THE EQUIPMENT WAS AS GOOD AND HE SAID NO. IT'S NOT BAD, BUT I HAD NO CHOICE. I TOLD PEOPLE THAT IF YOU OWN CATERPILLAR, WITH WHAT THESE FOREIGN COUNTRIES ARE DOING WITH THEIR CURRENCIES, ESPECIALLY CHINA WHICH IS THE KING, KING, KING OF THE WORLD OF CURRENCY MANIPULATION. THE KING OF THE WORLD. THEY WILL NEVER ALLOW OUR COMPANIES TO COMPETE WITH THEIRS, EVER, AND THEY DO IT BASED ON CURRENCY MANIPULATION. THAT IS WHY THE TPP -- THE TRADE AGREEMENT THEY ARE TRYING TO SIGN, IS SO BAD. CHINA IS NOT IN THE AGREEMENT. THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE -- THERE IS NOTHING REALLY TALKING ABOUT CURRENCY MANIPULATION AND THAT IS THE PRINCIPAL TOOL THAT THESE COUNTRIES ARE USING TO KILL US. THEY ARE KILLING US. AND WE ARE GOING TO GET IT STOPPED. AND THAT AGREEMENT IS A HORRIBLE AGREEMENT. BY THE WAY, CHINA IS NOT IN IT NOW, BUT IT IS SO BEAUTIFULLY SET UP, THEY ARE STUDYING IT, THEY'RE GOING TO GO AT SOME POINT INTO THE BACK DOOR, AND THEY WILL BE IN IT AND IT WILL TAKE OVER THAT AGREEMENT, AND THEY WILL MAKE EVEN MORE MONEY THAN THEY ARE MAKING RIGHT NOW. I AM NOT UPSET WITH CHINA, MEXICO, OR JAPAN, THEIR LEADERS ARE JUST TOO SMART FOR THE PEOPLE RUNNING OUR COUNTRY. THE PEOPLE RUNNING OUR COUNTRY DON'T HAVE A CLUE. THEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE. I REFUSE TO SAY THIS, BUT THE WOMAN JUST SAID THEY'RE STUPID, BUT I REFUSE TO SAY THAT. I WILL ADMONISH YOU.   REMEMBER WHEN THAT MAN CALLED OUT AND SAID BAD THINGS ABOUT OBAMA AND I WAS CALLED OUT BY THE PRESS FOR NOT ADMONISHING HIM? I WILL ADMONISH YOU. I WILL NOT THROW YOU OUT. YOU'RE ONE OF OUR FANS, RIGHT? YOU STAND RIGHT THERE.   THEN YOU LOOK AT THE GRANDDADDY -- THE GREATEST FOLLOWS IT. THE IRAN DEAL, WHERE WE GET NOTHING FOR IT. WE DO NOT EVEN GET -- ULTIMATELY WE GOT OUR PRISONERS BACK. WE ESSENTIALLY PAID $150 BILLION, THAT HAS TO BE THE GREATEST RANSOM IN HISTORY, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. $150 MILLION FOR THE POOR GUYS. THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED. WE SHOULD'VE GOTTEN THOSE PRISONERS BACK FOUR YEARS AGO OR THREE YEARS AGO. WE GO IN AND WE SAY, WE HAVE TO HAVE OUR PRISONERS BACK, BEFORE THE NEGOTIATIONS. THEY WILL SAY NO, WE WILL SAY BYE BYE, WE WILL LEAVE THE NEGOTIATIONS, AND THEN YOU RATCHET IT UP. ALL THE THINGS THAT WE DO. THEY WILL GET A CALL WITHIN ONE DAY OR TWO DAYS, IF THEY ARE TOUGH, AND THEY ARE, THEY ARE GREAT NEGOTIATORS. THEY WILL SAY, WE'LL GIVE YOU YOUR PRISONERS. AND THEN YOU GO A STEP FURTHER, ONE OF THE REPORTERS FROM CNN, SHE IS BACK THERE, SHE SAID SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING. SHE'S A GREAT REPORTER, GREAT TALENT. BUT SHE SAID SOMETHING, YOU SAID YOUR FATHER SAID SON, TAKE IT DOWN BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOUR TO -- YOU ARE TO DIRECT. IN THE OLD DAYS I WOULD HAVE SAID WE ARE NOT GIVING YOU THE $150 BILLION, AND THEY WILL GET ANGRY, WE WILL GET ANGRY, EVERYBODY IS ANGRY. SOMETIMES IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO RECOVER FROM THAT. THAT IS THE OLD DAYS. YOU GET WISE, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A SMART FATHER THAT TEACHES YOU. SO NOW I SEE IT DIFFERENTLY. I SAY, GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE A PROBLEM. WE OWN $19 TRILLION. THE REPUBLICANS JUST APPROVED A BUDGET THAT IS GOING TO ADD ANOTHER $2 TRILLION. IT TOOK THEM, LIKE, LESS THAN A DAY TO GET THIS THING DONE. IT IS AN EMBARRASSMENT THAT THEY APPROVED IT. THE ONLY ONE THAT BENEFITS ARE THE DEMOCRATS. THEY GOT EVERYTHING THEY WANTED, FUNDING THE SYRIAN REFUGEES COMING IN, FUNDING OTHER REFUGEES COMING IN, FUNDING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. THEY GOT EVERYTHING THEY WANTED. SO NOW I SAY IT DIFFERENTLY. WE DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY, SORRY. WE WANT TO GIVE IT TO YOU, BUT WE DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING. OK? THAT IS NICER THAN SAYING WE ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU. THEY WILL GET ANGRY, BUT NOT NEARLY AS ANGRY, BECAUSE BY THE TIME I FINISH WITH THEM THEY WILL FEEL SORRY FOR US. AND THEY WILL LEAVE, AND COME BACK IN A WEEK AND SAY WE WILL MAKE A DEAL. WE NEVER WALKED FROM THAT DEAL. THINK ABOUT IT, ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE IS WALK. HOW DO YOU NEGOTIATE A DEAL WHERE THEY ARE DANCING IN THE STREETS ALL OVER IRAN, CALLING US STUPID, BURNING THE FLAG? THIS IS BEFORE THE DEAL GOT DONE. THEY ARE CELEBRATING THE DEAL, SAYING HOW STUPID WE ARE, SAYING IT IS ONE OF THE GREATEST DEAL EVER MADE, THEY ARE DANCING IN THE STREET, THE POPULATION IS EVEN SAYING WHAT A GREAT DEAL THIS IS. RIGHT? AND WE KEEP GOING IN FOR MORE MEETINGS. IF THEY STARTED DANCING IN THE STREETS BEFORE I MADE A DEAL, I WOULD SAY I WOULD GET OUT OF THERE, BECAUSE IT IS EMBARRASSING. WE NEVER ONCE WALKED FROM THE DEAL. I KEPT WAITING FOR OBAMA TO WALK FROM THE DEAL, MEANING HIS PERSON, SECRETARY KERRY. WHAT ABOUT IF I REPRESENTED THE UNITED STATES INSTEAD OF SECRETARY KERRY? DO YOU KNOW HOW GOOD THAT DEAL WOULD BE?   OR IF WE GOT ONE OF OUR GREAT BUSINESS PEOPLE TO NEGOTIATE A DEAL. HERE WE HAVE THIS DEAL THAT IS A HORROR SHOW. WITH THE CLOCK DOES NOT START. ALL OTHER PROBLEMS, LIKE SELF INSPECTION. I JOKE -- YOU KNOW, OBAMA CALLS HIM THE SUPREME LEADER. I AM NOT CALLING HIM THE SUPREME LEADER. HE IS NOT MY SUPREME LEADER. THE SUPREME LEADER SAID THE FOLLOWING -- THERE'S SOMETHING VERY STRANGE GOING ON HERE. BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU CALL AND SAY THIS IS A SELF INSPECTION AREA, A VERY SECRET AREA, PROBABLY WHERE THEY ARE MAKING THEIR DEAL. SOMEBODY COMING UP SAYING WE HEAR YOU ARE MAKING NUCLEAR ITEMS, AND WE NEED YOU TO SELF INSPECT. AND THEY COME BACK AND SAY WE ARE NOT MAKING IT. WHERE DO THESE PEOPLE COME FROM? THE GREATEST DEAL I HAVE EVER SEEN, YOU GET $150 BILLION, BUT THEN WE GET NOTHING. THAT IS PEANUTS. WHAT ELSE ARE THEY GETTING? THEY ARE GETTING IRAQ. THEY WANTED IRAQ FOREVER. FOREVER. BUT WE HAVE IRAQ, AND THEY HAVE IRAN, AND THEY ARE ALWAYS THE SAME MILITARILY. THEY FIGHT, AND FIGHT, AND THEY MOVE 10 FEET HERE, 10 FEET HERE, THEY STOP FIGHTING FOR COUPLE OF YEARS, AND THEN THEY GO BACK AND FIGHT. THE LINE NEVER MOVES. THEY FIGHT. NEUTRALIZED. AND I SAID IN 2003, 2004, DON'T DO IT. I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, WHICH IT TURNED OUT THEY DID NOT HAVE. BUT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR LEADERSHIP OR ANYTHING, IN IRAQ, THEY USED TO KILL TERRORISTS. SADDAM HUSSEIN KILLED TERRORIST. TODAY IT IS HARVARD FOR TERRORISTS. SADDAM HUSSEIN USED TO GET GREAT PLEASURE OUT OF KILLING TERRORISTS. WE DO NOT HAVE THESE PROBLEMS LIKE THAT. NOW WE HAVE A MESS. THIS ONLY CAME UP IN MY MIND A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW BAD A DEAL THIS IS, IT IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF BAD DEALMAKING. THE BEST DEAL THEY ARE ACTUALLY GETTING IRAQ. IRAQ HAS THE SECOND LARGEST OIL RESERVE IN THE WORLD. SO IRAN IS NOW GETTING IRAN AND THEY ARE TAKING IT OVER. NOW THEY'RE GETTING MANAGEMENT DIVISION ON WHAT YOU HAVE IT. BUT THEY DO LIKE THE BORDER BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA. I AM GOOD AT THIS STUFF. I TALKED ABOUT BIN LADEN IN MY BOOK THAT WAS WRITTEN IN 2000 BEFORE THE WORLD TRADE CENTER'S CELL. -- CENTER FELL. AND MORNING JOE GOT THIS BOOK INSIDE THAT HE TALKED ABOUT BIN LADEN BEFORE THE WORLD TRADE CENTERS. HE COULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT, HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT. CLINTON HAD A CHANCE TO TAKE HIM OUT, AND HE DIDN'T DO IT. HE HAD A CHANCE TO GET HIM, AND HE DID NOT DO IT. BUSH SHOULD HAVE DONE IT, BUT HE DID NOT DO IT, AND THEY DID NOT DO IT, AND THE WORLD TRADE CENTER CAME TUMBLING DOWN. THOUSANDS OF LIVES, THE WORST ATTACK IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. WORSE THAN PEARL HARBOR, BECAUSE IT WAS A CIVILIAN ATTACK NOT A MILITARY ATTACK. SO WE HAVE TO GO AND WE HAVE TO GET SMART. YOU HAVE IRAN, NOW THEY ARE RICH FRIDAY THEY DO NOT HAVE TO BUILD A NUCLEAR, THEY CAN AFFORD TO BUY IT. DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE SPENDING THEIR MONEY? THEY JUST BOUGHT AIRBUS JETS. THEY DO NOT BUY FROM BOMBING, THEY BOUGHT FROM AIRBUS -- BOEING, THEY BOUGHT FROM AIRBUS. THEY ARE BUYING MISSILES FROM RUSSIA, THEY DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM US. $150 BILLION, THEY ARE GIVING US NOTHING. WE GET NOTHING. AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT, THE DEAL IS MADE, THEY ATTACK OUR 10 WONDERFUL SAILORS, WITH GUNS TO THEIR HEAD, AND HAVE A GUY SCREAMING AT THEM HUMILIATION. THEY WOULD STILL BE THERE, EXCEPT THEY ARE SMART. THEY DID NOT GIVE THEIR 150 BILLION UNTIL TWO DAYS AFTER THAT. THEY DID NOT WANT TO SAY WE WILL NOT GET THIS, SO THEY LET THEM GO. VICIOUS HUMILIATION FOR US. THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. JUST REMEMBER THAT.   SO WE ARE GOING TO BE TOUGH, WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH CHINA NICELY, BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF POWER COMMITMENT A LOT OF MONEY THAT GOES TO THEM, AND WE DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE THEY SUCK IT OUT. WE WILL REBUILD CHINA. LAST NIGHT FROM A MISSILE WENT OFF IN NORTH KOREA. NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT IS, AND THEY ARE SAYING IT IS A SATELLITE. THERE'S A LOT OF THREATS BEING MADE BY THIS GUY. WITH 28,000 SOLDIERS ON THE LINE. A LOT OF THREATS. THOUSANDS OF TELEVISIONS A YEAR, I BUY THEM FROM SOUTH KOREA. WE DO NOT MAKE TELEVISIONS ANYMORE. WE USED TO MAKE THEM, BUT WE  DO NOT ANYMORE. THEY ARE AN ECONOMIC BEHEMOTH. THEY PAY IS PEANUTS. THEY SHOULD PAY. THEY SHOULD PAY, AT LEAST BREAKEVEN, SOMETHING. WE PROTECTED GERMANY. WE PROTECTED JAPAN, WE PROTECT PLACES YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT. I HAVE BECOME GOOD AT THIS STUFF, BECAUSE I LOOKING AT IT, AND WHEN THEY SAY WE HAVE 10 TIMES THE MILITARY BUDGET OF ANYONE ELSE, YOU KNOW WHY WE DO, AS WE PROTECT ALL THESE COUNTRIES FOR NOTHING. WE PROTECT SAUDI ARABIA. THINK OF IT. NO. NO, WE PROTECT SAUDI ARABIA, BEFORE THE OIL CAME DOWN, NOW THEY'RE MAKING HALF. THEY WERE MAKING $1 BILLION A DAY, AND WE PROTECT THEM AND WE GET PEANUTS. AND WE LEASE LAND FOR MILITARY BASES, WE PAY THEM RENT. IT IS OVER. IT IS OVER. IT IS OVER.   AND HONESTLY, I DO NOT HAVE TELEPROMPTERS, I DO NOT HAVE A SPEECH THAT I AM READING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IT IS SO NICE TO BE WITH YOU, NO CAPS ON -- NEW HAMPSHIRE, PLEASE VOTE FOR ME. ALL I WANT IS YOUR VOTE. I WILL STRENGTHEN THE OUTCOME IT IS SO EASY. IT IS SO MUCH FAT. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT -- THE NUMBERS ARE BIGGER, BUT IT IS EASIER. HERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS, POTENTIALLY. BUT WE HAVE TO STRAIGHTEN IT OUT. AS AN EXAMPLE, WOULD HAVE OUR AGREEMENT, OUR TREATY WITH JAPAN. JAPAN IS ATTACKED, WE HAVE TO ATTACK AND GO TO WAR AND FIGHT WHOEVER ATTACKS JAPAN. OK. IF WE ARE ATTACKED, THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. THESE ARE THE DEALS WE HAVE. IF WE ARE ATTACKED, JAPAN DOES NOT HAVE TO HELP US. THEY ARE ATTACKED, IT IS WORLD WAR III. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN LIKE THIS, IT CAN BE FAIR AND EQUITABLE.   I JUST TELL YOU, BECAUSE IT IS NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE THAT TREMENDOUS PROBLEM WITH DRUGS, WE'RE GOING TO STOP IT. YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE DRUGS COMING IN AND DESTROYING YOUR CHILDREN. YOUR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO LOOK ALL OF THE PLACE, AND THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FIND THEM.   WHEN MOMMY AND DADDY GO TO FLORIDA AND THEY WANT TO GET DRUGS FROM A THEY WILL NOT BE ON THE STREETS. IT IS SO CHEAP. PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT IS SO CHEAP. THAT IS PART OF THE ALLURE. BUT NOT ANYMORE. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO FIND THEM, BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO STOP IT. WE HAVE GREAT BORDER PATROL. THE GREAT BORDER PATROL CALLED ME, AND I WENT TO LAREDO, TEXAS. I SAID THESE ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO DO THE JOB, AND THEY ARE BEING TOLD STAND BACK, LET THE PEOPLE GO THROUGH. LEAVE THEM ALONE. DON'T TOUCH ANYBODY. YOU SAW THE RECENT DECLARATION, IF YOU CATCH ANYBODY, LET THEM GO. WHAT IS GOING ON? WE HAVE A MASSIVE PROBLEM. WE HAVE 179,000 CRIMINAL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. THESE ARE PEOPLE CONVICTED OF CRIMES. SOME OF THEM ARE ROUGH STUDENTS. -- ROUGH DUDES. THAT IS BIGGER THAN ANY CITY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. DID YOU KNOW THAT? IT IS BIGGER THAN ANY CITY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE HAVE 179,000 ILLEGAL CRIMINALS. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, I'M TALKING ABOUT ILLEGAL CRIMINALS. WE CANNOT HAVE IT. IT IS OVER. WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE STRONGEST BORDERS. BY THE WAY, PEOPLE ARE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY, BUT THEY ARE GOING TO COME IN LEGALLY THROUGH PROCESS.   THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN LEGALLY. SO, I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING. IT IS A GREAT HONOR TO HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE. I WILL TAKE MY HOUR AND A HALF DRIVE BACK THE OTHER WAY. I THINK I WILL MISS THE SUPER BOWL, BUT I COULD NOT CARE LESS. YOU ARE AMAZING PEOPLE.   AMAZING PEOPLE. AND ON TUESDAY, GO OUT AND VOTE, AND HOPEFULLY VOTE FOR TRUMP. IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR TRUMP, DO NOT GO OUT AND VOTE. AND A LOT OF POLITICIANS SAY IT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO VOTE, NO MATTER WHO YOU VOTE FOR, BUT I SAY IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR ME, DO NOT VOTE. THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.  ","Donald Trump Campaign Rally in Holderness, New Hampshire"

WE ARE NOT RESPECTED LIKE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A GREAT AGAIN. I'VE ADDED A COUPLE. WE'LL MAKE IT GREATER AGAIN, MAYBE GREATER THAN BEFORE.  WE WILL BRING BACK JOBS FROM CHINA, NEPAL, PLACES THAT HAVE TAKEN OUR JOBS. WE ARE BEING STRIPPED OF OUR JOBS AND MONEY. WE WILL BUILD STRENGTH IN THE BORDERS, WE WILL BUILD A WALL, NOT HAVE PEOPLE POURING IN HERE. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THE MILITARY AND THE VETS. WILL MAKE THE COUNTRY BETTER THAN IT HAS BEEN BEFORE.  IN MANY WAYS. THERE IS A GREAT DEFICIT FROM MEXICO. SO MEXICO DOES NOT HAVE THIS RIGHT. THEY DO NOTHING TO STOP THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. BECAUSE OF THAT, THEY WILL FACE THE WALL.  YOU HAVE GOT TO DO COMPROMISE. THE NEW BUDGET IS A DISASTER. IT DOES EVERYTHING OBAMA WANTS AND GIVES THE REPUBLICANS VERY LITTLE. WE NEED TO PUT THE REPUBLICAN BUDGET IN ORDER. I LIKE PAUL RYAN, BUT THAT IS NOT A GOOD DEAL.  EVENTUALLY, YOU HAVE GOT TO GET ALONG. I WANT TO MAKE GREAT DEALS, NOT BAD DEALS. THIS IS WHAT I DO.  BUT I HAVE BEEN IN POLITICS ALL MY LIFE, ON THE OTHER SIDE. I WILL BE ABLE TO GET PEOPLE INTO A ROOM AND BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET A DEAL. IT IS GOING TO BE A GREAT DEAL FOR US. NOT THESE DEALS THAT THERE MIGHT BE NOW.  WE OF THE GREATEST BUSINESS MAKING PEOPLE IN THE WORLD IN THIS COUNTRY, AND WE DO NOT USE THEM. ON CHINA, THEY ARE MAKING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WITH CHINA, JAPAN, EVERYONE ELSE. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.  WE ARE GOING TO BREAK EVEN. WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE AND RENEGOTIATE. RIGHT THERE, YOU TALKING ABOUT TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF DOLLARS, AND I HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE BACK HERE, I HAVE TO GO.  I THINK HE WOULD BE VERY PROUD. MY FATHER WAS A GREAT GUY AND HE HAD A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN ME. HE WILL BE VERY PROUD.  IT HAS BEEN AMAZING. IT HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE. I AM A BUILDER, AND I HAVE JOBS TO DO.  YES, ABSOLUTE THELY. UNLIMITED.  BY GETTING THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY, AND THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, TO HELP ME RUN THE COUNTRY. WE WILL HAVE OUR BUSINESSMEN NEGOTIATING TRADE.

I THINK VERY WELL.  I LOVE DEFENDING THE POLICE. I LOVE DEFENDING THE VETS, TELLING IT LIKE IT IS IN THE VETS. A LOT OF GOOD MOMENTS. I THINK IT WAS A REALLY GOOD DEBATE.   I WAS SO HAPPY THAT QUESTION CAME OUT. YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ROADS, SALES, FOOLISH PEOPLE KEEP TALKING ABOUT EMINENT DOMAIN. YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT. YOU TALK ABOUT EMINENT DOMAIN, BUT THEY MUST IN THE -- MENTIONED THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE. YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ONE FOOT OF THESE DON'T IF NOT FOR EMINENT DOMAIN. PEOPLE NEED TO GO AND FIND AT WHAT THAT MEANS AND HOW TO USE IT. IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER I RUN OR NOT. WE NEED IT FOR A COUNTRY.  HE WANTED TO SHOW HE WAS A TOUGH GUY. BUT HE IS NOT A TOUGH GUY.  I KNOW WHO -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY. YOU WILL SEE.  I JUST WANT TO SAY. I WILL WAIT FOR A COUPLE OF THEM TO COOL OUT. IT REALLY IS.  I THINK TONIGHT WAS VERY IMPORTANT. YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE CLUBHOUSE, YOU HAVE A LEAD, AND DOING WELL IN THE DEBATE. JUST SORT OF WELL. I HAPPY ABOUT THAT, IF THAT IS THE CASE.  I RAISED TO $6 MILLION FOR THE VETERANS. IF ANYONE SAID YOU HAD TO DO IT AGAIN, I SAID I WOULD DO THE SAME THING. IN ONE HOUR, I RAISED $6 MILLION FOR VETERANS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. I WOULD TAKE IT EXACTLY THE WAY IT TURNED OUT, RAISING $6 MILLION FOR VETERANS.  EVERYBODY IS SAYING I WON THE DEBATE. MANY OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE SAYING I WON EASILY. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE, BUT THEY ARE ALL SAYING IT. HOPEFULLY   IT VERY DIFFERENT. PEOPLE WANT PROTECTION, BORDER SECURITY, A STOP TO DRUGS AND HEROIN. I KNOW ABOUT IT, THERE IS NOBODY MORE COGNIZANT THAN ME. TWO PEOPLE MENTION THE WALL. WHERE WAS THE WALL? IF I'M PRESIDENT, THAT WALL WILL GO SO FAST IT WILL BE SUCH A POWERFUL WALL. >> PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT SENATOR TED CRUZ. YOU STILL SEE HIM AS HER BIGGEST THREAT? DONALD TRUMP:   >> YOU CONSIDER HIM A THREAT  HE IS VERY SPECIAL RATE HE SAID WHEN HE MIGHT HAVE SAID.  IT WAS REALLY A GOOD DEBATE. I WAS REALLY HAPPY WITH MY PERFORMANCE. IN THE WORLD OF THE SPHERE, THEY ARE ALL SAYING I WON, SO I AM HAPPY. I DID WELL. IT WAS A LOT OF FUN.  I HAVE A LEAD. I DON'T KNOW -- I REALLY DID WELL.  YOU GET BURNED BY THE FACT THAT BEN CARSON LOST A LOT OF VOTES. YOU GO OVER TO ANOTHER PERSON THAT ONE IOWA. -- WON IOWA.  IT IS DIFFERENT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE BECAUSE YOU DO NOT HAVE THE CAUCUS SYSTEM. BUT I THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO WELL. I'VE HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH NEW HAMPSHIRE. I THINK IT WILL GO WELL. IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TONIGHT TO DO WELL IN THE DEBATE.  I SPENT A LOT OF MONEY IN GROUND PAY. IT IS MORE IMPORTANT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, PEOPLE NEED TO LIKE YOU AND GO OUT AND VOTE. NOT SO MUCH OF THE GROUND TEAM. I THINK THE DEBATE WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE GROUND TEAM.  TED CRUZ, WILL YOU SAY THAT NOW, I APPRECIATED HE DID NOT DO THAT. AND JEB TRY TO GO, BUT JEFF IS EASY.  SAME RESPONSE OVER AND OVER. DONALD TRUMP: HE WAS SCRIPTED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. HE SAID NEW HAMPSHIRE THE FOURTH TIME --  ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA. I THINK PEOPLE REALLY ENJOYED THE DEBATE, IT IS GETTING HIGH REVIEWS. IT IS AN HONOR TO ME TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED.  I DON'T KNOW, WHO KNOWS? MAYBE -- THEY ARE ALL VERY SMART PEOPLE. I LOOK AT ALL OF THEM AS MY COMPETITOR.  I AM SO HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. WHAT ARE WONDERFUL THING FOR A COUNTRY, HE WOULD NOT HAVE SCHOOLS, ROADS, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ANYTHING. THEY PAY YOU A FORTUNE. DONALD TRUMP LIKES EMINENT DOMAIN. I DON'T LIKE IT. THEY ALSO SAY I TAKE IT. IT IS CALLED TAKING. PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE -- YOU DON'T JUST TAKE IT, THEY PAY. IF YOU ARE SMART YOU WILL GET MUCH MORE FOR THE VALUE.  HE SAID NO EXCEPTIONS. I DO BELIEVE IN EXCEPTIONS ARE YOU I THOUGHT IT WAS A TOUGH QUESTION FOR HIM. I AM NOT SURE WHAT HIS ANSWER WAS BECAUSE HE ACTUALLY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE EXCEPTIONS WHEN HE CAME BACK. SORT OF AN INDICATOR. I HAVE THE RONALD REAGAN -- RONALD REAGAN BELIEVED IN PRO-LIFE.  I CAME IN SECOND, 17 PEOPLE STARTED. IT IS THE FIRST ELECTION I WAS EVER INVOLVED IN, AND I BECAME SECOND. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE AWAY THE BEN CARSON. I AM NOT BLAMING CNN.  YOU ALSO CAME OUT WITH A TWEET A MINUTE LATER. YOU TAKE A WAY THOSE THOUSANDS OF ONE OF THE BIG SHOWS OF THE STUDY, BILL O'REILLY, HE SAYS THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN, TRUMP WOULD PROBABLY HAVE ONE. IT IS FOR BOTH HER PERSON. -- FOUR VOTES PER PERSON. I HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD TIME.  YOU ARE ASKING ME THE QUESTIONS. I DON'T CARE ABOUT IT. WE WANT TO WIN NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE ARE GOING TO DO VERY WELL.  I ACTUALLY SAID, LET'S BLAME CNN AGAIN.   THAT IS YOUR DECISION NOT MINE. YOU HAVE TO ASK HIM.   THE TICKETS WERE ALL, WE PICKED UP THE TICKETS THERE WEREN'T ANY. THE DONORS WERE SUPPORTING, AND IN PARTICULAR THERE WERE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE EVEN IF THEY GAVE A BAD ANSWER, THEY GOT IT WRONG. >> ","Republican Debate Spin Room in Manchester, New Hampshire"

AMAZING.   WE LOVE YOU. AMAZING, IT IS AMAZING. ONE OF THE REPORTERS JUST ASKED ME, WHY DON'T YOU DO TOWN HALL MEETINGS? I SAID WE HAVE 5000 PEOPLE,  THERE IS ANOTHER ROOM THE SIZE PACKED ALSO. IF WE DO TOWN HALLS, WE WILL BE DOING ABOUT 200 DAY AND STILL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CATCH UP. I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY. SPECIAL PEOPLE, SPECIAL PLACE. WE HAVE HAD SUCH AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY SINCE JUNE 16, THE FAMOUS ESCALATOR RIDE.  WE JUST GOT BACK FROM IOWA. I WANT TO TELL YOU, THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE IN IOWA. AND I LOVE THEM. YOU KNOW WHAT?  I WILL TELL YOU. I STARTED OFF, AND IT WAS VERY INTERESTING.  A VERY INTERESTING LITTLE THING. IT IS A CAUCUS SYSTEM, A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT SYSTEM. I DON'T SAY BETTER OR WORSE, BUT  CERTAINLY MORE DIFFICULT. WHEN I ANNOUNCED ON JUNE 16, THERE WERE 17 PEOPLE. I HAD NOT REGISTERED. I HAVE NOT BEEN PUT IN POLLS. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. IN IOWA, THEY SAID DON'T GO TO IOWA. YOU DON'T PLAY IN IOWA. ME.  I SAID WHY? THEY SAID IT IS NOT GOING TO  WORK. I SAID I HAVE TO DO IT AND I WANT TO GO THERE. I WENT THERE, AND I THINK WE DID  REALLY WELL. WE DID REALLY WELL.   THEY SAID IF YOU GET IN THE TOP 10, YOU WOULD BE LUCKY. THE FIRST TIME IT CAME OUT, IT WAS NUMBER 10. AND THEN IT WENT TO EIGHT AND FIVE. WE FINISHED NUMBER TWO. AND FRANKLY, HAD I KNOW WE COULD FINISH NUMBER TWO, MAYBE I WOULD HAVE SPENT MORE TIME THERE. I WOULD HAVE TAKEN A DAY OR TWO OFF FROM HERE, BUT THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN GOOD. IT IS SORT OF INTERESTING.  I'M VERY PROUD OF THIS. I SKIPPED THE DEBATE BECAUSE I WAS NOT TREATED PROPERLY.  I WASN'T.   I WASN'T TREATED PROPERLY. WHEN OUR COUNTRY IS NOT TREATED PROPERLY, WE HAVE TO THE HATE THAT WE ALSO. JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND. WHEN YOU ARE NOT TREATED THE WAY  YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TREATED, YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT. THAT IS ALL RIGHT. THESE ARE THE STATS I WANTED TO SHOW YOU. A LOT OF AIR BLOWING DOWN THERE, I WILL TELL YOU.  WHAT HAPPENED IS I DID THE DEBATE,,= AND THEN I SAID YOU CANNOT DO THAT. . WE COULD HAVE BROKEN THE WORLD RECORD. WE DID IT THE FIRST ONE. THEY HAD 24 MILLION PEOPLE. I THINK IT WAS MORE THAN THAT AFTER FINAL COUNT. I THINK THIS THING WOULD HAVE HAD PROBABLY 26, 28, 29 MILLION PEOPLE.  BUT YOU COULD NOT TELL -- DO IT.  I WILL TELL YOU WHY I'M HAPPY WE DID NOT DO THAT. IN ONE HOUR, WE RAISED $6 MILLION FOR THE VETS. 6 MILLION. WE RAISED $6 MILLION FOR THE VETS.   IF YOU TOLD ME I COULD HAVE FINISHED FIRST IF I DID THE DEBATE WERE SECOND PLUS $69 FOR THE VETS, I WILL TAKE THE $6 MILLION FOR THE VETS ALL DAY LONG.   I AM LOOKING AT  STATISTICS. WE GOT THE BIGGEST VOTE EVER IN THE HISTORY OF A PRIMARY IN IOWA BY LIKE 60,000 PEOPLE CAME OUT EXTRA. I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT WAS ME, BUT WE -- BELIEVE ME IT WAS ME. TWO OR THREE NIGHT AGO, ONE OF THE CANDIDATES I AM AGAINST, HIGHLY RESPECTED, WAS HERE. AND THEY HAD 250 PEOPLE. WE HAVE 5000. THAT SHOULD BE A GOOD SIGN. THAT IS LIKE AN AUTOMATIC POLL.   THE VOTE I GOT BECAUSE WE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE WAS THE BIGGEST VOTE IN THE HISTORY OF IOWA FOR A REPUBLICAN CAUCUS. I MEAN THE BIGGEST IN THE HISTORY OF IOWA.   FOR A REPUBLICAN CAUCUS. WHEN YOU THINK, THE AMAZING THING IS THE PRESS, NOT ALL OF THEM. SOME ARE GREAT.  SOME SAID HE STARTED OFF 10TH AND CAME IN SECOND. I DON'T LIKE TO HEAR SECOND THAT MUCH EITHER, TO BE TOTALLY HONEST. ONE POLL CAME OUT SAID I WAS LEAVING FOR FIVE POINTS. THE HEADLINES WERE ""TRUMP COMES  IN SECOND, HE IS HUMILIATED."" THERE WERE 17 PEOPLE WHEN WE  STARTED. NOW YOU HAVE 11. I COME IN SECOND. I AM NOT HUMILIATED. THINK OF IT.   THESE PEOPLE ARE THE MOST DISHONEST PEOPLE EVER, OK. MARCO IS A NICE GUY, MARCO  RUBIO, NICE GUY, AND HE COMES IN THIRD. HE COMES IN THIRD. HE IS A SENATOR, DOES THIS DO FOR A LIVING, PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN.  HE COMES IN THIRD. I COME IN SECOND. TRUMP NO GOOD. RUBIO, UNBELIEVABLE NIGHT,  UNBELIEVABLE VICTORY.   YOU HAVE TO THINK OF THIS. AND THEN THEY SAID, ""HE IS VERY CLOSE."" I THINK IT IS ABOUT A DIFFERENCE OF ALMOST 3000 VOTES. THAT IS A LOT! THAT IS A LOT OF VOTES. FOR IOWA, THAT IS A LOT OF VOTES.  I THINK IT WAS LIKE SOME LARGE AMOUNT OF VOTES. IT WAS NOT REALLY CLOSE. BUT HE CAME IN SECOND. THE  HUMILIATED."" THEY DID NOT REALLY USE THAT WORD. THEY DID NOT DO THAT WELL. I'M SAYING, HOW COME THE GUY THAT COMES IN THIRD, AND HE IS A PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN, I BEAT HIM BY A LOT, HOW COME THE GUY THAT COMES IN THIRD --ISN'T THIS  TYPICAL REPORTERS, MEDIA, -- THE  WORST PEOPLE EVER, THE WORST.   HOW COME THE  PERSON THAT COMES IN THIRD ON MANY OF THE NETWORKS IS BEING COVERED LIKE IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT VICTORIES IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS IN THIS COUNTRY, AND THE PERSON THAT IS NOT A PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN -- I AM A JOB CREATOR, I BUILD GREAT COMPANIES, I BUILD GREAT BUILDINGS, I DO A LOT OF GREAT THINGS --   I DON'T DO THIS  CRAP. I HAVE EMPLOYED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS. I AM SO PROUD OF THE COMPANY. I HAVE BUILT AN UNBELIEVABLE COUNTRY.  COMPANY. WHEN I DID THE FILING WITH THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMITTEE, SEE ALL OF THOSE CAMERAS BACK THERE? TRIPLE THEM. FIRST THEY SAID I WILL NEVER RUN, RIGHT? AND THEN THEY SAID HE WILL NEVER  FILED FOR MAY.  THAT IS WHERE YOU SIGN YOUR LIFE AWAY, YOU GIVE UP EVERYTHING COULD THE FAMILY, THE DOG, THE HOUSE. YOU GIVE UP THE WORLD. THEY SAID HE WILL NEVER FILED FOR MAINE. OH, HE ANNOUNCED. THEY DID NOT BELIEVE ME. THEY SAID HE WILL NEVER FILE HIS FINANCIALS. IF YOU DID, YOU WILL GET AN EXTENSION BECAUSE YOU CAN GET AN EXTENSION GOES FOREVER. I DID NOT WANT AN EXTENSION. I TOLD ONE OF THE BEST FIRMS IN THE WORLD, I SAID YOU'VE GOT TO GET THESE DONE. I FILED ALMOST 100 PAGES. BIGGER THAN ANYTHING EVER FILED WITH FEDERAL ELECTION BY FAR. THESE POLITICIANS PUT ONE PAGE IN AND NEED FIVE EXTENSIONS. YOU KNOW WHY? THEY ARE AFRAID SOMEBODY KNOWS ABOUT THE CASH THEY HAVE BEEN TAKING.  THEY WANT TO BE CAREFUL. THEY WANT TO BE CAREFUL.   POLITICIANS, ALL TOPPED, NO ACTION -- ALL TALK,  NO ACTION.  I LOVE YOU TOO, DARLING. WHAT HAPPENS IS I GO IN AND  FILE. THEY COME BACK AND SAY, I DON'T BELIEVE IT. THE COMPANY IS MUCH BIGGER, MUCH BETTER. SOME OF THE GREATEST ASSETS IN THE WORLD, BUILDINGS IN MANHATTAN, BANK OF AMERICA BUILDING, A BIG CHUNK IN SAN FRANCISCO, SOME OF THE GREATEST -- ASSETS, SO MANY GREAT ASSETS, HUNDREDS OF ACRES OF MIAMI BEACH, SO MANY. THEY ARE LOOKING. VERY LITTLE BIT, ALMOST NO DEBT. LOW DEBT. TREMENDOUS CASH FLOW, AND SOME OF THE GREATEST ASSETS IN THE WORLD. THE NUMBER IS THROUGH THE ROOF. I AM NOT SAYING THAT TO BE  BRAGGADOCIO IS. I'M SAYING THAT IS WHAT WE NEED IN THIS COUNTRY. OUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO HELL.   THE PRESS GOES  DOWN AND THEY SEE IT. IT WAS SUCH A DUD. THEY WOULD NEVER SAY IT. THEY ALSO I WOULD NOT FILE AND I WOULD NOT RUN BECAUSE MAYBE I AM NOT AS RICH AS PEOPLE THINK I'M A RIGHT? THAT IS WHAT THEY SAID.    I AM WONDERING IF  THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN AT A TRUMP RALLY,. THAT COULD BE THE WAY WE GET THEM TO TURN THE CAMERAS, RIGHT? WHAT THE CAMERAS DON'T HAVE AND WHAT THE PRESS WILL NEVER REPORT IS THE CROWDS. THEY DON'T DO IT. THEY REPORT IT FOR BERNIE. RECENTLY, I HAD 12,000 PEOPLE HE HAD 3000 PEOPLE. THEY SAID BERNIE SANDERS HAD AN AMAZING CROWD OF 3000 PEOPLE. I HAD 12,000. WHEN IT IS MY TURN TO GO, ""DONALD TRUMP MADE A SPEECH TODAY IN FRONT OF A CROWD."" UNBELIEVABLE.   IT IS SO DISHONEST. I HAVE FRIENDS THAT ARE REPORTERS AND THEY TELL ME THEY CANNOT REPORT THE TRUTH. THEY CANNOT REPORT THE TRUTH. THEY ARE TOLD WHAT TO DO. IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE ON OUR SIDE OF THE EQUATION, FOR THE MOST PART THEY ARE VERY DISHONEST. WHAT I DO LIKE IS WHEN THAT MAN HOLDS UP THAT SIGN -- OH, BY THE WAY, I SHOULD REPRIMAND HIM. REMEMBER WHEN I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT? SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT THAT NICE TO OUR PRESIDENT.  AND THEY SAID, ""DONALD TRUMP DID  NOT DEFEND THE PRESIDENT."" DO YOU THINK HE WOULD DEFEND ME? THEY SAID DONALD TRUMP DID NOT  DEFEND THE PRESIDENT. I SAID, OH, OK. THEY SAID I SHOULD HAVE DEFENDED HIM AND I SHOULD HAVE DONE  SOMETHING. SIR, YOU ARE REPRIMANDED, OK?    BUT WE ARE NOT THROWING HIM OUT, FOLKS.   SO I PUT IN THE STATEMENTS, AND THEY HAVE BEEN GREAT. I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE FILED THEM EVEN IF I DID NOT RUN. IT TAKES GUTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. IT REALLY DOES.  IT TAKES GUTS. IT TAKES GUTS. IF YOU ARE A POLITICIAN, YOU  RUN, YOU RUN, YOU LOSE, YOU RUN. THAT IS ALL THEY DO. WITH US, IT TAKES COURAGE. BUT WE NEEDED ONE OF US. WE HAVE TO DO IT. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE WRONG. SO, I WANTED TO JUST TELL YOU -- AND I FEEL SO GOOD. WHILE I HAVE THE CAMERAS GOING, I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF A COUPLE OF THINGS. FOR THE VETERANS, CARL ICAHN, I WILL PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF  NEGOTIATING WITH CHINA. WE WILL STOP THEIR $500 BILLION TRADE DEFICIT, I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW.   BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS. GOOD GUY, TOUGH GUY, SMART GUY. THAT IS THE KIND OF PEOPLE WE WANT. HE IS WORTH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. DOES NOT WANT ANYTHING. HE WOULD LOVE TO REPRESENT US. LET'S PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF CHINA, JAPAN, ONE OR TWO COUNTRIES, PROBABLY ONE BECAUSE WE HAVE GREAT PEOPLE. WE HAVE THE GREATEST NEGOTIATORS IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE THE SMARTEST BUSINESS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. WE DON'T USE THEM. WE AS POLITICAL HACKS, WE AS PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE A CLUE. WE USE PEOPLE THAT GOT THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY GIVE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE GUYS. THAT IS HOW THEY GET THEIR JOBS. THEY DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THE COUNTRY. THEY CARE ABOUT THEMSELVES. THAT IS NOT THE WAY IT IS GOING TO WORK. CARL ICAHN, GREAT BUSINESSMAN, GAVE $500,000 TO THE VETS.   NOW THIS WAS WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DEBATING. BIG DEAL. THIS IS WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE UP DEBATING. WE HAVE STEVE ROTH WHO GAVE $50,000. THE FISHER FAMILY GAVE $75,000. RICHARD GAVE $100,000. DID YOU EVER HEAR OF DONALD TRUMP?   DONALD TRUMP GAVE $1 MILLION.   WE HAVE A RICH GUY FROM NEW YORK CITY. A FRIEND OF MINE, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. THIS GUY WAS THE WORST BRAGGART I HAVE EVER SEEN. IF YOU GAVE MONEY, HE WANTED HIS NAME UP IN LIGHTS. ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE BECAME  PLEASE, DON'T TELL MY NAME. I'M SAYING WHY, THE GUY IS LOADED BY THE WAY, HE SAID BECAUSE I HAVE CHANGED. SEE, PEOPLE CAN CHANGE. I HAVE CHANGED A LITTLE BIT. PEOPLE CAN CHANGE. I SAID IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO NAME IT, I WANT. ""RICH GUY FROM NEW YORK CITY,"" $1 MILLION FOR THE VETS.   ONE OF THE GREAT BUSINESSMAN IN THIS COUNTRY, MR. FILL ROUGH AND, AND HIS INCREDIBLE LIWIFE GAVE $1 MILLION TO THE VETS.  ISN'T THAT GREAT?   IKE FROM MARVEL, A GREAT GENIUS, HIS WIFE IS INCREDIBLE, $1 MILLION TO THE VET. -- VETS. OK?   ISN'T THAT GREAT? AND THERE ARE MANY MORE. I WANT TO TELL YOU IT WAS SUCH AN AMAZING THING. I TOLD THESE PEOPLE. COULD YOU GIVE HALF A MILLION? THESE ARE REALLY SUCCESSFUL  PEOPLE. I SAID, COULD YOU GIVE HALF A MILLION? HE GOES NO, I WON'T. I WILL GIVE $1 MILLION. I SAID I WILL TAKE IT ON BEHALF OF THE VETS. WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS HAPPENING. THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE IN IOWA WAS GREAT. THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THE PRESS DID NOT TREAT ME RIGHT. I'M FOCUSED HERE AND HAVE BEEN FOCUSED HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA VERY MUCH. INSTEAD OF SAYING ""UNBELIEVABLE JOB,"" THEY SAID TRUMP DID ALL RIGHT. A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED. THIRD-PLACE WAS FANTASTIC BUT A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING.  IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS . I LEARNED A LOT AND MADE GREAT FRIENDS IN IOWA. THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE. A LOT OF US ARE BUSINESS PEOPLE. WE WANT TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN.   SUCH A GREAT THEME. IS THAT THE GREATEST OF ALL THEMES? SOMEBODY SAID WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO FOR THE COUNTRY? THIS IS A RADIO PERSON. WHERE IS HOWIE? WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU? IS HE A GREAT GUY? WE LOVE HOWIE CARR. WHO ELSE DO WE LOVE? WE LOVE TOM BRADY. WE LOVE TOM BRADY, RIGHT? [CHEERS AND  AND WE LOVE COACH BELICHICK. I'M TELLING YOU, HE IS THE GREATEST COACH. DON'T EVER LOSE HIM. TOM IS A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE, A GREAT GUY. HE HAS SAID THE NICEST THINGS ABOUT ME. IN MASSACHUSETTS, MY POLL NUMBERS WENT UP 25 POINTS  BECAUSE TOM BRADY SAID TRUMP IS GREAT. THAT IS GOOD.   YOU DON'T OFTEN GET MANY PEOPLE THAT SAY SOMETHING NICE WHEN IT HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT, BUT TOM IS IN THAT CATEGORY. WHERE IS HOW A CAR -- HOWIE CARR? HE HAS THE RADIO GOING. HE HAS BEEN SO NICE TO ME. THANK YOU, HOWIE. WE LOVE YOU. HE IS A GREAT GUY. HERE IS THE FINAL ON THAT WHOLE THING. IN TERMS OF MONEY SPENT PER VOTE, STATS, MONEY SPENT PER VOTE, I WAS ALMOST THE LAST IN IOWA. THERE IS SOMETHING NICE ABOUT THAT. AS AN EXAMPLE ON THE CAMPAIGN, I AM SELF-FUNDING. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? LET ME TELL YOU BECAUSE I SAID IT BEFORE. I TOLD IT TO THE PRESS. THEY WILL MAKE IT A BIG STORY PROBABLY AND THEN CHANGE IT.   WE HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE. I SAID I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU. I DON'T THINK I HAVE GOTTEN THE PROPER CREDIT FOR THE FACT THAT I AM SELF-FUNDING. I DON'T THINK IT MEANS ANYTHING TO ANYBODY.   REALLY. BUSH HAS $128 MILLION HE GOT. WOULDN'T HE HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF JUST TAKING THE MONEY AND THROWING IT OUT A WINDOW OR SOMETHING?   BUT IF YOU LOOK AT TED CRUZ, HE HAS GOT TREMENDOUS MONEY FROM THE OIL COMPANIES. HE IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THE OIL COMPANIES AND WALL STREET. IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE, ALL OF THEM, THEY ALL HAVE MONEY. IT IS ALL FROM WALL STREET, OIL, DIFFERENT THINGS. THOSE PEOPLE ARE 100% LIKE A LITTLE PUPPET. THEY WILL TAKE CARE OF THOSE INTERESTS.  WITH ME, I HAVE NOBODY. I JUST WANT TO TAKE CARE OF YOU. I JUST WANT TO DO THE RIGHT  BUT I SAID SOMETHING AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE. I DON'T THINK THEY KNEW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. SOME ARE SMART, BUT SOME OF THESE GUYS ARE DUMB AS A ROCK.   YOU KNOW, WHEN THIS MAN LIFTED UP THE SIGN, I LIKED IT FOR ONE REASON -- BECAUSE THEY HAD TO MOVE THE CAMERAS AROUND TO SEE THE CROWD. THE ONLY WAY THEY SEE THE CROWD -- IF WE HAVE PROTESTERS, I LOVE IT. I'M THINKING ABOUT DOING IT. I'M GOING TO SET MY PROTESTERS UP AND CORNERS OF ROOMS BECAUSE  THOSE CAMERAS NEVER MOVED FROM  MY FACE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT  TO SHOW HOW WE PEOPLE I HAVE. THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOW THE  MOVEMENT. WE HAVE A MOVEMENT GOING FOR US. WE HAVE A MOVEMENT.   AND I HAVE TO BE HONEST.  I WANT TO THANK THEM BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. SCOTT BROWN, FOR HIM TO COME UP AND SAY I LOVE WHAT YOU ARE DOING, I LOVE WHERE YOU ARE GOING. HE LOVES THIS AREA, AND HE LOVES YOU PEOPLE. FOR HIM TO ENDORSE ME IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING.   WHEREVER SCOTT IS, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. I HAVE OTHER GREAT, IMPORTANT --  JERRY FALWELL JUNIOR, WHO IS FANTASTIC, SARAH PALIN GAVE US A TREMENDOUS ENDORSEMENT. TREMENDOUS. YOU KNOW WHO GAVE ME A GREAT ENDORSEMENT THAT YOU PEOPLE ARE REALLY GOING TO LIKE? CHERYL JOE FROM ARIZONA.   OK? SHERIFF JOE. YOU KNOW WHEN SHERIFF JOE GIVES YOU AN ENDORSEMENT, AND YOU KNOW YOU ARE THE KING OF THE BORDER, RIGHT?  ALL OF THESE OTHER GUYS I AM COMPETING AGAINST, THEY ARE ALL COMING UP AND SAYING WHEN I ORIGINALLY ANNOUNCED, I TALKED ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. AND DID I TAKE HEAT. IF I DID NOT BRING IT UP, IT WOULD NOT EVEN BE A SUBJECT RIGHT NOW. I SAID THIS CANNOT BE LIKE THIS. YOU CANNOT GO ON LIKE THIS FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS. NO HUMAN BEING CAN TAKE THIS AMOUNT OF INCOMING.  NO HUMAN BEING. THEY WERE JUST GOING AFTER ME. THEY SAID IT IS TERRIBLE. AFTER TWO OR THREE WEEKS, PEOPLE STARTED SAYING TRUMP HAS A POINT. HE HAS A POINT. NOW THEY ARE COMING. FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS GO BY. YOU SEE THE TREMENDOUS CRIME COMMITTED BY THE PEOPLE COME INTO OUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. TREMENDOUS CRIME.  THEN YOU HAVE THE KILLING OF YOUTHFUL KATE IN SAN FRANCISCO. THEN YOU HAVE THE KILLING OF JAMIL. YOU HAVE THE KILLING OF THE WOMAN, A 65-YEAR-OLD VETERAN WHO WAS RAPED, SODOMIZED, AND KILLED BY AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT.  THAT IS THREE PEOPLE. YOU HAVE TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW BAD IT IS. NOT ONLY THAT, THE ECONOMY.  I WANT PEOPLE TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY. BUT I WANT THEM TO COME IN LEGALLY.  THEY HAVE TO COME IN LEGALLY.   THEY HAVE TO COME IN LEGALLY. SO, WE HAVE ALL OF THESE ENDORSEMENTS. THEY ARE INCREDIBLE  ENDORSEMENTS. BUT I DO HAVE TO SAY, ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN I AM COMPETING AGAINST, MY WIFE WAS WATCHING TELEVISION THE OTHER DAY AND LISTENING TO THIS GUY, BORING, FALLING ASLEEP. IT IS LIKE A SLEEPER. HE SAID -- I WANT USE THE NAME BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS ANYBODY. HE SAID, ""AND WE WILL BUILD A WALL."" SHE SAID, DARLING, COME HERE, LISTEN. HE JUST SAID WE ARE GOING TO  BUILD A WALL. WHOEVER HEARD OF BUILDING A WALL EXCEPT FOR ME? THEY DON'T GIVE US CREDIT. WHEN I SAID IN IRAQ, TAKE THE  OIL. FOR FOUR YEARS, I'VE BEEN SAYING  TAKE THE OIL. THEN AFTER THE HORRIBLE PARIS ATTACKS, ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY SAID, ""WE'LL TAKE THE OIL."" THE PROBLEM IS THEY ARE FOUR YEARS LATE. WHEN I SAID TAKE THE OIL, I MEAN TAKE IT. THEY MEAN BLOW IT UP. I SAY TAKE IT AND GIVE SOME OF THE PROFITS TO OUR WOUNDED WARRIORS, TO THE VETS, AND THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE LOST PEOPLE IN IRAQ.   I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR FOUR YEARS. ""TAKE THE OIL."" AND YOU KNOW IT. BUT THEY ARE NOT DOING IT RIGHT. THEY DON'T WANT TO BOMB THE OIL  BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A POLLUTION EVENT. IT WOULD BE AN EVENT OF POLLUTION, AS THEY SAY. IT WILL ADD TO THE CARBON FOOTPRINT! THIS IS THE WAY WE FIGHT OUR WARS. DO YOU THINK GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR IS TO HAVE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT IN MIND WHEN HE BOMBED? RIGHT? HOW ABOUT GENERAL PATTON? DID HE THINK, UH OH, THE CARBON FOOTPRINT? GENERAL PATTON, IF YOU MENTIONED THE CARBON FOOTPRINT, HE WOULD SMACK YOU IN THE FACE. I'M NOT SURE I BELIEVE IT, BUT I THINK I BELIEVE IT. THEY SAID ONE OF THE REASONS WE  ARE NOT BOMBING THE OIL IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THAT POLLUTION GOING UP INTO THE  ATMOSPHERE. THE WHOLE THING IS RIDICULOUS. DON'T FORGET. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT THINKS  GLOBAL WARMING -- NOW THERE ARE MANY NAMES. THIS GLOBAL WARMING. THAT WAS NOT WORKING SO WELL. RIGHT? CLIMATE CHANGE. EXTREME WEATHER. THE NEW ONE IS EXTREME WEATHER. HOW CAN YOU MISS THE EXTREME WEATHER. EVEN IF IT IS NICE, YOU SAY IT  IS EXTREMELY BECAUSE IT SHOULD NOT BE THIS NICE. GLOBAL WARMING WAS JUST NOT WORKING. THEN THEY WENT CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT WAS BETTER, BUT EXTREME WEATHER IS LIKE PERFECT. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT TALKS ABOUT THE BIGGEST ENEMY OF THE UNITED STATES. THE NUMBER ONE ENEMY IS -- HE CALLS IT GLOBAL WARMING. GLOBAL WARMING. CLIMATE CHANGE. ONE OF THOSE THINGS. HE DOESN'T KNOW. ANY MEANING MINING THE -- EENY MEENY MINEY MO. HE DOESN'T KNOW. CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE CARBON FOOTPRINT. HE SAID BEFORE CHRISTMAS -- BY  THE WAY, DON'T YOU WANT TO GO, MERRY CHRISTMAS? MERRY CHRISTMAS.  WE ARE GOING TO BRING CHRISTMAS BACK.  MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY HOLIDAY.  WE ARE GOING TO BRING IT BACK. YOU CAN'T SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS ANYMORE. YOU WILL SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN VERY QUICKLY, BELIEVE ME.   BUT FOR CHRISTMAS  OR WHATEVER HE CELEBRATES, HE GETS INTO A BOEING, A VERY OLD -- IT IS CALLED AIR FORCE ONE -- A VERY OLD BOEING 747 WITH THE  OLD ENGINES SPEWING CARBON AND EVERY OTHER THING. I DON'T THINK IT HAPPENS TO HIT -- HURT THE AIR PERSONALLY, BUT  THAT IS OK. THESE OLD ENGINES ARE SPEWING  INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. THINK ABOUT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT. BUT HE'S ONLY GOING TO HAWAII. HE'S GOING FROM WASHINGTON TO  HAWAII. THESE GOING TO PLAY GOLF. HE PLAYS MORE GOLF THAN PEOPLE ON THE PGA TOUR. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? THEY SAY IF THEY COULD PLAY THAT MUCH, THEY WOULD BE EVEN BETTER PLAYERS. HE IS TAKING THE BOEING 747, FLYING TO HAWAII. YOU KNOW HOW LONG THAT IS? OLD ENGINES, THESE ARE THE BIG, OLD ENGINES SPEWING FUMES. THESE OVER THERE FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS PLAYING GOLF. HE FLIES BACK TO WASHINGTON. THEN HE COMES BACK AND TALKS ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING IS OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM. SOMEHOW I THINK ISIS, RUSSIA, RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS -- RIGHT?  THIS MANIAC FROM  NORTH KOREA. SOMEHOW, I THINK THAT IS A BIGGER THREAT THAN GLOBAL WARMING RIGHT NOW.  OK?   THE ONLY GLOBAL WARMING WE SHOULD BE FEARING IS GLOBAL WARMING CAUSED BY NUCLEAR WEAPONS. AND IF WE ARE NOT SMART, THAT IS  WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. WE BETTER GET REALLY TOUGH, REALLY SMART, REALLY VIGILANT OR WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM. WE BETTER STOP PLAYING GAMES, BELIEVE ME. WE BETTER STOP PLAYING GAMES.   SO, WE HAVE BECOME THE POLICEMEN TO THE ENTIRE WORLD. WE TAKE CARE OF THE WORLD. THEY PAY US PEANUTS. WE TAKE CARE OF JAPAN. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT. HERE IS THE DEALS WE MAKE. IF WE ARE ATTACKED, SO MANY ATTACKS US, WOULDN'T YOU RATHER HAVE TRUMP AS PRESIDENT IF WE ARE ATTACKED? WE WILL BE THE -- OUT OF THEM. IF ANYBODY ATTACKS US.   YOU KNOW, SPEAKING OF POTENTIAL, BECAUSE HE HATES OBAMA SO MUCH. PUTIN. HE SAID DONALD TRUMP IS A GENIUS AND HE IS THE REAL LEADER OVER IN THAT COUNTRY. THESE PEOPLE I AM NEGOTIATING  WITH ALL THE TIME. THEY SAID YOU SHOULD DISAVOW WHAT PUTIN OF RUSSIA SAID. I SAID I AM NOT DISAVOWING HE CALLED ME A GENIUS. ARE YOU CRAZY?   DON'T WORRY. I CANNOT BE SEDUCED. BUT WOULDN'T IT BE NICE, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF WE GOT ALONG WITH RUSSIA AND OTHERS AND WE CAN USE THEM TO KNOCKOUT ISIS WITH US SO THAT MAYBE WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO  PAY FOR IT? KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF IT BUT LET THEM DROP SOME OF THEIR BOMBS THAT COST $1 MILLION APIECE? LET THEM USE SOME OF THEIR WEAPONS THAT COST BILLIONS AND  BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. LET THEM BEAT THE -- OUT OF ISIS  ALSO. RIGHT?   SO CRAZY. BY THE WAY, I HAVE TO SAY THANK YOU. LOOK AT AL, MY NUMBER ONE VET. IS AL TAKING GOOD CARE OF YOU? IF HE DOES NOT TAKE CARE OF YOU, I WILL SAY ""AL, YOU ARE FIRED, GET OUT OF HERE."" AL IS A GREAT GUY. HE HAS BECOME MY FRIEND . WE ARE GOING TO BUILD OUR MILITARY SO STRONG NOBODY WILL MESS WITH IT. JEB BUSH AND HILLARY CLINTON ON  THE SAME DAY SAID I DON'T LIKE  DONALD TRUMP'S TONE. THAT DAY, THREE HEADS WERE CHOPPED OFF IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT MY TONGUE. DON'T FORGET THIS.  THIS IS IMPORTANT. I AM THE ONE THAT DID NOT WANT TO GO AND RATE IRAQ. I SAID YOU WILL DESTABILIZE THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST. THAT WAS REUTERS IN 2004 AND BEFORE THAT. I SAID DON'T DO IT, YOU'RE GOING TO DESTABILIZE. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. THE MIDDLE EAST IS TOTALLY DESTABILIZED. IRAN, WHICH MADE ONE OF THE GREAT DEALS EVER WITH $150 BILLION, THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THEY ARE GOING TO SELF-INSPECT. HOW ABOUT THAT? WE HEAR --HERE IS OUR PRESIDENT -- WE HEAR THAT YOU ARE MAKING  NUCLEAR WEAPONS. PLEASE CHECK THE AREA AND CALL ME BACK TOMORROW.   PRESIDENT OBAMA, I  GIVE YOU MY WORD, WE JUST SELF-INSPECTED, WE ARE NOT EVER GOING TO MAKE NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THOSE AREAS. AND THEN THE GUYS GOING, RIGHT? ISN'T IT SICK, ISN'T IT CRAZY? THEN THEY HAVE THE OTHER 24-DAY PERIOD. IF WE THINK THEY ARE MAKING  NUCLEAR WEAPONS, WE HAVE TO  INFORM THEM, THE CLOCK STARTS TICKING IN A MONTH, FIVE MONTHS, BEFORE THE 24 DAYS KICKS IN. THIS THING COULD GO ON FOREVER. IN THE MEANTIME, THEY CLEAN IT UP. THEY SAY 24 DAYS WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH TO CLEAN UP ANYTHING. AND PAINT THE FLOOR BATTLESHIP GRAY SO WHEN WE WALK IN, WE SAY NOTHING IS HAPPENING HERE. THEY GET 24 DAYS. THIS IS THE DUMBEST AGREEMENT I HAVE EVER SEEN DONE BY YOUR MAN KERRY, FROM THIS AREA.  IS HE THE WORST NEGOTIATOR? I HEAR HE WANTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IF HILLARY GETS PUT IN PRISON.   THAT IS WHAT I HEAR. HE CAN'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT.  THAT DEAL IS SO BAD. I WOULD LOVE TO RUN, I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TALK L.L.C. HE HAS MESSED UP -- TALK ABOUT HOW ELSE  HE HAS MESSED UP. WE PAID $150 BILLION FOR FOUR PRISONERS.  THE MOST AMAZING THING. YOU WOULD NOT HAVE STARTED. 95% IN THIS AUDIENCE WOULD HAVE  WALKED IN AND SAID WE WANT OUR  PRISONERS BACK. THIS IS LIKE FOUR YEARS AGO. THIS IS THE LONGEST RUN THE -- RUNNING DEAL I HAVE EVER SEEN. THEY WOULD HAVE SAID NO. YOU WOULD HAVE DOUBLE THE SANCTIONS. THEY WOULD HAVE CALLED YOU BACK ON MOST IMMEDIATELY AND SAID  TAKE YOUR PRISONERS. WE HAVE OUR PRISONERS. YOU MAKE SURE THE PRISONERS HAVE  LANDED. THE PRISONERS HAVE LANDED. THIS IS THE ART OF THE DEAL, BY  THE WAY. NOW YOU GO AND SAY -- MY FATHER USED TO SAY, SON, YOU ARE TOO TOUGH, TRY TAKING THE LUMPS OUT. BE NICE. INSTEAD OF SAYING, ""WE ARE NOT GIVING YOU $150 BILLION"" -- YOU  DON'T WANT TO SAY IT THAT WAY, TOO TOUGH, TOO CHALLENGING. YOU WANT TO SAY IT THIS WAY. ""FELLOWS, WE HAVE GOT A PROBLEM.""   $19 BILLION, OUR STUPID PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON JUST APPROVED A BUDGET THREE WEEKS AGO.  HOW ABOUT THAT BUDGET? THEY ARE GETTING EVERYTHING. OBAMA IS A HORRIBLE NEGOTIATOR EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES TO NEGOTIATING WITH THE REPUBLICANS. HE IS A GENIUS AT NEGOTIATING  WITH THE REPUBLICANS. HE IS HORRIBLE WITH A RAN, RUSSIA, CHINA, JAPAN. BUT WITH THE REPUBLICANS, HE GETS EVERYTHING HE WANTS. I DON'T MIND THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE WE KNOW WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM. BUT WE SEND THE REPUBLICANS IN, THEY ARE GOING TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE, 100 DIFFERENT THINGS. THEY ARE GOING TO CUT THE BUDGET, BALANCE THE BUDGET, DO ALL THESE THINGS. THEY GO THERE. WHAT HAPPENS? I TELL THIS STORY. THEY WALK INTO THE BEAUTIFUL HALLS OF CONGRESS AND THEY SEE THE CAPITOL BUILDING. AND THEY LOOK UP AND SEE THE BEAUTIFUL CEILING. AND THEY SEE THE COLUMNS THAT GO SO HARD, BEAUTIFUL MARBLE.  THEY SAY, ALICE OR JIM, LET'S USE ALICE FOR THIS ONE. ALICE, WE HAVE ARRIVED. NOW WE HAVE MADE IT. DO YOU APPROVE AN EXTENSION OF OBAMACARE? DO YOU APPROVE AN EXTENSION OF OBAMACARE? YES, SIR. YES, SIR. IT IS DISGUSTING. BY THE WAY, I HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO OBAMACARE FROM THE DAY THEY CONCEIVED IT. TED CRUZ COMES OUT WITH AN AD  THAT I'M IN FAVOR OF OBAMACARE. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? JUST LIKE HE DID WITH CARSON. WITH CARSON, HE SAID LEFT IOWA, HE IS OUT OF THE RACE. VOTE FOR HIM. DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS ONE? HE SAID HE LEFT IOWA. CARSON IS A NICE GUY. BEN IS ALL OF A SUDDEN GETTING  CALLS THAT HE QUIT THE RACE. THESE GUYS SAID HE QUIT THE RACE, HE IS GONE, HE IS OUT.  SEND YOUR VOTES TO HIM. WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE ARE WE DEALING WITH WITH THESE POLITICIANS?  A MADE UP -- A LIAR HONESTLY. MADE UP STORIES. MANY OF YOU KNOW ME. FROM DAY ONE I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE, FROM DAY ONE. WE ARE GOING TO DO IT.   IF YOU REMEMBER, SO IMPORTANT, FROM DAY ONE I HAVE BEEN SAYING REPEAL AND  REPLACE OBAMACARE. I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE $5  BILLION WEBSITE THAT NEVER WORKED FOR YEARS, RIGHT? ALL OF A SUDDEN I SEE AN AD OR SOMETHING, ""DONALD TRUMP IS IN FAVOR OF OBAMACARE."" PEOPLE ARE CALLING.  I THOUGHT YOU WERE AGAINST IT,  THAT IS TOO BAD. THESE POLITICIANS ARE DISHONEST PEOPLE. THEY ARE WORSE THAN REAL ESTATE PEOPLE  THESE ARE TRULY DISHONEST PEOPLE. THEN HE SAID BEN CARSON HAS QUIT THE RACE THE DAY OF THE ELECTION. BEN CARSON HAS QUIT THE RACE! BEN DIDN'T QUIT THE RACE. IN OTHER WORDS, BEN CARSON QUIT AND LET ME HAVE YOUR VOTE. WHAT KIND OF CRAP IS THIS? THEN HE MAKES UP A THING LIKE IT IS ON A GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT. ""FOLLOWED HER VIOLATION -- ""VOTER VIOLATION"" ON TOP. IT GIVES GRADES. F, YOU HAVEN'T VOTED. IT SAYS YOU CAN GO VOTE, BUT YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR HIM. PEOPLE ARE AFRAID. I AM IN VIOLATION. I HAVE TO GO VOTE. WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE ARE THESE  PEOPLE? AND THEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN  IOWA IS INVESTIGATING, BUT BY THAT TIME THE ELECTION IS OVER. WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE DO WE HAVE RUNNING FOR OFFICE? IT IS HONESTLY, REALLY  DISHONEST. AND I THINK I KNOW WHY. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE HE WAS BORN IN CANADA!   HE WAS. HAPPENS TO BE A PROBLEM, FOLKS. YOU WATCH. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE ALREADY SAID THEY WILL SUE HIM. IF HE GETS THE NOMINATION, THEY  WILL SUE HIM. ACTUALLY, THEY WILL SUE THE COUNTRY, BUT THEY WILL SUE THEM. THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM. WHILE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IOWA,  PRICE PER HEAD, PROVOKE, LEADING  THE PACK -- HOW DID YOU KNOW? BUSH GOT 1% OR 2%. LEADING THE PACK, THE MAN THAT SPENT THE MOST MONEY PER VOTE, THE LEGENDARY JEB BUSH WITH A  NUMBER OF -- THIS IS PER VOTE -- NO, BUT YOU ARE NOT FAR OFF. $2884 PER VOTE. YOU KNOW, YOU COULD HAVE WON THE ELECTION JUST PROMISING EVERYBODY $1000 AND YOU WOULD HAVE SAVED MONEY. YOU WOULD HAVE WON. YOU WOULD HAVE SAVED A LOT OF MONEY. JEB BUSH SPENT ALMOST $3000 A  VOTE. THAT HAS GOT TO BE A RECORD. WOULD YOU CHECK THE GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS? YOU HAVE OTHERS WITH TREMENDOUS NUMBERS. MARCUS SPENT ALMOST $3000 A VOTE, BUT AT LEAST HE HAD A GOOD RESULT. HE CAME IN THIRD.   NO, HE HAD A  FANTASTIC RESULT. UNBELIEVABLE, HE CAME IN THIRD. THE GUY WHO CAME IN SECOND, TERRIBLE NIGHT.   DISHONEST PEOPLE.   DISHONEST PEOPLE. LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS. HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS. JEB PAID CLOSE TO $3000 A VOTE. WHO IS ONE OF THE LOWEST? I AM JUST ABOUT THE LOWEST. THE LOWEST? THE GREAT DONALD TRUMP. THE GREAT DONALD TRUMP.   BY THE WAY, I'M VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT I HAVE SPENT LESS MONEY THAN JUST ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE ON THE CAMPAIGN. I'M GOING TO START SPENDING A LOT FOR TWO REASONS. NUMBER ONE, I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY CHANCES. NUMBER TWO, I FEEL GUILTY BECAUSE WHEN JEB HAS NOW SPENT $119 MILLION OR SOME RIDICULOUS NUMBER AND MUCH OF IT IS EARMARKED TO ME, ADS,HEY  CANNOT BE VERY GOOD BECAUSE  EVERY TIME HE TAKES AN AD, MY NUMBERS GO UP. IT IS A CRAZY DEAL.   NATIONALLY, I AM LEAVING EVERY POLL. HONESTLY, OTHER THAN IOWA. I'M LEADING THE STATES, LEADING HERE TREMENDOUSLY. BUT EVERY SINGLE NATIONAL POLL,  I AM LEAVING. AND JUST ABOUT EVERY STATE POLL, I AM LEADING. I SPENT THE LEAST AND I HAVE THE  ISN'T THAT NICE? NOW, OTHERS LIKE JEB AND A COUPLE OF OTHERS HAVE SPENT THE MOST, AND THEY HAVE THE WORST RESULT. HOW CAN YOU PUT THEM IN CHARGE?  THINK OF THIS. WE HAVE A SCHOOL SYSTEM. WE ARE GETTING RID OF COMMON CORE, BY THE WAY.   EDUCATION IN THE  UNITED STATES IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PER PEOPLE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.  RIGHT? THE MOST EXPENSIVE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD, AND THERE IS NO SECOND PLACE BECAUSE IT IS SO MUCH  LOWER IT IS RIDICULOUS. NORWAY, DENMARK, SWEDEN, CHINA,  THESE ARE LIKE THE TOP FOUR OR FIVE PLACES FOR EDUCATION. WE ARE NUMBER 30. I USED TO SAY 28. WE JUST WENT UP TWO NOTCHES. WE ARE NOW 30 IN THE WORLD. HUSBAND THE MOST PER-PUPIL BY  FAR AND HAVE THE WORST EDUCATION BY FAR. WE ARE NOW NUMBER 30 AND SPEND THE MOST. WHEN IT BE NICE IF THEY DID LIKE TRUMP, WHERE I SPEND THE LEAST AND HAVE THE BEST RESULTS?   WOULDN'T THAT BE GOOD? SO IMPORTANT.  THAT IS WHAT I MEAN. OUR BUDGET. THEY SAID WE ARE WORKING ON THE BUDGET AND WE THINK WITHIN 25 YEARS, WE CAN BALANCE THE BUDGET. I SAID, 25 YEARS? THESE ARE SERIOUS PEOPLE. THEY SAID 25 YEARS TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. I'M TALKING ABOUT DOING IT RELATIVELY WEEKLY.  WE WILL HAVE A BETTER COUNTRY. WE WILL GET RID OF THE WASTE, FRAUD, ABUSE, ALL OF THE WASTE, THE DISGUSTING WASTE AND THE FROG. YOU LOOK AT THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA. IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT FORMULA SCAMS YOU HAVE EVER SEEN. THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE SUCH GOOD CARE OF THEM. WHAT IS GOING ON IS  UNBELIEVABLE. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SO STRONG AND SOLID. I SAID THE OTHER DAY WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY RICH AGAIN, AND WOMAN SAID THAT DOES NOT SOUND NICE. I SAY WE CANNOT BE GREAT UNLESS WE ARE RICH. WE ARE A DEBTOR NATION. THAT HORRIBLE BUDGET I TOLD YOU  ABOUT IS WORTH $2 TRILLION. THAT TAKES CARE OF OUR BORDER. THAT TAKES CARE OF THE SYRIAN REFUGEES WHO WE ARE NEVER GOING  TO LET IN. I HAVE A BIG HEART, BUT WE ARE NEVER LETTING THEM IN. WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM. IT'S NOT GOING TO  IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. AND ANYBODY THAT COMES IN, I WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW WE HAVE TO SEND THEM BACK. WE CANNOT TAKE CHANCES. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE MISTAKES LIKE THAT. WE HAVE THE TWO PEOPLE THAT WERE RADICALIZED, PROBABLY SHE RADICALIZED HIM, THE MARRIED  COUPLE. OH, GREAT, WHO IN CALIFORNIA KILLED 14 PEOPLE WITH MANY BADLY  INJURED IN THE HOSPITAL. WE DID NOT KNOW THIS. WE DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT  IT. WE HAD PARIS WITH A HAVE THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE WORLD, BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO PRESERVE OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO TOUCH THE SECOND AMENDMENT UNLESS WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT STRONGER.   SO PARIS HAS THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE WORLD,  RIGHT? THE TOUGHEST IN THE WORLD. YOU CAN'T HAVE A GUN. UNLESS YOU ARE A BAD GUY, NO PROBLEM. THESE DISGUSTING THUGS WALK INTO VARIOUS PLACES AND START SHOOTING PEOPLE. BOOMB, BOOM, MOVE OVER, BOOM. 130 DEAD. MANY SO GRAVELY INJURED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE DYING. THEY ARE DYING NOW. OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LIVE A  LIFE OF HELL BECAUSE THEY ARE SO HORRIBLY INJURED.  IF WE HAD A FEW PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, I CAN LOOK AT THEM. THAT GUY RIGHT THERE, HE'S MEAN. IF WE HAD A FEW OF THE PEOPLE, YOU, YOU.  LET ME PICK A WOMAN. YOU. AND IF SOMEBODY HAD A GUN ON THEIR BELT OR SOMEBODY HAD A GUN WRAPPED AROUND HER ANKLE, AND THOSE BULLETS STARTED COMING AT YOU OR YOU SEE THEY WERE GOING TO, AND YOU SHOOT THEM, FOLKS,  THAT IS OUR FORM OF PROTECTION.   YOU WOULDN'T  HAVE THE CARNAGE YOU HAD THERE. HOW ABOUT THE MILITARY BASE? FIVE GREAT YOUNG SOLDIERS. A GUN FREE ZONE. ONE OF THE SOLDIERS IS A WORLD-CLASS MARKSMAN, ONE OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD. THEY ARE ALL TOP OF THE LINE SOLDIERS. THEY ARE TOLD TO DISARM, TAKE  THEIR GUNS, PUT THEM 200 YARDS AWAY. A WHACK JOB WALKS IN. THESE FIVE RATE, BEAUTIFUL  SOLDIERS. TOUGH, SMART, TREMENDOUS FUTURE. THIS WHACK JOB WALKS IN AND BLOWS THEM AWAY, KILLS ALL FIVE OF THEM. THAT WAS IT.  BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? WHEN THESE CRAZY PEOPLE SEE ""GUN FREE ZONE,"" THAT IS LIKE SAYING CANDY TO A BABY. THAT IS CANDY TO A BABY. WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT.  WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OURSELVES.  WE ARE NOT TOUCHING OUR SECOND AMENDMENT.  IT IS UNDER SIEGE.  THEY ARE PLAYING NOW WITH BULLETS. THEY ARE PLAYING WITH MAGAZINES. THEY ARE PLAYING WITH A LOT. WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT.  REMEMBER THAT.   WHEN THIS ALL BEGAN ON JUNE 16 COMING DOWN THE ESCALATOR, IT WAS ALL ABOUT BORDER PROTECTION. SPEAKING OF BORDER PROTECTION, AND COULTER, SHE HAS BEEN SUCH A  GREAT HELP TO ME. WHERE IS OUR ANN? ANN, WHERE ARE YOU? STAND UP. SHE IS STANDING UP.   SHE IS SO GREAT. ""AUDIOS, AMIGO."" BESTSELLER. SHE IS SO GREAT. SHE HAS BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE OF US. SHE WANTS BORDER SECURITY. SHE WANTS PEOPLE TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY LEGALLY. THEY HAVE TO COME IN THROUGH A PROCESS. BUT THERE IS NOBODY STRONGER ON THE SUBJECT. I LOVE THE BOOK. I READ THE BOOK. GO OUT AND BUY THE BOOK,  EVERYBODY. GREAT PERSON.   SHE IS A GREAT PERSON. WHEN I STARTED THIS WHOLE DEAL,  I TALKED ABOUT THAT. I TALKED ABOUT OBAMACARE, REPEALING IT. I TALKED ABOUT THE MILITARY. I TALKED ABOUT THE VETS. I TALKED ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO SAVE OUR SOCIAL SECURITY.  I TALKED ABOUT TRADE LIKE NOBODY ELSE CAN TALK ABOUT TRADE. WHEN CROWE ICON ENDORSES ME AND MANY OF THE BEST BUSINESS PEOPLE  IN THE WORLD WANT TO ENDORSE ME,  I SAY DON'T BOTHER, NOBODY KNOWS WHO YOU ARE. IT IS TRUE. NOT LIKE THE GREAT SCOTT BROWN. NOBODY KNOWS WHO THEY ARE, BUT THEY ARE THE BEST BUSINESS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. WHEN THEY ENDORSE ME, I TALK ABOUT TRADE. CHINA IS MAKING A FORTUNE OFF OF US.  WE CANNOT DO IT. VIETNAM, JAPAN, MEXICO, BOTH AT THE BORDER AND WAS TRAINED. YOU HAVE TO SEE WHAT IS MOVING. NABISCO IS MOVING THE BIG PLAYER FROM CHICAGO TO MEXICO. FOUR IS BUILDING ONE OF THE BIGGEST AUTO PLANTS IN THE WORLD IN MEXICO. WHAT ARE WE DOING? WE ARE BRINGING BACK OUR JOBS. NOW WE HAVE A CASE FOR CORPORATE INVERSION WHERE COMPANIES USED TO MOVE FROM HERE TO FLORIDA OR FROM HERE TO TEXAS OR FROM TEXAS TO HEAR. NOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM. NOW WE HAVE COMPANIES. THEY DON'T WANT TO MOVE TO FLORIDA OR TEXAS. THEY DON'T WANT TO MOVE TO NEW HAMPSHIRE. BOY, HAVE YOU TAKEN A BEATING? YOU TALK ABOUT COMPANIES LEAVING. YOU ARE A PRIME EXAMPLE. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO YOU IS INCREDIBLE. WE ARE GOING TO BRING THEM BACK. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT SO THEY COME BACK. NOW WE HAVE CORPORATE INVERSION  WHERE COMPANIES LIKE PFIZER, GREAT COMPANIES ARE MOVING OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE TAXES ARE TOO HIGH. BY THE WAY, MY BILL, I PUT IN TAX POLICY. BIG CUTS FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. THE MIDDLE CLASS IN THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN DECIMATED.  BIG, BIG CUTS FOR BUSINESS.   WE ARE THE HIGHEST TAXED NATION IN THE WORLD. BIG, BIG CUTS RIGHT NOW, AND IT  IS GOING TO PASS. IT IS GOING TO GO THROUGH. I GET THINGS DONE. IDEA WHAT FOLLOWED -- I DEAL WITH POLITICIANS ALL MY LIFE. WE WILL GET IT PASSED. I USED TO TALK ABOUT THAT. WHEN WE HAD THAT HORRIBLE EVENT IN PARIS, AND WE HAD THE HORRIBLE EVENTS, AS YOU KNOW, IN CALIFORNIA, AND MANY OTHER HOW HERBAL IN EVENTS -- HORRIBLE EVENTS, I BROUGHT UP THE FACT WE HAVE TO START TALKING SERIOUSLY ABOUT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. WE HAVE GOT TO TALK ABOUT IT! I SAID IT, AND IT WAS JUST LIKE  WHAT HAPPENED WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.  I SAID IT. TWO WEEKS LATER, NOW THEY ARE ALL TRAINED TO BE TOUGHER THAN ME. NOBODY CAN BE TOUGHER THAN ME, BY THE WAY. THEY ARE ALL TRYING TO BE TOUGHER THAN ME. NOW I TALK ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION. THERE IS SUCH HATRED OUT THERE. WHEN PEOPLE ARE FLYING AIRPLANES INTO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER,  WHEN PEOPLE ARE DOING ALL OF THESE ACTS ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND I HAVE FRIENDS THAT ARE MUSLIM. THEY CALL ME AND SAY YOU HAVE  DONE A GREAT SERVICE. THERE WAS TREMENDOUS HATRED. YOU CANNOT SOLVE A PROBLEM LIKE THAT UNLESS YOU START TALKING ABOUT IT. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT WILL  NOT EVEN DISCUSS IT OR TALK ABOUT IT OR USE THE WORD. HE WON'T SAY ""RADICAL ISLAMIC  TERRORISM."" IT IS REAL. IT IS A PROBLEM. YOU CAN'T SOLVE A PROBLEM UNLESS  YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT. WE HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS --   I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT, AND NOW EVERYBODY IS  SAYING THANK YOU SO MUCH AND IT IS UNDER DISCUSSION. IT IS A BIG, BIG PROBLEM. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE ARE GOING TO GET IT SOLVED. ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, WE ARE GOING TO GET ITSELF. WE CAN NO LONGER BE THE STUPID COUNTRY. WE CAN NO LONGER BE THE COUNTRY LED BY INCOMPETENT PEOPLE. WE CAN NO LONGER BE THE COUNTRY THAT TAKES SERGEANT BERGDAHL, A  DIRTY ROTTEN TRAITOR, AND TAKE HIM AND SWAP HIM FOR FIVE OF THE BIGGEST KILLERS THEY HAVE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THAT THEY  HAVE COVETED AND WANTED FOR AT LEAST NINE YEARS. THINK OF IT. WE GET BERGDAHL, AND THEY GET THESE FIVE KILLERS THAT ARE ALREADY BACK ON THE BATTLEFIELD TRYING TO KILL EVERYTHING IN FRONT OF THEM, INCLUDING US. WE ARE NOT MAKING DEALS LIKE THAT ANYMORE, FOLKS. WE ARE NOT MAKING DEALS LIKE THAT.   JUST TO FINISH OFF, YOU HAVE TO SEE THE COVER OF ""TIME"" MAGAZINE LAST WEEK. AMAZING COVER. AMAZING WRITER. I NEVER SPOKE TO HIM. I DO BETTER WHEN I DON'T SPEAK TO THE WRITERS. WHEN I SPEAK TO THEM, THEY KILL  ME. BRING THAT APPEAR. -- BRING THAT UP HERE. THROW IT. WEAK ARM. THAT'S OK. YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND GET THIS MAGAZINE. THIS TALK ABOUT OUR MOVEMENT, IT  IS A MOVEMENT. THIS TALKS ABOUT THE MOVEMENT. IN THE OLD DAYS, THEY WOULD HAVE SAID SILENT MAJORITY. IT IS REALLY THE NOISY MAJORITY. PEOPLE ARE ANGRY. THEY ARE UPSET. THEY CANNOT BELIEVE THIS STUFF IS HAPPENING. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SO STRONG. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT SO JUST. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A BIG  HEART. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE. WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT CANNOT TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. WE ARE GOING TO HELP PEOPLE. BUT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SO GOOD. WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING. WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH HEALTH CARE. WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH OUR MILITARY. WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH OUR VETERANS. WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH EVERY  SINGLE THING WE TOUCH. WE ARE GOING TO WIN AGAINST CHINA AND TRADE.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN AGAINST MEXICO AT THE BORDER AND WITH TRADE. WE ARE GOING TO WIN AGAINST JAPAN WHERE THEY SEND US MILLIONS OF CARS AND WE CANNOT SEND ANYTHING OF VALUE BACK TO THEM. WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN.  WE ARE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH.  AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY -- WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS GREAT, GREAT COUNTRY EVEN GREATER. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I LOVE YOU ALL.   I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. WE LOVE YOU.

SIT DOWN PLEASE. WE HAD ABOUT 24 HOURS TO PUT THIS TOGETHER. IT WAS VERY QUICK. WE HAVE SOME SPECIAL PEOPLE AND WE WILL HEAR FROM SOME OF THEM. I DO NOT WANT TO BE HERE, I HAVE TO BE HONEST. I WANTED TO BE FIVE MINUTES AWAY. WE HAVE ENJOYED THAT. THE ONLINE POLLS HAVE GONE WELL, WITH THE DEBATE. BUT YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS. WHEN YOU ARE TREATED BADLY, YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS.  MR. TRUMP: YOU HAVE TO DO IT. WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, THAT IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY HAS TO DO. AS AN EXAMPLE, IRAN. THE WAY THEY HAVE BEEN TREATING US, IT IS ONE OF THE WORST DEALS I HAVE EVER SEEN NEGOTIATED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. WE JUST STICK UP FOR OURSELVES AS PEOPLE AND FOR OUR COUNTRY WHEN WE ARE BEING MISTREATED. REMEMBER THAT.  MR.

IT WOULD JUST BE WRONG. I LOVE IOWA. I DID NOT KNOW WE WOULD RAISE $5 MILLION. WE ACTUALLY RAISED CLOSE TO $6 MILLION, TO BE TOTALLY HONEST. AND A LOT MORE TO COME. WE SET UP A SITE, WWW.DONALDTRUMPFORVETS.COM. THEY HAVE RAISED THE MOST $5,000 JUST TODAY. THIS MONEY WILL CONTINUE TO POUR IN. WE HAVE SOME INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. I WANT TO CALL OUT THE FOLKS THAT GIVE A LOT OF THE MONEY. WE WILL HAVE SOMEONE COME UP TO SPEAK WHO IS AN INCREDIBLE SPEAKER. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT VETS ARE GOING THROUGH. FIRST, WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO MADE A LOT OF MONEY. IF THEY HAD NOT MADE A LOT OF MONEY, THEY WOULD NOT EVEN BE HERE FOR THE VETS. THE MILITARY HAS MORE GUTS THAN YOU DO, RIGHT?

I SAID, IT IS FURTHER V -- FOR THE VETS. HE WANTED TO BE ANONYMOUS. HE HAS CHANGED. YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT. YES?   >> TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP! MR. TRUMP: IT IS TOO CRAZY. I LOVE PROTESTS AT MY RALLIES. WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE TRYING TO GET IN. WE SET UP CAMERAS, SCREENS, EVERYTHING. I WILL TELL YOU -- I LOVE THE PROTESTERS IN THE BIG ARENAS BECAUSE THE CAMERAS NEVER MOVE. THEY ARE ALWAYS ON MY FACE. I SAY TO MY WIFE -- HONEY, STAND UP. SHE HAS TO SUFFER THROUGH THIS.  MR. TRUMP: NO, I GO HOME -- AND IT IS ALWAYS ON. IT IS NOT LIKE THE OTHER POLITICIANS -- NOBODY COVERING THEM. I SAID, HOW DID I DO? SHE SAID, YOU ARE GREAT. HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE THERE? 21,000. IN ALABAMA, WE HAD 35,000 PEOPLE. BY THE WAY, WE GET BIGGER CROWDS BY FAR. MUCH BIGGER THAN BERNIE. THOUGH HE IS SECOND. WE GET THE BIGGEST CROWDS. SHE SAID, THEY NEVER SHOW THE CROWD. I REALIZED, THEY NEVER TURNED THE CAMERA. I SAID, I FIGURED MAYBE THEY ARE FIXED. THEY CANNOT TURN AROUND. THE ONLY WAY YOU FIND OUT THEY ARE NOT FIXED, THEY ARE LIKE PRETZELS, IS WHEN YOU HAVE A PROTESTER. YOU CAN HAVE A PROTESTER UP AT THE TOP, AND THEY TURN. BUT THEY DO NOT WANT TO SHOW A CROWD. WE HAVE A RICH GUY FROM NEW YORK WHO HAS BECOME A LITTLE RECLUSIVE. $1 MILLION. GREAT GUY. WE HAVE ANOTHER UNBELIEVABLE GUY , ONE OF THE GREAT MEN OF OUR COUNTRY IN TERMS OF BUSINESS AND TALENT. IKE AND LAURIE PERLMUTTER, $1 MILLION.  MR. TRUMP: JJ CAFARO FROM FLORIDA, AND A FANTASTIC MAN FROM CLEVELAND. $55,000. ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE, ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT MEN YOU WILL EVER MEET, PHENOMENAL POKER PLAYER. HE DOES NOT DO IT FOR A LIVING. YOU CANNOT MAKE A DEAL WITH THIS GUY AND COME OUT ON TOP. IN FACT, I AM THINKING ABOUT HIM FOR CHINA. HOW ABOUT HIM NEGOTIATING WITH CHINA?  MR. TRUMP: YOU KNOW, CHINA THIS YEAR IN TRADE, WILL MAKE OVER $500 BILLION IN TERMS OF OUR TRADE DEFICIT. $500 BILLION. THAT IS NO PARTNERSHIP. AND I AM A FREE TRADER, BUT WE HAVE TO USE OUR HEADS. WE USE POLITICAL HACKS TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE CHINESE. I DEAL WITH THEM ALL THE TIME. THEY BUY MY APARTMENTS FOR MILLIONS. I LOVE THEM. I AM NOT BLAMING THE CHINESE. I AM NOT ANGRY AT THEM. I AM ANGRY AT OUR POLITICIANS BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE INCOMPETENT RUNNING OUR COUNTRY. WHY SHOULD WE BE LOSING, IN TRADE DEFICITS, $500 BILLION A YEAR? IF I TOOK A GUY LIKE THIS AND PUT HIM IN CHARGE, MR. AND MRS. PHIL RUFFIN, COME ON UP.  MR. TRUMP: COME UP.  MR. TRUMP: HE HAS NEVER HAD ANYTHING -- IT IS LIKE EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES TURNS TO GOLD. YOU PUT A PIECE OF LAND IN LAS VEGAS. $110 MILLION. HE SOLD IT A FEW YEARS LATER FOR $1.43 BILLION. WHEN HE GIVES A MILLION, IT IS LIKE TEN CENTS, BUT STILL VERY IMPORTANT. SAY A COUPLE OF WORDS.  >>  HE ACTUALLY SENT ME A MILLION DOLLARS AND SAID, THERE IS 10 OR 20 MORE IF YOU NEED IT. I SENT IT BACK. I AM SELF FUNDING MY OWN CAMPAIGN, RIGHT? BUT ALL MY LIFE, I MADE MONEY. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GOOD AT MAKING MONEY. ALL MY LIFE, I DID WELL. MY FATHER ALWAYS SAID, EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES TURNS TO GOLD. THAT IS WHY I USED THE SAME EXPRESSION. BUT HE ALWAYS SAID, EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES TURNS TO GOLD. I TURNED ALL THIS MONEY DOWN. THEY ARE CALLING AND CALLING. BEING NUMBER ONE, THEY WANT TO CONTROL YOU. THEY WANT TO GIVE YOU MONEY. REMEMBER I GIVE YOU $5 MILLION? ALL MY LIFE, I AM TURNING DOWN MILLIONS. I WAS IN IOWA AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION. WE HAD 4000 PEOPLE. I SAID, LISTEN. I DO NOT FEEL GOOD ABOUT TURNING DOWN MONEY. MY WHOLE LIFE, I HAVE BEEN GREEDY, GREEDY, GREEDY. BUT NOW I WANT TO BE GREEDY FOR THE UNITED STATES.  MR. TRUMP: I WILL GRAB ALL THAT MONEY. I WILL BE GREEDY FOR THE UNITED STATES. BUT I ALWAYS FEEL GUILTY. THE CROWD IS LOVELY. WE HAVE THE MOST INCREDIBLE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY IN IOWA. THE COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE THIS WEEK IS A COVER STORY. THERE IT IS. HOLD THAT UP. THEY HAVE THE BACK OF MY HEAD WITH A MASSIVE CROWD IN FRONT OF ME. THEY ARE COVERING THE STORY. I DID NOT EVEN KNOW THEY WERE DOING THE STORY. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MOVEMENT. IS ACTUALLY A MOVEMENT. WHAT IS HAPPENING IS, I SAID TO THE CROWD, LET ME ASK YOU THIS ONE THING. COULD I TAKE ALL THIS MONEY? I AM TURNING AWAY SO MUCH MONEY. COULD I TAKE ALL THIS MONEY? EVERYONE WENT CRAZY, NO, NOK,, NO. THERE WAS ONE GUY IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM -- A CROOKED LOOKING GUY -- AND HE SAID, IT IS OK TO TAKE IT. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT GUY. I FEEL A LITTLE BIT FOOLISH NOT TAKING THE MONEY. BUT YOU LOOK AT A GUY LIKE JEB BUSH. LOW-ENERGY. EXTREMELY LOW. HE IS DEBATING RIGHT NOW. MAYBE HE IS DOING GREAT. PROBABLY LOOKING FOR ME. HAS ANYONE SEEN TRUMP? WHERE IS HE?  MR. TRUMP: $120 MILLION. PEOPLE I KNOW LIKE HIM, KILLERS. THEY PUT UP $8 MILLION. THEY ARE LOBBYISTS, SPECIAL INTERESTS. THEY ARE NOT DOING THAT FOR THEIR HEALTH. I KNOW MOST OF THE LOBBYISTS. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE SEVEN MONTHS AGO. I WAS A BIG GIVER. I KNOW THESE PEOPLE. I SAID, BELIEVE ME. WHEN THEY PUT IN $6 MILLION, $1 MILLION, $5 MILLION, THEY WANT SOMETHING FOR IT. WHEN YOU SEE THESE HORRIBLE DEALS BEING MADE, THE POLITICIANS ARE THAT STUPID. YOU SAY, HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IRAN JUST GOT $150 BILLION FROM THIS COUNTRY? ONE OF THE DUMBEST DEALS EVER. THEIR FIRST PURCHASE IS 114 AIRBUS JETS. NOT BOEING. THEN WE HAVE FRANCE. THEY GO TO RUSSIA AND THEREBY MISSILES. PEOPLE SAY THE CLOCK DOES NOT START TAKING -- TICKING. WE DID NOT GET OUR HOSTAGES BACK. THEY HAVE $150 BILLION. SETS A BAD TONE FOR KIDNAPPING. WHO WOULD BELIEVE WHAT IS GOING ON? WHEN YOU SEE THAT AIRBUS GETS OUR JETS AND RUSSIA GETS THE MISSILES, WHICH THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ORDERING -- AND OTHER THINGS FROM RUSSIA, EVERYONE IS GETTING THE MONEY BUT US. WHEN YOU SAY, THAT IS SUCH A STUPID DEAL, HOW CAN ANYBODY BE SO STUPID? THE REASON IS POLITICIANS ARE BEING TAKEN CARE OF BY SPECIAL INTERESTS THAT HAVE INTEREST WITH AIRBUS, WITH RUSSIA AND MISSILES, WITH ALL OF THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE TAKING THAT $150 BILLION. BY THE WAY, WE HAVE MIKE HUCKABEE SITTING HERE. GET UP.  MR. TRUMP: GREAT GUY. SANTORUM. WHERE IS RICK?  MR. TRUMP: FELLAS, COME UP HERE FOR A SECOND. JESSE YOU UNDERSTAND -- JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND, THESE TWO ARE NOT IN THAT CATEGORY. THEY WOULD NEVER DO A THING LIKE THAT.  MR. TRUMP: STAND UP HERE. MRS. HUCKABEE. AND RICK'S DAUGHTER. STAND UP.  MR. TRUMP: THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE A THING LIKE THAT. WHEN YOU SEE A DEAL THAT IS BAD, THEY ARE NOT BAD FOR POLITICIANS. THEY ARE BAD FOR THE COUNTRY. THAT IS WHY I DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING. WE WILL DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU. I WANT TO ASK RICK AND LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS. I HEARD THEY DID VERY WELL, THESE TWO. HOW DID THEY DO? IF YOU DID POORLY, YOU WOULD GO BACK AND BE DEPRESSED. SAY A FEW WORDS.   TWO AMAZING PEOPLE. I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW THEM VERY WELL, BEING ON THE TRAIL, AS THEY SAY. VERY HAPPY WITH WHAT IS GOING ON ON THE TRAIL. I HAVE HAD AN AMAZING PERIOD OF TIME. I USUALLY LIKE TO GET UP AND DO POLLS. MIKE SAID, WHY DO YOU KEEP DOING THOSE? I SAID, BECAUSE THEY ARE SO GOOD. WE HAVE HAD AMAZING POLLS IN IOWA. WE ARE LEADING BY SUBSTANTIAL MARGINS IN IOWA AND EVERY SINGLE STATE. WE ARE LEAVING EVERY NATIONAL POLL.  MR. TRUMP: PEOPLE ARE TIRED AND THEY ARE SICK OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN OUR COUNTRY, HOW OUR MILITARY IS BEING DECIMATED. AS AN EXAMPLE TONIGHT, YOU SEE THE KIND OF AMAZING LOVE. VETERANS ARE THE MOST AMAZING PEOPLE. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS. I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE SOMEBODY WHO WILL SPEAK FOR A LITTLE WHILE. HE WILL INTRODUCE A COUPLE OF HIS FRIENDS. JOHN WAYNE WALDING HAS BECOME A FAMOUS PERSON. SHE SHOULD BE MORE FAMOUS BECAUSE HE IS MORE COURAGEOUS THAN I AM. I AM FINANCIALLY COURAGEOUS, BUT THE OTHER STUFF, I AM NOT SO GOOD. HE SPENT 12 YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY IN THE THIRD SPECIAL FORCES. GREW UP AT FORT BRAGG, NORTH CAROLINA. HE HAS COMBAT DEPLOYMENTS TO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN. DURING HIS CAREER WITH THE THIRD SPECIAL FORCES GROUP, THE BEST, HE WORKED AS A SPECIAL FORCES OPERATOR WITH THE SNIPER TO ATTACHMENT AND IS A SNIPER INSTRUCTOR. HE IS A WORLD-CLASS MARKSMAN. HE DOES SPECIAL FORCES, ADVANCED URBAN COMBAT, NOT EASY. ADVANCED SNIPER, SPECIAL FORCES QUALIFICATIONS COURSES AND AIRBORNE ASSAULT. JOHN'S AWARDS AND BADGES INCLUDE THE SILVER STAR, BRONZE STAR, PURPLE HEART, COMBAT INFANTRY BADGE, AIR FORCE AIR ASSAULT. JOHN ANTICIPATED IN NUMEROUS BATTLES DURING HIS DEPARTMENT. MOST FAMOUS OF ALL WAS THE BATTLE OF SHOCK VALLEY, WHICH WAS A REALLY TOUGH ONE. THE VICTORY WAS BRILLIANT, BUT TREMENDOUS COURAGE -- CARNAGE. WHICH YOU CAN READ ABOUT IN THE NEW BOOK ""NO WAY OUT."" JOHN LOST A LEG. HE IS AN AMAZING GUY. I HEARD HIM SPEAK ONCE BEFORE AND WAS SO IMPRESSED, I ASKED HIM TO COME OVER AND SAY A FEW WORDS. JOHN WAYNE. COME ON.  >>  THAT WAS AMAZING. ISN'T THAT BETTER THAN THIS DEBATE THAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW?  MR. TRUMP: THEY ARE ALL SLEEPING. THEY ARE ALL SLEEPING. EVERYBODY. I SEE TWO OF MY FRIENDS IN THE AUDIENCE AND THEY HAVE COME TO BECOME VERY FAMOUS AND VERY RICH. COME UP. SHE CALLED ME AND SHE SAID, THERE IS SOMEBODY WHO IS SO AMAZING, YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS. AND I WATCHED THESE TWO INCREDIBLE WOMEN, THESE TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, AND I WATCHED THEM GO BACK AND FORTH. CROWD: TRUMP!   JAKE: AMAZING -- MR. PAUL:TRUMP: AMAZING. CROWD: TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP! MR. TRUMP: I REALLY BELIEVED IF WE TOOK THEM INTO A ROOM AND JUST TALKED TO THEM, IT WOULD BE FINE. WE WANT BORDERS, WE WANT THE WALL, IF WE COULD SIT WITH OF THEM  I TELL YOU WHAT. THEY ARE SOMETHING. RIGHT? ARE THEY SOMETHING. THEY HAVE BECOME AND INTERNET SENSATION. SO JUST TO SUM UP, WE HAVE AN AMAZING COUNTRY, WE NEED STRONG LEADERSHIP, WE NEED PASSIONATE LEADERSHIP, WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF OUR HEALTH CARE, WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF OUR BORDERS, WE NEED TO MAKE OUR MILITARY SO STRONG, SO BIG, SO POWERFUL, THAT NOBODY WILL WANT TO MESS WITH IT. NOBODY, NOBODY, NOBODY WILL MESS WITH IT.  MR. TRUMP: ALL OVER, AND I TELL THIS STORY ALL THE TIME, I SEE THESE GENERALS ON TALK SHOWS AND RETIRING AND THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT WHERE THE ENEMY IS AND I DON'T WANT GENERALS TO TALK, I WANT GENERALS, AND SO DO YOU FOLKS, I WANT GENERALS TO HAVE ACTION. WE WANT GENERAL GEORGE PATTON, WE WANT GENERAL MACARTHUR, WE WANT PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO KEEP US SAFE. SO I JUST SAY THIS. WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT DOESN'T WIN ANYMORE. WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT WE WON? WE DON'T WIN IN TRADE, WE DON'T WIN IN THE MILITARY, WE DON'T EAT ISIS, WE DON'T WIN ANYTHING, WE ARE NOT GOOD, WE ARE JUST IN THE SAME PLACE -- WE DON'T BEAT ISIS, WE DON'T WIN ANYTHING, WE ARE NOT GOOD, WE ARE JUST IN THE SAME PLACE. BUT WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE AND COME UP WITH A GREAT, GREAT, POWERFUL, WONDERFUL HEALTH CARE.  MR. TRUMP: WE ARE GOING TO WIN AGAIN. I TELL YOU WHAT, WE ARE GOING TO WIN AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO WIN AT EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE LAU GHED AT THROUGH THE REST OF THE WORLD. THEY CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE SEND GUNS OVER TO OUR WEAPONS. THE ENEMY TAKES THEM AND NOW PEOPLE COME BACK FROM THE MIDDLE EAST AND THEY TELL ME, ""MR. TRUMP, THEY HAVE BETTER WEAPONS THAN WE DO, THEY HAVE THE NEW VERSIONS, THEY HAVE THE BEST WEAPONRY."" I'M HERE TO TELL YOU IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE. IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. SO THIS IS A SPECIAL MIGHT FOR ME. WE STARTED OUT LITERALLY 24 HOURS AGO, MAYBE LESS, WE HAD NO IDEA AND WE WENT OUT AND WE SET UP THE WEBSITE AND I CALLED SOME FRIENDS AND WE JUST CRACKED, THE SIGN WAS JUST GIVEN, AND WE JUST CRACKED $6 MILLION, RIGHT? $6 MILLION!  MR. TRUMP: AND WE HAVE OUTSIDE A LIST OF THE ORGANIZATIONS AND THE FOLKS THAT ARE GOING TO BE KIDDING THIS MONEY. THEY ARE GOING TO DIVIDED UP AND THEY ARE GOING TO GET A LOT OF MONEY, EVERYBODY IS GOING TO GET A LOT OF MONEY, AND THEY ARE VERY GREAT, AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS AND THE PEOPLE ARE SO IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE PICKED OUT SOME REALLY AMAZING, AMAZING VETERANS ORGANIZATIONS. SO THIS HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A MUCH DIFFERENT EVENING. I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE SMALL AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A PHENOMENAL, PHENOMENAL NIGHT. I GOT TO BE SOME VETERANS, I GOT TO MEET JOHN WAYNE AND YOUR FRIENDS, THEY ARE SOMETHING, I AM NOT GOING TO MESS WITH THEM, OK? AND I WANT TO THANK MY ENTIRE FAMILY. I WILL TELL YOU, YOU'VE GOT VANESSA, DON, JARED, SUCCESS. YVONNE TO IS GOING TO HAVE A BABY -- IVANKA'S GUIDE HAVE A BABY INTO COOL WEEKS. WE HAVE A HOSPITAL LINED UP. WE ARE DOING GREAT. I WAS SAYING THAT IT WOULD BE SO GREAT IF SHE IS GOING TO HAVE HER BABY AND I A LOT. STAND UP, HONEY, SAY HELLO.  MR. TRUMP: I WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. I WANT THAT TO HAPPEN SO BADLY. AND MY BOY ERIC WHO HAS BEEN FANTASTIC IN MY STAFF WHO HAS BEEN GREAT AND AGAIN, THANK YOU, SIR, FOR THAT $1 MILLION. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, YOU ARE A SPECIAL GUY, AND WE LOVE IT. THIS IS BEEN A WONDERFUL AND TO AN AMAZING EVENING AND YOU VETERANS ARE AMAZING PEOPLE. YOU ARE BRAVE BEYOND COMPREHENSION. ON BEHALF OF EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE JOB THAT YOU DO, BECAUSE WITHOUT YOU, WE WOULD NOT BE HERE TONIGHT. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. FANTASTIC PEOPLE. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.        >> ","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Rally in Des Moines, Iowa"

THIS IS A MAN ME TALK ABOUT VOTER -- BORDERS, WHO BELIEVES IN BORDERS AND GETTING HIS ENDORSEMENT MEANS A LOT TO ME. HE HAS WANTED TO DO THIS FOR QUITE SOME TIME. WE WERE LOOKING AT THE WORLD AND SEEN A LOT OF BAD THINGS HAPPENING, AND HE IS THE KIND OF GUY WE WANT ON OUR TEAM. HE IS TOUGH, STRONG, SMART AND HE HAS DONE AN AMAZING JOB. HE HAS A GREAT FOLLOWING OF PEOPLE WHO ABSOLUTELY LOVE HIM. JOE, I WOULD LIKE TO REALLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. QUESTIONS.  NO DEALS. SARAH PALIN NEVER ASKED ME FOR ANYTHING. WE GOT A TREMENDOUS ENDORSEMENT FROM LIBERTY UNIVERSITY. HE IS A TERRIFIC MAN, RESPECTED BY EVERYBODY. I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHAT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL ABOUT IT, NO DEALS. JOE DID NOT SAY THAT, SARAH DID NOT SAY THAT. WE DO NOT MAKE DEALS, NOT WHAT FOX, NOT WITH ANYBODY. WE DO NOT MAKE DEALS. THE COUNTRY NEEDS SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING, BECAUSE WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT DOES NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE IRAN DEAL, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BOWE BERGDAHL DEAL, WE ARE ADDRESSED. WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING AS A COUNTRY AND IT IS A PROBLEM.  THAT IS OK. THAT IS THEIR OPINION. I AM PRO-LIFE. ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THIS, I AM PRO-LIFE. I HAVE BEEN PRO-LIFE FOR A LONG TIME. WHAT DID I SAY? YOU DID NOT READ IT. READ THE FULL STATEMENT OF WHAT I SAID. READ THE FULL STATEMENT. NO, YOU ARE NOT READING THE FULL STATEMENT. GET IT OUT AND READ IT. I REMEMBER THIS VERY WELL. HE WAS A FRIEND OF MINE. READ THE FULL STATEMENT. LOOK, THEY HAVE THEIR CHOICE. THEY WILL DO WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO. I AM PRO-LIFE, THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO.  I QUESTION TED CRUZ. I DO NOT EVEN THINK, BASED ON THINGS I HAVE LEARNED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, MANY LAWYERS ARE COMING UP SAYING HE DOES NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO RUN. HE CANNOT RUN BECAUSE HE WAS BORN IN CANADA. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT HE WAS BORN ON CANADIAN SOIL, HE CANNOT RUN FOR PRESIDENT. THE FIRST THING THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IF HE GOT THE NOMINATION, WHICH I DO NOT THINK WILL HAPPEN, BUT IF HE EVER DID, THE FIRST THING THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IF THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO SUE BECAUSE THERE IS A VERY REAL QUESTION AS TO WHETHER HE IS ABLE TO RUN OR ENTITLED TO RUN. AS YOU KNOW, IT IS NOT A SETTLED MATTER WHICH IS A BIG PROBLEM. OTHER PEOPLE HAVE COME BACK AND SAID THIS IS A SETTLED MATTER AND HE DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO RUN. I THINK I AM CONVINCING THEM. EVERY POLL SAYS I AM AHEAD. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I HAVE BONDED WITH THE PEOPLE OF IOWA. I HAVE BONDED. THE EVANGELICALS, WHEN I GET THE ENDORSEMENT FROM THE PHENOMENAL MAN FROM LIBERTY UNIVERSITY, WHEN JERRY CALLED UP, I WAS SO HAPPY TO GET THE ENDORSEMENT. I HAVE REALLY BONDED WITH THE EVANGELICALS, TEA PARTY AND THE PEOPLE OF IOWA. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WHO IS THAT?   I DO NOT THINK -- I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT ME.  I DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW. I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS MY VIEWS. FOX NEWS IS PLAYING GAMES. THERE ARE GOING TO MAKE A FORTUNE. I TOLD FOX THEY SHOULD GIVE MONEY TO THE WOUNDED VOYEURS. I DO NOT THINK MEGYN KELLY IS GOOD AT WHAT SHE DOES. I THINK THEY CAN DO A LOT BETTER THAN MEGYN KELLY. I PROBABLY WON'T BOTHER DOING THE TODAY. I SEE THEY HAVE PICKED ME AS NUMBER ONE, NOT ONLY NUMBER ONE, BUT NUMBER ONE BY FAR. I WILL HAVE SOMETHING ELSE AND I LOOK WHERE WE WILL RAISE MONEY FOR VETERANS AND THE WOUNDED VOYEURS. WE WILL DO SOMETHING SIMULTANEOUSLY DURING THE DEBATE. I DID NOT LIKE THE FACT THAT THEY SENT OUT PRESS RELEASES TALKING ABOUT PUTIN AND PLAYING GAMES. I DO NOT WANT GAMES BEING PLAYED. WHEN THEY SENT OF THAT PRESS RELEASE, AND I THOUGHT THESE PEOPLE WERE PLAYING GAMES. MOST LIKELY, I WILL NOT BE DOING THE DEBATE. THE POINT IS THAT WITH ME, YOU ARE DEALING WITH SOMEONE THAT IS DIFFERENT. THEY CANNOT TOY WITH ME LIKE THEY DO EVERYONE ELSE. LET THEM HAVE THEIR DEBATE AND LET'S SEE HOW THEY DO WITH THE RATINGS. I TOLD HIM, GIVE MONEY TO THE WOUNDED VOYEURS, THE VETERANS BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE A FORTUNE. NOW LET'S SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE WATCH. WE WILL HAVE OUR OWN EVENT TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE WOUNDED VOYEURS AND VETERANS. WHEN THEY SENT OUT THE PRESS REASON -- PRESS RELEASE A LITTLE WHILE AGO, DONE BY SOME KEY OUR PERSON ALONG WITH ROGER AILES, I SAID GOODBYE, OK? EXCUSE ME, JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND. I HAVE DONE SIX DEBATES. ACCORDING TO EVERY SINGLE POLL, I HAVE ONE EVERY SINGLE DEBATE. I PROBABLY WON THE LAST ONE MORE THAN ANY OF THEM. EVERY SINGLE POLL HAS ME WINNING EVERY SINGLE DEBATE. HOW MANY DEBATES DO YOU HAVE TO DO? THE DEMOCRATS ARE FINISHED WITH THE DEBATES. THE REPUBLICANS GO ON FOR EVER AND EVER AND EVER WITH DEBATES. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE 0%, 1% AND NOTHING. IT IS TIME THAT SOMEBODY PLAYS GROWN-UP. I SEE A PRESS RELEASE WRITTEN BY A CHILD, WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO? WHY DO I HAVE TO MAKE FOX RICH? WHY NOT MAKE THE WOUNDED VOYEURS RICH? THIS IS PRETTY CLOSE TO YOUR REVOCABLE. I THINK I WILL DO GREAT IN IOWA. I LOVE I WILL. I DID -- I DO NOT THINK IOWA WILL CARE. THIS COUNTRY NEEDS IS A DEALMAKER. WE NEED SOMEONE THAT WILL MAKE GREAT DEALS WITH RUSSIA, CHINA AND JAPAN. WHAT DO WE GET? WE HAVE DEFICITS WITH THESE COUNTRIES. WE NEED PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. WE DO NOT NEED BABIES. THEY ARE NOT DEALING WITH A BABY. WE WILL SEE. I THINK THE OPPONENTS ARE WONDERFUL PEOPLE. I KNOW A LOT OF THEM. LET'S SEE HOW THEY DO IN THE DEBATE. LET'S SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE WATCH. LET'S SEE HIM MANY PEOPLE WATCH. I SAY GIVE MONEY TO THE WOUNDED VOYEURS. GIVE MONEY TO THE VETERANS -- WOUNDED WARRIORS. GIVE MONEY TO THE VETERANS. MEGYN KELLY IS A LIGHTWEIGHT AND SHE SHOULD THAT BE IN THE DEBATE. WHEN MEGYN KELLY DID NOT ASK ME A QUESTION, I THOUGHT IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE. EVERYONE SAID I WON THE DEBATE. EVERYONE SAID I WON ALL OF THE DEBATES. WE HAVE HAD SIX DEBATES NOW, WHY SHOULD THE NETWORKS CONTINUE TO GET RICH ON THESE DEBATES? GIVE SOME TO THE WOUNDED VOYEURS. LET'S SEE -- WOUNDED WARRIORS. LET'S SEE HOW MUCH MONEY FOX WILL MAKE.   HE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS PERSON IN TERMS OF DEPORTATION, BUT IN TERMS OF STOPPING AND CREATING A NEW BORDER. I HAVE THE TOUGHEST PLAN IN TERMS OF BORDER. I AM BUILDING THE WALL AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING WE WANT TO BUILD A WALL. WHERE HAD THEY BEEN? WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BUILDING A WALL, BUILDING A STRONG BORDER. SHERIFF JOE UNDERSTANDS THAT BETTER THAN ANYBODY BECAUSE HE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB AND HAS BEEN GIVEN VERY LITTLE RESOURCES. I THINK THE REPRESENTATION OF HAVING SHERIFF JOE ON MY SIDE IT WAS REALLY GREAT, SOMETHING I APPRECIATED.  WE HAVE OTHER PEOPLE. I FEEL WE HAVE TO STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. WHEN I ANNOUNCED I WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, I DID THIS ON JUNE 16, I BROUGHT UP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. THIS WOULD NOT EVEN BE TALKED ABOUT IF I DID NOT BRING IT UP. RIGHT NOW, IT IS THE BIGGEST SUBJECT AND IT CARRIES OVER TO ISIS AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING WITH MIGRATION IN SYRIA AND PEOPLE COMING IN WHO WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE. THEY COULD BE ISIS, WE DO NOT KNOW IT IT HAS TO STOP. WE ARE $19 TRILLION AS A COUNTRY AND WE HAVE PEOPLE RUNNING OUR COUNTRY THAT ARE INCOMPETENT. THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. YOU HAVE TO CREATE A STRONG BORDER. WE NEED SECURITY FOR OUR COUNTRY. CANNOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.  -- TIME DATA? DONALD TRUMP: I WOULD START RIGHT AWAY. WE HAVE GANGS IN LOS ANGELES AND A DIFFERENT PLACES THAT ARE MADE UP OF 100% ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. THEY WOULD BE GONE SO FAST. THE LOCAL POLICE KNOW ALL ABOUT IT. THEY WOULD BE GONE SO FAST. SAY IT AGAIN.  MY WHOLE LIFE, I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH POLITICIANS. POLITICIANS ARE FINE, BUT NOW IT IS TIME TO DO IT A LOT BETTER BECAUSE THESE POLITICIANS HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE ALL TALK AND NO ACTION. ALL THEY DO CARE ABOUT -- ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS GETTING REELECTED. WE NEED TO BRING OUR COUNTRY BACK. WE ARE LOSING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR WITH TRADE IN CHINA. WE ARE LOSING MONEY IN TRADE WITH JAPAN. WE DO SO MUCH FOR EVERYBODY ELSE. YOU LOOK AT SOUTH KOREA. I HAVE FRIENDS, DEALS AND BUILDINGS IN SOUTH KOREA. WE HAVE 28,000 SOLDIERS ON THE LINE. WHAT DO WE GET OUT OF ALL OF THIS? I WOULD SPEAK TO CONGRESS.  WHERE WOULD YOU GET FUNDING? DONALD TRUMP: WE ARE LOSING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. WE ARE LOSING SO MUCH MONEY THE COUSIN OF THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. PEOPLE DO NOT REALIZE THAT. FIRST OF ALL, MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL. THE REASON THEY ARE GOING TO PAY, A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK LIKE THE POLITICIANS, YOU CANNOT GET MEXICO, BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN. THEY ARE MAKING A FORTUNE OFF OF THE UNITED STATES. THEY ARE GOING TO PAY FOR PLENTY. I HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEXICO. I HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE MEXICAN PEOPLE. I HAVE THOUSANDS OF HISPANICS, AND YOU HAVE SEEN SOME RECENT POLLS IN NEVADA WHERE I AM LEADING WITH HISPANICS. THEY WANT JOBS. I AM GOING TO BRING JOBS BACK FROM CHINA, JAPAN, MEXICO. WE ARE GOING TO BRING JOBS BACK FROM OUR COUNTRY. OUR COUNTRY IS STARVING FOR JOBS. WE ARE LOSING THE BASE AND MANUFACTURING. CHINA IS DEVALUING ITS CURRENCY, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR COMPANIES TO COMPETE. NOW JAPAN IS DOING THE SAME THING. JAPAN IS KILLING US WITH THE YEN. THEY ARE DEVALUE IN THE CURRENCY. IT IS BRUTAL. TAKE A LOOK AT CATERPILLAR. THEY ARE GETTING KILLED BECAUSE POLITICIANS DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. TYCO IS MOVING TO IRELAND. THEY ARE LEAVING THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE MAJOR CORPORATIONS LEAVING THE COUNTRY BECAUSE POLITICIANS DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING.  THEY HAVE TO GO. 50% ARE STOPPED AT THE BORDER. OVERSTAY IS EASY TO TAKE CARE OF. IT IS CALLED MANAGEMENT. THEY FLY ON, COMMON, STAY FOREVER. THAT CANNOT HAPPEN. WE HAVE A SLOGAN, MAKE AMERICA GREAT. THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.  EXACTLY, WHY DID YOU NOT READ THAT BEFORE. EXCUSE ME. YOU DID NOT READ THE QUESTION. WHEN YOU COURTED -- WHEN YOU QUOTED, YOU DID NOT READ WHAT YOU JUST READ. READ IT AGAIN. WHY DID YOU NOT SAY WHEN YOU ASKED THE QUESTION BEFORE, THAT I HATE THE CONCEPT OF ABORTION? NO. YOU WERE QUOTING HIM. WHY DID YOU NOT READ MY QUOTE THE WAY I SAID IT? DO NOT ASK ME QUESTIONS LIKE THAT. YOU ARE NOT A VERY GOOD REPORTER. THAT IS A CHEAP SHOT. YOU HAVE A GUY LIKE TED CRUZ WHO IS NERVOUS AS CAN BE. HE IS A NERVOUS WRECK. I PICKED UP 12 POINTS IN IOWA ON HIM THE OTHER DAY OVER IT. A TIME OF LESS THAN A WEEK. I UNDERSTAND HIM. I ALWAYS GET ALONG WITH THEM BUT I HAVE BEEN WAITING, AND FINALLY AT THE LAST DEBATE, HE STARTED KNOCKING THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK AND VALUES. I THOUGHT IT WAS A DISGRACE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS A DISGRACE. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT AMOUNT OF TIME, NOTHING IS GOING TO BE EASY, THAT HE IS A WRECK. HE DOES NOT KNOW HIMSELF WHETHER HE HAS THE LEGAL RIGHT TO RUN AND SERVE AS PRESIDENT. HOW CAN YOU VOTE FOR SOMEONE WHEN YOU KNOW THE DEMOCRATS WILL BRING THE SUIT? THIS IS A CLOUD ON TITLE. NO ONE KNOWS IF HE CAN RUN FOR OFFICE. I TEND TO DOUBT IT. SOME GREAT CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYERS SAY HE DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEARCH. HE CANNOT SERVE AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THAT IS A PROBLEM. I DID NOT LIKE THE FACT THAT ON HIS FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORM, WHICH IS A BIG PROBLEM, HE IS GOING TO BE ROBIN HOOD, PROTECT EVERYBODY. HE FORGOT TO MENTION A COUPLE OF LITTLE FACTS, THE BANKS. HE DID NOT PUT THEM IN. WHY DID HE NOT PUT GOLDMAN SACHS AND? HE DID NOT PUT THEM IN. HE SAID HE FORGOT. HE ALSO SAID HE DID NOT KNOW HE WAS A CANADIAN CITIZEN 15 MONTHS AGO. HE SAID, OH, I DID NOT KNOW I WAS. HE WAS BORN IN CANADA. HE WAS A CANADIAN CITIZEN, AND 15 MONTHS AGO HE RENOUNCED HIS CITIZENSHIP. HE WAS THE FIRST CANADIAN CITIZEN TO EVER BE A SENATOR IN THIS COUNTRY, A SENATOR FROM TEXAS. HE WAS A CANADIAN CITIZEN. HE DID NOT KNOW HE WAS A CANADIAN CITIZEN?  I THINK MY TEMPERAMENT IS GREAT. I BUILT A GREAT CORPORATION AND COMPANY, BUT WHEN FOX SENDS OUT A PRESS RELEASE ABOUT PUTIN, I SAY LET THEM HAVE THE DEBATE AND I WILL RAISE MONEY FOR VETERANS, AND LET FOX PLAY ITS GAMES. I LOVE THE DEBATES. I LOVE DEBATING. I DID NOT KNOW IT. I NEVER DEBATED BEFORE. I AM A BUILDER WHO CREATED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS OVER THE YEARS. I DID NOT KNOW I ENJOY DEBATING, BUT I ENJOYED THE FIRST ONE, EVEN THOUGH I THOUGHT MEGYN KELLY WAS A BAD MODERATOR. SHE IS A TOTAL LIGHTWEIGHT. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I DID NOT KNOW I WAS GOING TO ENJOY THE DEBATE PROCESS. I ACTUALLY LOVE IT. IF YOU CHECK ALL OF THE ONLINE POLLS THAT JUDGE DEBATES, ALMOST EVERY SINGLE POLL SAID I WON EVERY SIGNAL DEBATE. THAT IS NOT BAD.  I THINK YOU CAN SAY THAT. IT SOUNDS LIKE I AM OUT, DOESN'T IT? I HAVE NEVER THREATENED TO QUIT. I SAID WITH CNN, I THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE MONEY TO THE VETERANS. I THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE MONEY TO THE VETERANS. DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION THAT IS LEGITIMATE? DO YOU APOLOGIZE?  DO YOU APOLOGIZE FOR NOT READING MY WORDS? EXCUSE ME, DO YOU APOLOGIZE FOR NOT READING MY EXACT WORDS? I DID NOT ASK THAT. EXCUSE ME. YOU QUOTED ME AND YOU TOOK OUT THE MAIN PART OF THE QUOTE. DO YOU APOLOGIZE? OK, FORGET YOU. GO AHEAD, SARAH.   THIS IS NOT A CHEAP SHOT. I HAVE HAD A VERY GOOD LIFE AND HAVE BEEN A GOOD PERSON ALL MY LIFE. I AM A RELIGIOUS PERSON WHO GIVES MONEY TO CHARITY. I FEEL YOU CAN BRING UP WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO. GO AHEAD. I WILL GIVE YOU AN ANSWER TO THAT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE.  WHAT CAN I TELL YOU? I THINK MOST PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY AGREE WITH ME HAVING TO DO WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, WHEN WE COMES TO -- WHEN IT COMES TO RADICAL ISLAM. WHEN THE PRESIDENT REFUSES TO USE THE TERM RADICAL ISLAM, WHY, YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK HIM. YOU CANNOT SOLVE A PROBLEM UNTIL YOU ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM. YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK HIM. SAY IT LOUD BECAUSE OF IT LIKE EVERYONE TO HEAR THIS.  IT IS BECAUSE HE IS A NASTY PERSON. PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE HIM. THE SENATORS AND PEOPLE HE WORKS WITH DO NOT LIKE HIM. I AM A LITTLE BIT OF A REBEL, BUT YOU HAVE TO GET ALONG WITH PEOPLE. WE HAVE TO REBUILD OUR COUNTRY AGAIN. $19 TRILLION IN DEBT, TREMENDOUS DEFICITS, AND THE REAL NUMBER IN JOBS IS NOT 5.2%. WHEN SOMEONE GETS UP LOOKING FOR A JOB, IT IS STATISTICALLY TAKEN OFF THE ROLLS. WE HAVE TO BUILD UP OUR COUNTRY. TO DO THAT, YOU HAVE TO GET ALONG. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SEMBLANCE OF SOMETHING. PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE TED CRUZ. THEY DO NOT LIKE HIM. THE EVANGELICALS LIKE ME BETTER THAN TED CRUZ. THEY UNDERSTAND I AM A CHRISTIAN, A GOOD CHRISTIAN IN THE EVANGELICALS HAVE FOUND THAT OUT. HOW ABOUT ONE MORE? I JUST WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. I HAVE HAD A GREAT LIFE. I HAVE EMPLOYED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, THAT MEANS EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE. I BUILT AN UNBELIEVABLE COMPANY. WHEN I FILED, ALL OF YOU PEOPLE RAN DOWN BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO SEE IF I WAS NOT AS BIG AS YOU EXPECTED, BUT I HAVE ONE OF THE BIGGEST ASSETS IN THE WORLD. I HAVE VERY LITTLE DEBT. I SAY THAT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS. OUR COUNTRY NEEDS THAT KIND OF THINKING. WE HAVE $19 TRILLION WORTH OF DEBT WITH A HORRIBLE DEAL THAT IS ADDING ANOTHER $2 TRILLION. WE ARE SPENDING MONEY LIKE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE A CLUE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE HAVE LEADERSHIP THAT IS INCOMPETENT. WHEN I HEAR KERRY SAYING THE OTHER DAY, SOME OF THE $19 BILLION -- $1920 IS GOING TO BE SPENT FOR TERROR, IT IS INTERESTING. SUPPOSEDLY I SAID TODAY, SPENDING ALL OF THIS MONEY IN EUROPE, I RAN, THERE WERE 100 AND 14 -- 114 JETS MADE IN EUROPE. WHERE IS BOEING? WHEN I LOOK AT THE STUPIDITY OF OUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY, I SAY, I HAVE NO CHOICE. I LOVE MY LIFE AND I HAVE ENJOYED MY LIFE. I HAVE A GREAT FAMILY IN A GREAT COMPANY BUT I HAVE TO DO THIS. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.  ","Donald Trump News Conference in Marshalltown, Iowa"

MR. TRUMP: WHAT A DAY. I JUST GOT BACK FROM CHURCH PER AT I LEARNED SOMETHING. WE TALKED ABOUT HUMILITY IN CHURCH TODAY. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS AIMED AT ME. PERHAPS.  THE CHURCH I DON'T THINK A NEW I WAS COMING. IT MAY HAVE BEEN BY LUCK. THIS IS CRUNCH TIME. WE ARE JUST ABOUT A WEEK, A LITTLE BIT MORE. I JUST HOPE YOU GET OUT THERE AND DO YOUR THING. IF WE DO IT, WE WILL HAVE AN UNBELIEVABLE VICTORY. LOOK AT ALL OF THESE BEAUTIFUL HATS. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. LOOK AT THAT. WE ARE GOING TO DO A GREAT JOB. WHEN I WENT ON TO THIS JOURNEY, JUNE 16, DOWN THE ESCALATOR. I WILL TELL YOU THAT TAKES GUTS. IT TOOK GUTS AND CERTAIN COURAGE. IT IS NOT SOMETHING I HAVE EVER DONE. POLITICIANS RUN FOR OFFICE, THEY WIN AND LOSE, THEY WIN AND LOSE. THEY DON'T CARE. THEY ARE ALL TALK, NO ACTION. I HAVE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE. THE RECEPTION HAS AN INCREDIBLE. THE POLLS HAVE AN AMAZING. JUST LIKE THIS ROOM AND EVERY ROOM IS PACKED NO MATTER WHERE WE GO. MUCH BIGGER THAN BERNIE SANDERS. WE ARE SECOND. WE HAVE THE BIGGEST CROWD.  THE PRESS NEVER TALKS ABOUT MY CROWDS. BUT WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE HAS A CROWD -- LAST WEEK, WE HAD 12,000 PEOPLE. BERNIE SANDERS HAD 3000. THAT IS GOOD. AND HE IS SECOND, WAY DOWN THE LOAN BUT SEC -- DOWN THE LINE, BUT SECOND. 20,000 PEOPLE AND BERNIE SANDERS HAS 3000 AND WE HAVE 12,000. THEY SAID BERNIE SANDERS HAD 3000 PEOPLE. IT WAS GREAT. THEN THEY TALK ABOUT TRUMP, I HAD 12000 AND WE HAD TO SEND 5000 HOME BECAUSE WE DID NOT GET THEM IN.  BUT THEY DID NOT MENTION THAT. THEY DON'T MENTION IT. THE CAMERAS ARE ALWAYS ON MY FACE. THEY NEVER WANT TO SHOW THE CROWD. THE PEOPLE GET IT. THE PEOPLE ARE REALLY SMART. SOMEONE ASKS ME WHAT YOU MOST LEARNED. I LEARNED A LOT. HELLO, DARLING. LOOK. I LOVE THESE PEOPLE. WE HAVE THE MOST LOYAL PEOPLE. WE HAVE THE MOST LOYAL. THAT IS THE OTHER THING I LEARNED, THE LOYALTY. THEY DO POLLS ON THE DEBATE, WE WHEN ALL OF THE POLLS ON THE DEBATE. ANOTHER DEBATE COMING UP ON THURSDAY AND I THINK THAT WILL BE FINE. I DO NOT KNOW IF IT WILL BE FAIR, BUT WE WILL HANDLE IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. IT IS WHAT WE HAVE GOT TO DO. I LEARNED THE LEVEL OF LOYALTY TO OUR MOVEMENT, IT IS REALLY BEYOND ME. THIS IS A MOVEMENT. IT IS NOT LIKE A NORMAL SITUATION. THE COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE THIS WEEK, A REALLY FAIR STORY, A PROFESSIONAL, BEAUTIFUL STORY ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN. IT HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY. THEY WILL STUDY IT. I GET CALLS ALL THE TIME BY REPORTERS. HOW DOES IT FEEL TO DO WHAT YOU HAVE DONE? I DID NOT DO ANYTHING. ON FEBRUARY 1, WE HAVE GOT TO GO OUT AND YOU HAVE GOT TO DO IT. NO MATTER HOW YOU FEEL, IF YOU ARE FEELING SICK, HAVING FIGHTS WITH YOUR WIFE OR YOUR HUSBAND, NO MATTER WHAT IS GOING ON, IF YOU LOST YOUR JOB 15 MINUTES BEFORE, IF THEY SAID YOU ARE FIRED BECAUSE THE ECONOMY STATES, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, YOU HAVE GOT TO GET OUT BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THINGS. WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE IT.  IT HAS BEEN VERY EXCITING. THE CHAIRMAN TELLS ME SO MANY CALLS HAVE BEEN MADE SO MANY CALLS ARE COMING IN. THEY ARE GOING FROM DEMOCRAT TO REPUBLICAN AND HE SAID HE HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT AND HAS BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. WHETHER IT IS REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT, LIBERAL, CONSERVATIVE, THEY ARE SICK AND TIRED OF SEEING OUR COUNTRY RIPPED OFF BY EVERY SINGLE NATION IN THE WORLD.  THEY ARE SICK AND TIRED OF IT AND WE ARE GOING TO STOP IT. SO YESTERDAY, A COUPLE OF THINGS HAPPENED. DURING THE LAST WEEK, WE HAD A WONDERFUL WOMAN WHO THE -- THE PRESS DOES NOT TREAT FAIRLY. SARAH PALIN CAME OUT AND ENDORSED US. IF YOU KNEW HER PERSONALLY, YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND EVEN MORE. EVERYBODY LIKES SARAH. SHE IS AN AMAZING WOMAN. HER HUSBAND IS FANTASTIC. WE GOT A CALL, WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU AND ENDORSE YOU. HOW NICE IS THAT. HE WAS AT 2%. A CANADIAN CITIZEN. I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS SORT OF INTERESTING. SHE WAS AMAZING. HER LEVEL OF SUCCESS WITH ENDORSEMENTS IS TREMENDOUS. THE PRESS DOES NOT GIVE HER HER JUST DO. SHE IS A WONDERFUL WOMAN WHO LOVES THIS COUNTRY. I WAS HAPPY TO HAVE HER ENDORSEMENT. I WANT TO THANK YOU, SARAH, WHO IS PROBABLY WATCHING. YOU HAVE ALL THOSE CAMERAS ON RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE A LOT OF CAMERAS.  WE HAVE A LOT OF CAMERAS. A COUPLE OF THINGS, INDIVIDUAL CANDIDATES. WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE THING. SHOULD I GO THROUGH A COUPLE OF POLLS? YES? FOX JUST CAME OUT, 12 OR 14 POINTS, TRUMP IS UP, YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT, RIGHT? TRUMP IS UP.  YOU ARE STILL LAGGING BEHIND EVERYBODY, FOLKS BECAUSE THE REST OF THE NATION, WE ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. A POLL YESTERDAY, 48%. ANOTHER 1, 40 2%. 36 AND 38%. WE ARE DOING GREAT. WE ARE DOING UNBELIEVABLY. NUMBERS CAME UP FROM FOX AND CBS THIS MORNING FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE WHERE WE ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. IN SOUTH CAROLINA, ALL OF THEM, NEVADA, ALL OF THEM. I AM HAPPY BECAUSE I SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF IOWA. I THINK WE WILL WIN IOWA. EVEN MY PEOPLE, THEY SAY PLEASE DO NOT SAY YOU WILL WIN BECAUSE IT YOU COME IN SECOND -- I SAY THAT IS OK, I'M GOING TO WIN. WE HAVE NOT HAD A WINNER IN 16 YEARS HERE AND IT IS TIME. IT IS TIME. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT. THANK YOU.  YOU HAVE NOT PICKED A WINNER IN 16 YEARS. IF YOU CHOOSE ME, WE WILL FINALLY HAVE A WINNER. THEY WANT TO MOVE YOU TO THE BACK OF THE PACK. YOU WANT -- YOU KNOW THAT? A BIG PUSH THAT I WILL WILL NOT BE WHERE YOU ARE NOW. THEY WANT TO MOVE YOU AND I GIVE YOU THIS PLEDGE. IF I WIN, THEY ARE NEVER MOVING YOU. YOU ARE STAYING THERE. YOU ARE STAYING THERE, 100%. YOU ARE STAYING WHERE YOU ARE. HONESTLY, REGARDLESS, A GREAT TRADITION HERE. IT IS AN AMAZING THING. AN AMAZING PLACE, A GREAT LACE. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO WIN. I AM NOT GOING TO SAY I WILL BE THRILLED WHEN I COME IN SECOND. I DON'T THINK WE WILL. IM LOOKING AT WHAT IS HAPPENING. THERE IS A THEORY, THAT I WILL ACTUALLY DO BETTER THAN ALL THE POLLS. THE POLLS WITH TRUMP, THEY WERE SAYING THIS MORNING, NOT EVEN A FAN, BUT HE SAID, TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN THE WHOLE THING. TRUMP IS GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE AND HE WILL PROBABLY DO WELL AGAINST HILLARY BECAUSE LOOK WHAT HE DID LAST WEEK AGAINST HILLARY. I WAS THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO BERNIE SANDERS. MY ATTACK ON HILLARY, SHE WENT DOWN AND SANDERS GOT ALL THE CREDIT FOR IT.  THIS GUY, BERNIE SANDERS, GIVE ME A BREAK. BUT HE GOT ALL THE CREDIT. IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. I ASSUME THE PRESS IS LISTENING TODAY. SHE SAID FALSE THINGS ABOUT ME SO I HIT HER HARD. ON THE FOX POLL AND ANOTHER POLL THAT CAME OUT THAT I AM BEATING HILLARY, AND I WILL BEAT HILLARY, --   WE HAVE NOT EVEN FOCUS ON HILLARY OR BERNIE SANDERS YET. HE IS, THEY SAY SOCIALIST, BUT SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY HE IS A COMMUNIST ERA AND I SHOULD NOT HIT HIM TOO HARD. IF I HIT HIM HARD, HE WILL GO DOWN AND THEN WE WILL FIGHT WITH HILLARY. ISN'T HE A WONDERFUL GUY? I DO NOT WANT TO HIT HIM TOO HARD. I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT. WHEN I HIT HILLARY LAST WEEK, AND BILL, ALL THE SUDDEN THEY DID THIS AND THEN THEY START SAYING BERNIE SANDERS IS SURGING, AN AMAZING HAPPENED. I'M SAYING I DID THAT. NOW MAYBE -- I COULD HIT HIM. I HAVE STUFF IN MY MIND. I COULD HIT HIM SO HARD, HE WOULD DROP.  P IS TOO EASY. HE IS REALLY TOO EASY. LOOK AT THESE CANDIDATES WE ARE AGAINST. WE HAVE JEB.  WE HAVE JEB, EXCALAMATION POINT. HE IS SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITH NEGATIVE ADS. HERE'S A GUY WHO SPENT CLOSE TO $100 MILLION. THE POLLS COMING OUT THIS MORNING, HE WENT DOWN. HE IS DOWN AT THE BOTTOM. IT IS TIME TO GIVE UP. IT IS TIME TO GIVE UP. IN LIFE, SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO ADMIT WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE IT. HE DOES NOT HAVE IT. HE DOES NOT HAVE IT. HE TAKES VICIOUS ADVERTISEMENTS, ""HE IS NOT A TRUE CONSERVATIVE."" WHAT DOES THIS GUY KNOW ABOUT ME? HE SAYS, ""HE WILL NOT WIN THE RACE."" IF HE IS SO GOOD, HOW COME I AM BEATING HIM? UNBELIEVABLE. HE IS AT 3M I MET 42 -- THREE AND I AM AT 42. HERE IS A GUY WHO SPENT ALMOST $100 MILLION. I SPENT ALMOST NOTHING. I FEEL GUILTY. IT IS NOW UP TO ALMOST 40 MILLION. I HAD A BUDGET TO HAVE SPENT $40 MILLION. I'M SPENDING MY OWN MONEY AND NOT OTHER PEOPLE'S. I AM THE ONLY ONE.  I AM THE ONLY ONE DOING THAT. EVERYBODY ELSE, HILLARY, AND EVERY SINGLE CANDIDATE, EVERY SINGLE CANDIDATE, IS DOING WHAT THEY ARE DOING. YOU HAVE CRUZ GETTING OIL MONEY -- HE IS SO AGAINST ETHANOL, YOU CAN FORGET IT. ALL THOSE WONDERFUL FARMERS THAT PRODUCE WHAT THEY HAVE TO PRODUCE, CRUZ IS T5OTAOTALLY AGAINST -- THEN HE CHANGED. HE IS NOT SO PRINCIPLED BECAUSE HE CHANGED AND THEN CHANGED AGAIN AND GOT A LITTLE BIT MORE. WHAT IS THAT AGAINST -- ABOUT PRINCIPLED? GETTING KILLED, AND THAT HE CHANGED, HE CHANGED TWICE VERY AND HE WILL CHANGE BACK SO FAST BECAUSE WHO IS GIVING HIM MONEY? OIL PEOPLE ARE GIVING HIM MONEY. NOBODY IS GIVING ME MONEY. I TURNED DOWN MONEY. I FEEL SO FULL ITCH -- SO FOOLISH. MY WHOLE LIFE, I TAKE AND TAKE. GREEDY. NOW I WILL BE GREEDY FOR THE UNITED STATES AND I WILL TAKE FOR THE UNITED STATES. I AM GOING TO BE SO GREEDY --   WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY MORE OF THESE DEALS WITH IRAN WHERE WE GIVE THEM $150 BILLION, 100 AND $50 BILLION. WE SHOULD OF NEVER GIVEN IT AND WE SHOULD HAVE HAD OUR PRISONERS BACK EARS AGO BEFORE THE NEGOTIATIONS STARTED. YOU DO NOT START THE NEGOTIATION UNLESS THEY GIVE US ACT OUR PRISONERS. YOU DO NOT STARTED HERE YOU DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. I TELL THE STORY ALL THE TIME BECAUSE IT IS AMAZING. YOU GO IN AND THEY HAVE OUR PRISONERS, THREE AND FOUR, AND IT WILL SET A WAVE OF KIDNAPPING LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. PEOPLE SEE THAT DEAL, AND PUTTING THE DEAL TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER, IT WILL SET A WAVE. YOU WALK IN AND THEY WILL SAY LET'S START. WE HAVE TO HAVE THE PRISONERS BACK. THEY WILL SAY NO. WE WILL SAY, CAN I HAVE THE PRISONERS BACK AND THEY WILL SAY NO. YOU WALK OUT. YOU DOUBLE UP THE SANCTIONS. THEY WILL CALL YOU WITHIN 48 HOURS, THERE PEOPLE OUTSIDE STILL TRYING TO GET -- THEY WILL CALL YOU AT SURE AS YOU ARE STANDING HERE, AND THEY WILL SAY, YOU HAVE GOT YOUR PRISONERS. NOW YOU GET YOUR PRISONERS. YOU GO IN AND SAY, THERE IS ANOTHER ITEM. WE CANNOT GIVE YOU BACK $150 BILLION TO WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THEY ARE A GOOD NEGOTIATOR P OR WE HAVE GUYS WHO ARE BETTER. WE WANT TO GET THE PRISONERS BACK. THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE. WE DID NOT MAKE ANY DEALS. SAY NOW, $150 BILLION, WE ARE BLESSED. WE HAVE GOT $19 TRILLION IN DEBT. MY FATHER USED TO SAY, TAKE THE LUMP SUM. WE HAVE GOT $150 BILLION. WE DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY. WE OWN $19 TRILLION NOW WITH THE STUPID BUDGET DEAL. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT DEAL? WE ARE NOW AT $21 TRILLION, $21 TRILLION. TRILLION. TRILLION DOLLARS. SO WE SAY WE CANNOT DO IT, WE HAVE 19 TRILLION, AND THEY WILL BE ANGRY, AND WHAT YOU DO IS LEAVE THE ROOM AND THAT IS THE END OF THATY AND THEY CALL YOU BACK. WHAT THEY MADE AND THAT DEAL, 20 FOUR HOUR INSPECTION, WHAT THEY DID IS SO INCREDIBLE. WE COULD HAVE HAD A GREAT DEAL. I LIKE THE IDEA OF DEALS. DEALS ARE GOOD. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH TED CRUZ, EVERYBODY HATES HIM. SUCH A NASTY GUY. THINK OF IT. NOT ONE UNITED STATES SENATOR HAS ENDORSED HIM. AND THE SENATOR WAS WITH ME AND INTRODUCED US, WHAT A WONDERFUL GUY HE IS, SENATOR GRASSLEY, A GREAT GUY. BUT THINK OF IT. THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN YOU DEAL OF PEOPLE ON A DAILY BASIS AND NOT ONE PERSON ENDORSES YOU. THERE IS SOMETHING MISSING THERE, SOMETHING THAT. HE HIT ME FIRST DURING THE DEBATE. THE MATTER WHAT I DID, I COULD HAVE DONE ANY IN, HE WAS BACKING ME UP. I SAID THIS GUY SEEMS LIKE A NICE GUY, MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE THERE IT CARSON BACKED ME UP NICELY AND HE WAS A GOOD GUY PERSONALLY. HONESTLY, I LIKE A NUMBER OF THEM RUNNING. BUT WITH CRUZ, HE WAS SO POSITIVE. EVERYTHING WAS GREAT. I DID THE MUSLIM, GREAT. SOMEBODY HAS TO DO IT. SOMEBODY HAS TO SAY WHAT IS GOING ON. WE HAVE RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR GOING ON ALL OVER THE WORLD AND WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL NOT SAY IT. HE WILL NOT EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. SO I DID THAT AND HE WAS FINE WITH THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT AND NOW THEY ARE. THEY SAY TRUMP HAS A POINT. I THINK SO, I HAVE A POINT. WHEN PLANES FLY INTO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER AND THE PENTAGON AND WHEREVER THE THIRD PLANE WAS GOING --     GOODBYE. GOODBYE. GOODBYE.     P WAS NOT WEARING ONE OF THOSE HATS. AND HE NEVER WILL. AND HE NEVER WILL BUT THAT IS OK. WE HAVE GOT TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORKING. I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE MUSLIMS AND THEY CALL ME UP. NOT ALL OF THEM, BUT SOME OF THEM. WE HAVE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT IS GOING ON. THESE TWO YOUNG'S PEOPLE -- YOUNG PEOPLE THAT GOT MARRIED, THEY GOT RADICALIZED, AND GAVE THEM PARTIES, YOU KILL THEM AND THEN IN PARIS, YOU LOSE 100 30 PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE GUNS. WE WILL PROTECT THE SECOND AMENDMENT IF I AM PRESIDENT.  THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE WORLD IN PARIS, WHO KNOWS. IN FRANCE, THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE WORLD AS A COUNTRY, YOU CANNOT HAVE A GUN, AND YET THE BAD GUYS CAN ALWAYS HAVE A GUN. YOU WITH THE WHITE HAT. IF I PICK OUT YOU, YOU RIGHT THERE WITH A SIGN, IF I PICK OUT YOU, IF I PICK OUT A FEW PEOPLE OUT OF THE AUDIENCE, THEY COULD PICK OUT ALMOST ANYBODY. IF YOU HAD A GUN IN THE BULLETS WERE FIRING THE OTHER WAY IN PARIS OR CALIFORNIA OR REMEMBER THE FIVE MILITARY OFFICERS THAT WERE KILLED IN A GUN FREE ZONE ON A MILITARY BASE, THAT WILL END THE FIRST DAY. NO MORE. NO MORE.  IF THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE IN THERE WITH GUNS, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HAD 130 PEOPLE KILLED. AND THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LOOKING WITH THE GUY WITH THE DIRTY HAT. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR HIM FOR LONG. THE OTHER THING, THE PRESS. THEY ARE A DISHONEST GROUP OF PEOPLE. THE GUY WITH A DIRTY HAT, THEY CALLED HIM THE MASTERMIND. FOR TWO DAYS, THEY ARE LOOKING FOR HIM AND CALLING HIM THE MASTERMIND. HE SENT PEOPLE INTO A COUPLE OF PLACES IN PARIS AND SAID SHOOT EVERYBODY THAT YOU CAN. WHAT IS GOING ON. THEY SAID, "" WHO THE HELL HE IS. AND I CALLED HIM THE GUY WITH THE DIRTY HAT. PROBABLY A LOW IQ. HE IS A FREAKING MORONS. . THE PRESS IS CALLING HIM THE MASTERMIND AND AND THEY ARE WONDERING WHY THE YOUTH IS THE RADICALIZED. THEY ARE USING THE INTERNET BETTER THAN WE USE IT AND OUR GUYS INVENTED IT. THEY ARE HEARING, HE IS A MASTERMIND, HE IS A MASTERMIND. HE IS A DIRTY, ROTTEN MORE ON. AND WE KILLED HIM, FORTUNATELY. THE COPS IN FRANCE DID A GREAT JOB AND THE COPS IN CALIFORNIA DID AN AMAZING JOB. OUR POLICE, I TELL YOU WHAT, THE MOST MISTREATED PEOPLE PRACTICALLY IN THIS COUNTRY. POLICE AND VETERANS. REMEMBER THAT.  I LOOKED AT WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH IN CALIFORNIA WITH ALL THE SHOOTING GOING ON AND ALL THAT STUFF HERE IT -- STUFF. YOU HAVE THAT ONE 100TH OF 1%, WHERE A HORRIBLE THING HAPPENS, IT THAT POLICEMAN, THAT CAN HAPPEN, A HUGE STORY ALL OVER THE WORLD. THEY PLAY IT UP BUT THEY DO NOT TALK ABOUT ALL THE GOOD THINGS. GIVE THEM A HAND. GIVE THEM A HAND.  I HAVE HAD SO MANY ENDORSEMENTS FROM POLICE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. I JUST RESPECT THEM A LOT. THEY ARE AFRAID EVERY TIME THEY TALK TO SOMEBODY. IF THEY ARE A LITTLE ROUGH, THEY END UP LOSING THEIR PENSION AND A JOB. IT IS TERRIBLE WHAT IS GOING ON WITH OUR POLICE. I HAVE HAD POLICEMAN, TOUGH COOKIES, WHERE THEY ARE LITERALLY AFRAID TO BE A LITTLE ROUGH WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY BAD PEOPLE. BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID THEY WILL END UP GETTING BROUGHT BEFORE COMMISSIONS AND LOSE THEIR JOBS. WE HAVE GOT TO SHARES -- CHERISH OUR POLICE OFFICERS. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. VERY IMPORTANT.  I SAY TO MYSELF, REALLY REASON I MENTION BUSH IS BECAUSE YOU GET ANGRY AT IT, BUT HERE IS THE STORY. IF WE COULD DO WHAT WE HAVE DONE, I SPENT PRACTICALLY NOTHING. THE BIGGEST EXPENSE IS MY AIRPLANE P OR I OWN IT. I HAVE TO PAY MYSELF BECAUSE I OWN MY AIRPLANE. SO I HAVE AN EXPENSE. YOU FIND THE MARKET VALUE OF THE PLANE, THE WHOLE THING IS RIDICULOUS. BUT I SPENT VERY LITTLE MONEY. I AM GOING TO FOR TWO REASONS. NUMBER ONE, I FEEL GUILTY. I FEEL GUILTY. NUMBER TWO, I DO NOT WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE. I DO NOT WANT TO BE A WISE GUY, BECAUSE I WILL WIN WITHOUT SPENDING P OR I'M GOING TO SPEND WHATEVER IT TAKES. I DO NOT WANT TO BE A WISE GUY.  BUT ONE LINE I HATE GETTING RID OF, IT IS SO COOL TO SAY YOU HAVE SPENT THE LEAST. I HAVE SPENT LESS THAN ANYBODY, JUST ABOUT. AND YOU ARE BY FAR NUMBER ONE. IT IS SO COOL. IT IS SO COOL. AND I DO NOT REALLY HAVE TO SPEND. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT, YOU DO -- YOU DON'T HAVE TO. IT IS BECAUSE I GET GOOD RATINGS. IT IS VERY SIMPLE. FACE THE NATION IS A VERY GOOD SHOW, JOHN DICKERSON. LAST NIGHT, I HAVE GOT TO BE STRAIGHT. DO YOU THINK IF I WAS WRONG ON THIS, YOU WOULD THINK I WOULD SAY IT -- HEADLINE, TRUMP SAID -- A RELEASE LAST WEEK, A BIG SHOW, CBS. THEY PUT OUT A RELEASE LAST WEEK. I DID A SHOW A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO FROM FLORIDA, WHERE I AM LEADING TO VERY LOW NUMBERS. I LOVE FLORIDA. WE WILL WIN -- WE WILL WIN FLORIDA. WE WILL WIN A LOT OF STATES NOBODY EVER THOUGHT ABOUT WINNING FOR. BUT FACE THE NATION PUT OUT A RELEASE LAST WEEK THAT WE HAD THEIR INTERVIEW WITH DONALD TRUMP COME A LONG INTERVIEW FROM FLORIDA, THAT IT WAS THE HIGHEST-RATED SHOW THEY HAVE HAD IN 15 OR 16 YEARS SINCE THE FALL THE WORLD TRADE CENTER. HIGHEST RELATED SHOW. IT GIVES YOU POWER. THAT GIVES YOU POWER. YOU LOOK AT THE DEBATES. TALKS AT 40 -- 24 MILLION, CNN SAID IT WAS THE LARGEST SHOW THEY HAVE EVER HAD. THEY COVER WARS AND DAYS EVENTS. THE BIGGEST RATINGS THEY EVER HAD WAS THE DEBATE. I KNOW THEY ARE NOT WATCHING JEB , A LOW-ENERGY PERSON. I KNOW THEY ARE NOT WATCHING TED. I DON'T WANT TO INSULT THE REST OF THEM. I GET ALONG WITH PEOPLE. I WANT TO BE NICE. I DON'T WANT HIM TO CALL ME AND SAY WHY DID YOU SAY THAT ABOUT ME. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT FOUR YEARS AGO AND EIGHT YEARS AGO, IT USED TO BE LIKE A THROW AWAY. THEY HAD TO DO IT AS PART OF THEIR LICENSING. THEY DID NOT EVEN WANT TO PUT THEM ON. IT IS NOW LIKE THEY CANNOT GET ENOUGH. IT IS THE DEBATE COMING UP HERE THE BIG DEBATE, IT IS CRAZY. EVERY MAGAZINE, THEY CALL IT THE TRUMP DEBATE. IT GIVES US SOME POWER BECAUSE WE ARE THE SILENT MAJORITY THAT IS TURNED INTO THE NORTH THE MAJORITY.  AND IT GIVES US POWER. THE SAME THING WITH MEET THE PRESS. CHUCK TODD IS A NICE GUY. THEY WERE DOWN IN THE TOILET WITH THE RATINGS. THEN I FINALLY AGREED TO DO A SHOW BECAUSE HE STARTED TO TREAT ME WITH RESPECT. HE WENT THROUGH THE ROOF. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WATCHING. THEY ALL SAID, WHAT HAPPENED. HE WILL PROBABLY GO IN AND GET A RAISE NOW. AND GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, WE DO HIS SHELL AND IT STEPS THROUGH THE ROOF. CNN, A GOOD GUY THERE. THEY GET GOOD RATINGS. GIVES US POWER. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE POLL NUMBERS. I CARE MORE ABOUT THE POLL NUMBERS. WHEN I SEE THOSE RATINGS, IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD BECAUSE THAT MEANS PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO OUR POINT OF VIEW. THAT IS WHAT IT MEANS.  SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS AN ADVERTISEMENT WAS PUT OUT BY TED CRUZ AND IT WAS SO FALSE ABOUT EMINENT DOMAIN. MOST PEOPLE DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS. IT IS WHERE GOVERNMENT TAKES PROPERTY FOR A FULL PAYMENT, THEY PAY YOU, THEY DO NOT JUST TAKE IT. THEY CALL IT A TAKING BUT YOU GOT PAID A FORTUNE. FRANKLY MORE THAN YOU NEVER GET BECAUSE YOU ARE DEALING WITH POLITICIANS AND POLITICIANS, AS WE HAVE LEARNED, THEY PAY TOO MUCH. IF YOU ARE BUILDING A ROAD, IF YOU ARE BUILDING A HIGHWAY, BECAUSE LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A COMMUNITY LIKE THIS, AND LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE, AND YOU NEED ROADS AND HIGHWAYS AND SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS, AND YOU MAY HAVE SOMEBODY WHO HAS A LITTLE FARM IN THE CORNER OF THE FAR MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD, LET'S SAY A SCHOOL OR A HOSPITAL OR LET'S SAY YOU CANNOT BUILD A HIGHWAY BECAUSE THE FARMER SAYS I DO NOT WANT TO SELL UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES HERE AT A HIGHWAY IS COMING, BUT YOU CAN'T GET THE LAND. IT IS CALLED EMINENT DOMAIN. THEY WILL TAKE THAT SLIVER AND THEY WILL PAY YOU A FORTUNE. THEY SAY IT IS FAIR MARKET VALUE BUT IT IS MORE THAN THAT IF YOU ARE SMART. THEY HAVE THIS THING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND EMINENT DOMAIN AND THAT I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH, YOU KNOW, THERE IS AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPER AND PROJECT WHERE I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO USE EMINENT DOMAIN. I ULTIMATELY DID NOT USE IT BUT THEY SAID IN THE AD THAT I DID AND THAT I RIPPED DOWN THIS HOUSE FROM AN OLD WOMAN. IT NEVER HAPPENED. IF I DID, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS OF JOBS. BUT IT NEVER HAPPENED. THEY HAVE BULLDOZERS RIPPING DOWN. FALSE STUFF. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT EMINENT DOMAIN P WROTE ALL OF THESE CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE, THE NATIONAL REVIEW IS A DYING MAGAZINE. DOES ANYBODY HERE READ IT? NOBODY. IT IS DYING. THE THING IS THAT AS A DOORNAIL. IT IS GOING TO BE CLOSED. I BET IT IS CLOSE IN A SHORT TIME. WHAT THEY DID IS THEY HAVE A COUPLE OF GUYS AT THE LEAD AND THEY GOT SOME PUBLICITY AND IT IS PROBABLY THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO ME BECAUSE MY POLL NUMBERS WENT THROUGH THE ROOF BECAUSE NOBODY RESPECT THE PEOPLE. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT SAID VERY STRONGLY THAT TRUMP WILL NEVER RUN. IF HE DOES RUN, IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN HERE HE DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. THEN THEY SAID HE WILL NEVER SIGN FORM  THEN THEY SAY NEVER PUT IN HIS FINANCIALS BECAUSE MAYBE HE'S NOT AS RICH AS EVERYONE THINKS THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO HURT HIS IMAGE. TURNS OUT I MUCH RICHER THAN ANYONE NEW. ALMOST 100 PAGES OF FINANCIALS. THEY WERE GREAT. TURNBERRY IN SCOTLAND WEATHER PLAY THE BRITISH OPEN. SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. IT TURNED OUT TO BE GREAT. TREMENDOUS CASH FLOW. I WANTED PEOPLE TO SEE IT. THESE GUYS WENT DOWN AND SAID THIS WAS BAD NEWS. AND I PUT THEM IN RIGHT DIDN'T AS FOR EXTENSIONS. THEY SAID HE WILL ASK FOR AN EXTENSION BECAUSE YOU'RE ENTITLED TO MANY EXTENSIONS. MANY OF THE POLITICIANS WHO FILED A ONE OR TWO PAGE REPORT AS FOR EXTENSIONS. AND PEOPLE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. THAT'S THE KIND OF THINKING OUR COUNTRY NEEDS TO MAKE US GREAT AGAIN AND STRONG AGAIN AND ALL OF THESE THINGS.  AS AN EXAMPLE WITH CHINA WE HAVE POLITICAL HACKS THAT ARE NEGOTIATING. WE HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA OF -- IT USED TO BE. I HEARD THIS MORNING A MORE ACCURATE NUMBER. $505 BILLION. AND THEN OBAMA SAYS OUR PARTNER CHINA -- I LOVE CHINA. THESE PEOPLE COME TO ME AND BY MY APARTMENTS. THE BIGGEST BANK IN THE WORLD IS IN CHINA. THEY ARE A TENANT AND WHEN MY BUILDINGS IN MANHATTAN. I OWN A BIG BUILDING IN SAN FRANCISCO ALONG WITH A GROUP THAT IS A GREAT GROUP. WE ON THE BANK OF AMERICA BUILDING IN SAN FRANCISCO. I AM ANOTHER ONE, 1290 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS. WINS. THAT'S HOW I GOT THEM. IV CHINA. -- I BEAT CHINA. OUR COUNTRY DOES NOT WIN ANY MORE. THAT'S THE KIND OF THINKING WE HAVE. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE REAL STIFFS. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT SHOULD NEVER BE DOING WHAT THEY ARE DOING. I LOOK AT THE STUFF AND I SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING AND I LOOK AT TED AND I SAY WAIT A MINUTE, I PUT IN THIS REPORT AND ALL THESE PEOPLE FOR THE NATIONAL REVIEW SAID I WOULD NOT RUN OR FILE. WHEN I FOUND MY FINANCIALS, IT WAS BY GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL IN FRONT OF THE FEDERAL ELECTIONS COMMISSION WITH REPORTERS. WHAT DO THEY GET INSTEAD? TED CRUZ WITH A COUPLE OF PAGES. HE FORGOT TO SAY THAT GOLDMAN SACHS GAVE HIM MONEY. HE FORGOT TO SAY THAT CITIBANK GAVE HIM MONEY. HE IS A MAN OF THE PEOPLE. HE IS ROBIN HOOD. THESE THIS GREAT MAN OF THE PEOPLE EVEN THOUGH NOBODY LIKES HIM OR NO SENATORS ENDORSED HIM AND HE IS A NASTY GUY. HE'S GOING TO HELP PEOPLE. HE DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW YOU BORROWED FROM GOLDMAN SACHS. GOLDMAN SACHS HAS HIM. CITIBANK HAS HIM. HE IS GOING TO COME OUT WITH RULINGS AGAINST GOLDMAN SACHS AND YES A PERSONAL AGREEMENT, I DON'T THINK SO. HE SAID HE DID NOT KNOW. HE'S GOT TO BANKS. --TWO BANKS. HOW DO NOT PUT THAT IN YOUR PERSONAL DISCLOSURE FORM? IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. SMART GUY. YOU KNOW YOU HAD BANKS AND IN THE PUT THEM. HE DIDN'T WANT THE PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT GOLDMAN SACHS OWES MONEY TO HIM AND HE'S THAT GUARANTEES WITH GOLDMAN SACHS. HE'S GOT VERY LOW INTEREST RATE LOANS. HE'S GOT LOW INTEREST RATE LOANS. THEY ARE LIKE PEANUTS. WHEN GOLDMAN SACHS GOES TO THE SENATOR IN TEXAS IN THE CASE OF THE PEOPLE FROM TEXAS AND THEY SAY WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS THAT HE'S GOING TO DO IT. ON THAT TAKING ANYBODY'S MONEY.  THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH TED IS, AS YOU KNOW, LAURENCE TRIBE, A GREAT CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER FROM HARVARD SAID THIS IS AN UNSETTLED MATTER. THIS GREAT CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER. OTHERS HAVE COME UP AND SAID HE CAN'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT. MAYBE HE CAN, MAYBE HE CAN'T. I DON'T KNOW. HE SHOULD GO TO COURT AND SEEK A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT. PEOPLE VOTING FOR TED CRUZ -- THERE IS A REAL CHANCE HE IS NOT ALLOWED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. HE CAN RUN FOR PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA.  PEOPLE LAUGH BUT IT'S TRUE. HE QUALIFIES BECAUSE HE WAS BORN ON CANADIAN SOIL. THEN HE SAID ANOTHER BEAUTY. HE WAS A CITIZEN OF CANADA UNTIL 15 MONTHS AGO. DOES ANYBODY KNOW THIS? HE'S A CITIZEN OF CANADA. HE IS A CITIZEN OF CANADA AND SOMEBODY FOUND OUT. REPORTERS ULTIMATELY FIND OUT ANYTHING. MUCH OF IT IS FALSE WITH THIS HAPPENS TO BE TRUE. HE'S A CITIZEN OF CANADA AND THEY SENT -- AND THEY SAID YOUR CITIZEN OF CANADA. THEY SAID HOW COULD IT BE YOUR CITIZEN OF CANADA? HE SAID HE DID NOT KNOW ABOUT IT. AND THERE ARE ADVANTAGES TO BEING CITIZENS OF DIFFERENT PLACES. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. HE DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD LOANS OUT THE GOLDMAN SACHS AND HE DIDN'T KNOW -- COME ON. ARE WE BABIES? ARE WE GOING TO FIND A WHAT HAPPENS. THEN HE MAKES A FALSE STATEMENT ABOUT ME THAT I'M RIPPING DOWN SOME WOMAN'S HOUSE THAT ULTIMATELY SO FORGET ABOUT IT. I SAVED A FORTUNE. IT WAS IN ATLANTIC CITY. I LEFT ATLANTIC CITY EIGHT OR NINE YEARS AGO. IT TOTALLY COLLAPSED. THE SMART PEOPLE GIVE ME AN A PROVISION. I LEFT. I WOULD HAVE BUILT THIS TOWER. THE WOMAN DID ME A BIG FAVOR BY NOT WANTING TO SELL. I NEVER RIPPED DOWN HER HOUSE. SHE WAS PERFECTLY FINE. THEY SHOW TRACKER STRIPPING DOWN HER HOUSE. -- TRACTORS RIPPING DOWN HER HOUSE. DO YOU THINK HE WILL APOLOGIZE? HE SHOULD GIVE ME AN APOLOGY. THEY SHOW A TRACTOR RIPPING DOWN SOMETHING. NOT HER HOUSE. BUT THEY SHOW THIS A BEAUTIFUL -- IT COULD BE A JOHN DEERE BUT THINK OF THE CATERPILLAR.  THAT WAS BEFORE. JAPAN IS SO DEVALUED THAT THE YEN IS HARD FOR CATERPILLAR AND JOHN DEERE. IV MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF IT. -- I BUY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF IT. MILLIONS. TED HAS A PROBLEM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS BUT I CAN SAY THAT THE POLLS THAT CAME UP THIS MORNING THERE HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS TURN. 12 POINTS OR 14 POINTS OF SWING. WE ARE WAY UP AND HE WENT WAY DOWN. ULTIMATELY YOU GOT TO GO CAUCUS. IF YOU DON'T GO OUT, YOU ARE NOT ENEMIES THIS COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN. IF YOU DON'T GO OUT AND DO IT THAT YOU HAVE THESE PEOPLE AT NATIONAL REVIEW. IT'S GOTTEN A LOT OF PUBLICITY. IT'S A FAILING MAGAZINE. GOT NO INFLUENCE WHATSOEVER. YOU HAVE BRENT BOZEL. HE'S UP IN MY OFFICE ASKING FOR MONEY. SOMETHING TO DO WITH ADVERTISING. I WANT MONEY. I WANT MONEY. I SAY WHAT -- WHO IS THIS GUY? SO I THINK ABOUT IT GIVEN HIM A CHECK FOR HIS GENERAL CONTRIBUTION. THIS WAS A LONG TIME AGO. I GAVE HIM MONEY. THEN HE CALLS AGAIN AND WANTS MORE MONEY. I SAID YOU CAN BE RICH, BUT WHY DO WE HAVE TO GIVE MONEY TO PEOPLE? I'D RATHER GIVE TO CHARITY. THE NEXT AND I HEAR HIS NAME I'M WRITING A PIECE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. I GUARANTEE YOU FOLKS IF I GAVE HIM MORE FUNNY, YOU GIVE IT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, BUT HE WOULD'VE BEEN FINE AND WOULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN THE PIECE. THEN YOU HAVE GLENN BECK. ALWAYS CRYING. BECAUSE FOX FIRED HIM. NOW WE HAS A LOSER GOING ON. IN ALL FAIRNESS I DON'T BLAME HIM. HE ASKED FOR AN INTERVIEW. DON'T FORGET UNTIL I DID THIS I WAS SORT OF NOT THINKING ABOUT THIS. I DID NOT GIVE HIM AN INTERVIEW ONLY BECAUSE I WAS BUSY. I DIDN'T GIVE HIM AN INTERVIEW. I PROBABLY WOULD'VE ACTED THE SAME WAY. HE CALLS MY PEOPLE AND I GO TO FIRST PLACE. I HAVE BEEN IN FIRST PLACE ALMOST AS THE DAY I ANNOUNCED.  AND PROBABLY MY PEOPLE -- YOUR PEOPLE ALL OF A SUDDEN BECOME GENIUSES. "" WE WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN HIM AN INTERVIEW."" I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM AN INTERVIEW BUT I DIDN'T DO IT. I DID NOT GIVE GLENN BECK AN INTERVIEW. HE ASKED MANY TIMES. HE SAID HIS FATHER IS IN THE HOSPITAL. HE WAS SICK AND NOT WELL. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WORKED OUT. I SAID I WILL DO YOUR SHOW. BOTTOM LINE IS PROBABLY CALLED UP AND WE DID NOT DO THE SHOW. HE COMES OUT AGAINST ME. IF I DID INTERVIEWS, HE WOULD NOT HAVE DONE IT. THAT'S THE WAY LIFE IS. YOU DON'T LEARN THIS AT THE WHARTON SCHOOL OF FINANCE WITH US THE WAY LIFE IS. I DON'T BLAME HIM. IF I CALL SOMEBODY AND HAD A NETWORK, THE FAMILY NETWORK -- A FAILING NETWORK ESPECIALLY AND THEY WOULD NOT DO THE INTERVIEW -- AND THERE WAS NO OTHER REASON OTHER THAN I HAD THINGS TO DO. IF I CALL SOMEBODY AND THEY WOULDN'T DO IT, PROBABLY I WOULD BE SWAYED TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF THEM. THEY CAME UP WITH A STUPID COVER. THEY HAVE 22 GUYS. I COULD GO OTHER EXAMPLES. SOME OF THEM ARE NICE PEOPLE AND A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT EVEN VERY VICIOUS. BUT THEY DID THIS AND THEY TRY TO SELL SOME MAGAZINES. THEY MIGHT SELL THIS ONE. THE NATIONAL REVIEW IS FINISHED. IF THE DETONATING. THEY CAME OUT AND THEY TRIED TO DO SOMETHING THAT WAS GOOD. THEY GOT SOME PUBLICITY. I THINK IT PROBABLY HELPS ME. HERE IS THE STORY. WE HAVE A VERY MAJOR ELECTION COMING UP. I THINK IT'S KIND OF IN THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION WE'VE HAD MODERN TIMES. OUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO HELL. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE INCOMPETENT LEADING OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE FRANKLY -- TRUMP LIKES TO SPEAK. I WENT TO AN IVY LEAGUE COLLEGE. I WENT TO THE WHARTON SCHOOL OF FINANCE WHICH IS THE BEST BUSINESS SCHOOL IN THE WORLD. I'M LIKE A SMART PERSON. IOWA; -- I ALWAYS SAY MY UNCLE, SLOW HORSES DON'T PRODUCE FAST HORSES. MY UNCLE WAS A PROFESSOR FOR YEARS. A GREAT ENGINEER. DR. JOHN TRUMP AT M.I.T.. THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM ARE SMART. MY PEOPLE ARE THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN MY OPINION. THEY GET IT. THESE OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE. THE MOST LOYAL AND THE SMARTEST. THE MOST LOYAL IN THE SMARTEST.  YOU LOOK AT WHAT GOES ON. WE KNOW AND WE SEE AND THEY ALWAYS LIKE TO SAY HE IS PLAINSPOKEN. IS THAT A POSITIVE OR NOT? THINK OF IT. WHEN YOU HAVE A WORD TO DESCRIBE YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY, WHAT'S A BETTER WORD THAN THE WORD ""STUPID?"" THERE IS NO BETTER WORD. I CAN GO THROUGH A THESAURUS AND COME UP WITH OTHERS, BUT THERE IS NO BETTER WORD. PRIDE? I USED TO SAY INCOMPETENT, BUT STUPID IS BETTER. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE DEALS THAT WE MAKE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE DO WITH CHINA, WITH WHAT WE DO WITH MEXICO -- MEXICO ARE FRIENDS OF MINE. I EMPLOY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HISPANICS. IN NEVADA I AM MEETING. -- LEADING. I SAID I'M GOING TO WIN WITH HISPANICS AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS. I'M GETTING GREAT AMERICAN -- NUMBERS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS BECAUSE OF GOING TO GIVE JOBS TO PEOPLE. WHAT HAS OBAMA DONE FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS? THEY ARE RELATIVELY SPEAKING THE WORST SHAPE THEY HAVE BEEN IN. YOU LOOK AT KIDS. 58% UNEMPLOYMENT. YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE THAT ARE 35-50, AND THEIR PRIME, UNEMPLOYMENT IS THROUGH THE ROOF. OBAMA HAS DONE NOTHING. WITH HIM IT IS ALL TALK. ALL TALK, NO ACTION. JUST A BAD GUY. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. I THOUGHT OBAMA WOULD BE A GREAT CHEERLEADER AT MINIMUM TO THIS COUNTRY. GUESS WHAT? HE HAS BEEN A HORRIBLE CHEERLEADER FOR OUR COUNTRY. HE HAS BEEN A DIVIDER. OUR COUNTRY IS DIVIDED. IT'S DIVIDED VERY BADLY.  AND WE HAVE TO BRING IT BACK. IF WE DON'T BRING IT BACK, WE WILL HAVE A PROBLEM. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS ABOUT ME. I AM A CHEERLEADER. I AM SOMEBODY THAT DOES UNIFY. A WOMAN CAME UP TO ME YESTERDAY. I DID TWO SPEECHES YESTERDAY PACKED HOUSES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF IOWA. A BEAUTIFUL, WONDERFUL WOMAN SAYS, MR. TRUMP, MY FRIENDS ARE CONCERNED IF YOUR PRESIDENT WOULD YOU STILL SPEAK SO TOUGH? I SAY NO, IT IS DIFFERENT. THERE'S A LITTLE TRUTH OF THAT. YOU WANT TO EASE UP? I'M RUNNING ORIGINALLY AGAINST 17 PEOPLE. FOUR OR FIVE ARE DOWN THE TUBES AND NOW WE HAVE A BIG GROUP DOUBLE BE DOWN THE TUBES DESPITE ALL THE MONEY. CAN YOU IMAGINE ALL THE MONEY THEY SPENT AND THEY ARE NOW DOWN THE TUBES. I SAID TO HER -- SHE SAID THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE AGAINST YOU IS A MAJOR RHETORIC IS TOUGH. HAPPY SKIES -- HALF THESE GUYS LIE. TRUMP, TRUMP, HIT TRUMP.  I SAID I HAVE TO USE IN DEALING WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE AND THAT I WANT TO DEAL WITH HILLARY IF I DON'T -- IF SHE DOESN'T GO TO JAIL ARE BERNIE OR BLOOMBERG WHICH WOULD BE GREAT. I LOVE THE COMPETITION. I LOVE BLOOMBERG TO COME IN. I'M DEALING WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE. I HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT TOUGH AND QUICK BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO BE SO NICE. IF I'M PRESIDENT, I WOULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. THE DEMEANOR WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT DON'T WORRY IT WILL BE THE SAME ATTITUDE.  HE SAID PLEASE DON'T CHANGE. DON'T WORRY. I'LL BE A LITTLE SOFTER. MAYBE THE ATTITUDE WILL BE TOUGHER BUT THE WORDS OF THE SOFTER. I TELL PEOPLE IT'S EASY. I COULD BE SO POLITICALLY CORRECT. I GOT A PALM BEACH. I OWN A GREAT PLACE IN PALM BEACH. WE HAVE THE GREAT SOCIETY PEOPLE IN PALM BEACH THAT ALWAYS WILL BE SITTING NEXT TO THEM. I SIT NEXT THE LADIES. ""DONALD, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL TO HAVE YOU WITH US.""   IN MODERN DAY SOCIETY DO NOT ALLOWED TO SAY THAT ABOUT A WOMAN. I'VE NEVER HAD ANYBODY COMPLAIN. THEY ARE VERY UP IN THE AIR AND VERY NICE PEOPLE AND THEY RAISE A LOT OF MONEY FOR CHARITY. I'M SO POLITICALLY CORRECT. THEY SAY WE CAN'T BELIEVE THE SOPHISTICATED DONALD IS. I CAN DO IT ANY DIFFERENT WAY. OUR COUNTRY HAS THE PROBLEM. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?  IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME.  IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME. SO WHEN I BEGAN THIS JOURNEY COMING DOWN THE ESCALATOR, IT LOOKED LIKE THE ACADEMY AWARDS. LOOK BACK THERE AT ALL THESE GUYS. WHO HAS THAT? ON A SUNDAY MORNING. HERE WE ARE IN IOWA. LOOK. UNBELIEVABLE. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN. THIS ONE SECTION FOR STRUCTURAL REASONS THEY CANNOT HAVE PEOPLE UP THERE. WATCH. EVERY SINGLE SEAT. PEOPLE ARE OUTSIDE STANDING. FOR STRUCTURAL REASONS IT'S UNDER REPAIR. THEY WILL PROBABLY HAVE ONE WISEGUY SHOW THAT ONE SECTION. ""NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE TURNED OUT.""   PLEASE, THEY ARE DISGUSTING. THAT'S WHY I LIKE OUR PROTESTERS. THEY HAVE TO SHOW UP. I TELL THIS STORY. WHETHER MANY PEOPLE THERE? YEAH, IT'S ALL LIVE ON CNN AND ALL OF THEM. DID YOU WATCH? SHE SAID DONALD, THEY NEVER LEAVE YOUR FACE. THEY NEVER LEAVE YOU. IT'S LIKE A TIGHT SHOT. THEY NEVER LEAVE YOUR FACE. I SAID I DON'T LIKE THAT. WE WERE IN LOWELL, MASSACHUSETTS IN A STADIUM. ORAL ROBERTS UNIVERSITY. THE PLAYSET 12,000-13,000 PEOPLE. WE HAD TO SEND AWAY 5000 OR 7000 PEOPLE. THEY NEVER ONCE SHOW THE STADIUM. MY WIFE SAID WERE THERE MANY PEOPLE? DIDN'T THEY SHOW IT? NO. SHE SAID I COULD TELL BY THE SOUND THERE HAD TO BE A LOT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE A BRRR. SHE SAID I COULD TELL THEM ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT THEY NEVER SHOWED IT.  TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP.  IF YOU SEE THE SECTION UNDER REPAIR AND YOU SEE THESE SLEAZE BAGS SHOWING IT, REMEMBER WHAT I SAID. THEY ARE THE WORST. THEY ARE SO DISHONEST. I WANT TO BACKTRACK. I WANT TO SAY THIS ABOUT CONSERVATIVES. ""DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A TRUE CONSERVATIVE."" BEST JEB BUSH. ""DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A TRUE CONSERVATIVE."" THIS GUY WILL GET YOU NOTHING DONE. HE SPENT $100 MILLION. HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS. ONE OF THE THINGS THEY SAY IS EMINENT DOMAIN. ALL CONSERVATIVES WANT THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE. IS THAT RIGHT? I WANT IT. HERE IS MY DEAL. OBAMA EITHER APPROVES OR HE DOESN'T. HILLARY SAYS NO GOOD. YOU KNOW WHY HILLARY IS WITH OBAMA ON SOME OF THE THINGS? WHY? SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO JAIL. THE MAN IN THE FRONT ROW GETS IT. YOU HAVE NOT BEEN AT ONE OF MY DEALS, WHERE YOU? HE GETS IT. HE WAS A NUMBER SIX. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE HIM ON. SHE IS SAYING THINGS AND SHE WILL UNTIL THE END. SHE IS AGAINST THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE. ALL THE CONSERVATIVES ARE FOR IT. HERE IS THE DIFFERENCE. I AM FOR IT. WITH THE HELP DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? -- WHAT THE HELL DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? I LOVE CANADA. YOU KNOW WHO'S GOING TO APPROVE THAT DEAL FAST, TED CRUZ. HE'S IN CANADA.  I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT. TED CRUZ WILL APPROVE THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE BECAUSE IT BENEFITS CANADA. IT'S GREAT. THEY CAN BE THE ONLY GUY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND THEN HE WILL RUN FOR PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA. ANYWAY, WITHOUT EMINENT DOMAIN -- THESE GUYS ALL SAY ""DONALD TRUMP IS AGAINST EMINENT DOMAIN."" I WANT TO HAVE A HIGHWAY BUILT. YOU KNOW WHAT CAN'T BE BUILT WITHOUT EMINENT DOMAIN? THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE. NO PIPELINE CAN BE BUILT BECAUSE IT GOES THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM CANADA DOWN TO TEXAS. A GOES THROUGH FARMLAND AND A GOES THROUGH A PERSON'S HOUSE. WITHOUT THIS -- WHEN YOU LOOK UNDER THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE, THEY HAVE A WHOLE SECTION DEDICATED TO EMINENT DOMAIN. WHAT IT MEANS, HOW WE WILL USE IT. NOW THEY'RE SAYING I'M NOT A CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE OF EMINENT DOMAIN. BUT YOU NEEDED OR YOU WANT HAVE ROADS IN THE COUNTRY. I SAY THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT EMINENT DOMAIN. PROBABLY CONNECTED 20 FEET. -- PROBABLY COULD NOT GO 20 FEET. THEY TAKE THE PROPERTY. THEY PAY YOU A FORTUNE. THERE ARE PEOPLE TO MAKE A LIVING OFF OF BUYING IMMINENT DOMAIN LANDS. THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO PAY FAIR MARKET VALUE BUT YOU'RE NEGOTIATING WITH THE GOVERNMENT SO MR. STUPID TO GET MORE MONEY THAN IT'S WORTH. IF YOU LISTEN TO THEM, THEY TALKED ABOUT IT THE OTHER DAY, "" DONALD TRUMP LESION THE TAKING OF PROPERTY."" THEY FORGOT TO SAY YOU GET A FORTUNE FOR IT. THESE ARE DISHONEST PEOPLE. EMINENT DOMAIN, KEYSTONE PIPELINE. HERE IS THE DIFFERENCE. THE CONSERVATIVES WANT AN APPROVES. WE HAVE THE DEMOCRATS THAT SAY NO. A LOT OF THE DEMOCRATS THINK IT SHOULD BE APPROVED, BY THE WAY. BUT YOU HAVE A GROUP THIS IS NO. WE HAVE A GROUP THAT SAYS YES. HERE IS WHAT I SAY. YES. BUT I'M NOT FINISHED. FOR THE COUNTRY, I WANT TO TAKE FOR THE UNITED STATES -- WHY SHOULD WE LET THEM BUILD THIS MASSIVE PIPELINE USING EMINENT DOMAIN AND GO THROUGH ALL THESE FARMS AND FARMLAND IN CITIES AND WHEREVER THE HELP THEY ARE GOING -- HELL THEY ARE GOING? I WANT 25% OF THE DEAL FOR THE UNITED STATES. THEY WILL MAKE A FORTUNE.  WHEN THEY DO THIS PIPELINE IT WILL BE A VERY PROFITABLE THING. IT'S REALLY CANADA OIL COMING DOWN. I LIKE CANADA AND I WANT THEM TO BE HAPPY. I WANT THE DEVELOPERS THE PIPELINE TO GIVE UNITED STATES A BIG, BIG CHUNK OF THE PROFITS OR EVEN OWNERSHIP RIGHTS. LIKE I DO IN BUSINESS. THAT'S WHAT I DO. HERE IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW. IT'S SO SIMPLE BUT YOU'D NEVER HEARD OF IT. NOW EVERYONE SAYS TAKE THE OIL. I SENT IN IRAQ -- TAKE THE OIL. NOW THEY ARE ALL SAYING IT. WITH THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE I WANT A BIG PIECE OF THE DEAL. OTHERWISE I'M NOT GOING TO APPROVE IT. THEY WILL GIVE US A LOT. I DON'T BE TOO GREEDY, BUT IF I AM, I'M GREEDY FOR THE COUNTRY. WHEN THEY DID THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE I WANT IT APPROVED. I LIKE A LOT OF OIL FLOW. RIGHT NOW WE ARE LOW BUT A MEMBER OPEC AND I NEVER WANT TO BE IN THAT POSITION AGAIN. DOESN'T THAT MAKE SENSE? YOU WILL NOT HEAR THAT FROM ANYONE ELSE.  TOMORROW YOU WILL HAVE ALWAYS BLOODSUCKERS GOING I HAVE AN IDEA. I WANT A PIECE OF THE DEAL -- THEY WOULD NOT KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN. CARL ICAHN, MANY OTHER BUSINESSMEN WANT TO ENDORSE ME. THEY SAY HE'S THE ONE THAT GETS IT. WE HAVE CORPORATE INVERSIONS GOING ON FOR COUNTRIES ARE LEAVING THE UNITED STATES. THEY USED TO LEAVE IOWA AND GO SOME OTHER PLACE. SOME WENT TO MEXICO. NEW, IOWA. -- NEWTON, IOWA. THEY WOULD BE THESE PLACES AND GO TO FLORIDA. NOW THEY LEAVE NEW JERSEY AND THE GOOD IRELAND. PFIZER IS GOING TO RHODE ISLAND. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF JOBS BECAUSE THEY CAN BRING THEIR MONEY BACK INTO THE COUNTRY AND BECAUSE THE TAXES ARE TOO HIGH. MY TAX PLAN IS AN AMAZING PLAN. IT'S GOING TO MAKE US SO DYNAMIC. LARRY, A GREAT GUY, SAID IT'S A PHENOMENAL PLAN. IT'S GOING TO LOWER TAXES FOR CORPORATIONS. LOWER TAXES FOR BUSINESS. GET RID OF A LOT OF RULES AND REGULATIONS. AS FARMERS, PEOPLE THAT HAVE FARMS ARE TELLING ME STORIES THAT ARE A DISASTER. THEY CAN'T EVEN TAKE CARE OF THEIR FARMS ANYMORE BECAUSE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUFF. WE WILL BRING IT BACK AND WE WOULD GO BACK TO SATURDAY AND DO THINGS THAT ARE INCREDIBLE. WE ARE GOING TO DO THINGS THAT ARE INCREDIBLE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE ARE NOW THE HIGHEST TAXED NATION IN THE WORLD. WE WILL MAKE IT SO WE ARE ONE OF THE LOWEST. WE ARE GOING TO BECOME A DYNAMIC FORCE AGAIN.  ALL OF THAT MONEY, AT LEAST $2.5 TRILLION OFFSHORE. THE DEMOCRATS WANTED BROUGHT BACK IN. THEY CANNOT GET IT BACK IN. THEY SPEND IT HERE BUT THEY CAN'T BECAUSE IT SO RESTRICTIVE. THEY CAN'T DO IT BUREAUCRATICALLY. ALL $2.5 TRILLION, THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO IDEA. JUST LIKE THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY ILLEGALS ARE IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY HAVE NO IDEA GOES ON THE OBAMACARE WEBSITE THAT COST $5 BILLION. IT STILL DOESN'T WORK. ALL THAT MONEY DOES OFFSHORE, THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WANT IT. THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR THREE AND HALF YEARS AND THEY CAN GET TOGETHER. THEY HAVE NO LEADER. EVERY DEMOCRAT ONCE IT, EVER REPUBLICAN. WE WANT MONEY BROUGHT BACK INTO THE COUNTRY. THE REASON THEY CAN'T GET IT DONE IS NO LEADERSHIP. IT'S ONE THING IF THEY ARE OPPOSED -- SOMEBODY WANTS OBAMACARE AND SOMEBODY DOESN'T. IS A LOGJAM. HERE IS SOMETHING WITH A WANT THE MONEY TO COMMAND AND THEY CAN'T -- COME IN AND THEY CAN'T GET IT DONE. THERE IS TOTAL GRIDLOCK IN WASHINGTON. I DOUB -- A GUY LIKE TED CRUZ CAN NEVER GET IT DONE. IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU NEED TO ME THAT CAN WE WIN DEAL AND GET THINGS DONE. -- WHEEL AND DEAL AND GET THINGS DONE. ALL OF OBAMA DOES NOW IS SIGNED EXECUTIVE ORDERS. HE CAN'T GET IT -- BOOM. EXECUTIVE ORDER. THEY WILL SAY -- HERE IS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. IN FIVE YEARS, DON'T WORRY, I'M PLAYING GOLF. REMEMBER RONALD REAGAN AND TIP O'NEILL WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS RUNNING GOOD. THEY GOT ALONG AND YOU GOT CONGRESS. THESE DOING AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT. HOW TERRIBLE IS THAT. WE CAN'T DO THAT STUFF. HERE IS THE STORY. I WAS TALKING ABOUT TRADE. I WAS TALKING ABOUT CHINA, JAPAN , MILLIONS OF CARS POURING IN AND WE GET EMPHATICALLY NOTHING. I WAS TALKING ABOUT MEXICO. THEY BEAT US IN TREE AND AT THE BORDER. DRUGS ARE COMING ACROSS. ANCHOR BABIES, WHICH I WAS RIGHT ABOUT. THE FACT IS SOMEBODY HAS A BABY THAT IS IN A LEGAL IS IT ME WITH TO TAKE CARE THAT BABY FOR THE NEXT 90 YEARS. I AM RIGHT.  AND WE DON'T NEED A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. I WAS RIGHT. SOME OF THE GREATEST LAWYERS IN THE WORLD TO TRUMP WAS RIGHT. ALL THE THINGS THEY TALK ABOUT. THEN YOU HAD HARRIS IN LOS ANGELES AND -- PARIS AND LOS ANGELES AND OTHER THINGS HAPPEN. AND THEN CNN DOES A POLL. IT WAS BEST OF THE ECONOMY? TRUMP BY A FACTOR OF MANY TIMES. IN THE 60'S AND 70'S. I WILL BE THE GREATEST JOBS PRESIDENT GOD EVER CREATED.  THE ECONOMY -- THEN BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN PARIS AND CALIFORNIA THEY STARTED TALKING ABOUT HE WAS BEST ON SECURITY FOR THE COUNTRY. TRUMP. BEST OF THE MILITARY. TRUMP. IT WAS THE BEST ON ISIS. TRUMP. BY A LOT. AS IN THE NARRATIVE STARTED CHANGING. I WAS TALKING ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS. TRUST ME. TRADE IS GOING TO BE GREAT. WE WILL BRING BACK JOBS. WE WILL MAKE GOOD DEALS, NOT BAD DEALS. I WILL USE THE GREATEST BUSINESS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. I KNOW THE GOOD ONES, THE BAD ONES, THE ONES THAT ARE OVERRATED. THE ONE YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THAT ARE BETTER THAN ALL OF THEM. TO THEM IT IS SPORT. THEY LOVE THE COUNTRY, SOME OF THEM. SOME DON'T CARE. THESE ARE TOUGH PEOPLE. SOME WILL LIVE A COUNTRY OUT OF THE UNITED STATES IF THEY CAN SAVE A FEW DOLLARS. WE WILL HAVE THE BEST NEGOTIATORS IN THE WORLD NEGOTIATING AGAINST JAPAN AND MEXICO AND CHINA AND VIETNAM AND ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY KILLING US. WHAT CHINA HAS DONE TO US IS PERHAPS THE GREATEST THEFT IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US IS TAKEN SO MUCH MONEY OUT OF THIS COUNTRY AND WE GO THEM $1.7 TRILLION. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? THEY KILL US AND WE OF THE MONEY. JAPAN, WE GO THEM $1.5 TRILLION. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT. WE WILL KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF THEM.  REMEMBER, I AM THE MOST MILITARISTIC PERSON. I AM THE MOST MILITARISTIC PERSON. WE WILL BUILD OUR MILITARY STRONG AND POWERFUL. I HOPE WE NEVER HAVE TO -- I DON'T WANT TO USE IT. SOME PEOPLE SAY TRUMP IS VERY TOUGH AND HE MIGHT BE VERY QUICK ON THE TRIGGER. ALL THESE WEAK PEOPLE WANT TO USE OUR MILITARY. I SAID DON'T GO INTO IRAQ IN 2003. HE WILL DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST. I AM THE SAME ONE IN THE GROUP. -- SANE ONE IN THE GROUP. I WANT TO MAKE IT BIGGER AND BETTER AND STRONGER AND TECHNOLOGICALLY NOBODY CAN COMPETE.  I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO USE IT. AND GOING ALONG WITH THAT, I HAVE A LOT OF BAD STUFF. LUKE -- VET STUFF. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR V ETS. WE HAVE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TREATED BETTER THAN OUR VETS. THEY WILL BE TREATED RIGHT. THEY ARE OUR GREATEST PEOPLE. IN CLOSING, I JUST WANT TO SAY IT HAS BEEN WONDERFUL. YOU CAN READ ALL THE TIME MAGAZINE COVER STORIES YOU WANT. IN MY OPINION IF WE DON'T WIN, WE WASTED A LOT OF TIME. YOU HAVE GOT TO GO CAUCUS. OTHERWISE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS AMAZING. HERE IS WHAT WE'RE SAYING. IF TRUMP WIN IOWA, THEY GIVE YOU A LOT OF POWER, IF TRUMP WINS IOWA HE WILL RUN THE TABLE.  IF I DON'T WIN IOWA, AND ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, I HAVE TO GO TO NEW HAMPSHIRE WHERE I HAVE A MASSIVELY. LIKE A 20 POINT LEAD. INCREDIBLE PEOPLE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. IF I DON'T WIN, AND I THINK WE GOING TO WIN ANYWAY BECAUSE ANSWER IS STRONG. SOUTH CAROLINA IS THROUGH THE ROOF. WE HAVE A HUGE LEAD IN NEVADA. GEORGE IT IS AMAZING. FLORIDA, 40%. -- 48%. IF I CAN WIN IOWA, WE WILL RUN THE TABLE. I WANT YOU TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT. BUT I HONESTLY BELIEVE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT HAD A WINNER IN SO LONG. YOU WILL HAVE A WINNER. I GIVE YOU MY WORD, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A WINNER.    LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU TOO. I DO. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY STRONG AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR CENTURY SMART AGAIN. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO RESPECT US AGAIN. WHEN YOU SEE TEN YOUNG SAILORS SITTING IN A VOTE ON THE HANDS AND KNEES WITH THEIR HANDS UP IN THE AIR AND THEY ARE IN A BAKING POSITION AND YOU HAVE THOUGHTS OF GUNS SO THERE HAD MAKING THEM SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT TO SAY, AND THE ONLY REASON WE GOT THEM BACK IS THAT THEY HAPPENED TO BE SMART. TWO DAYS LATER THEY GOT $150 BILLION. IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT, THOSE SAILORS WOULD BE THERE UNTIL ABOUT FEBRUARY 1 OF THAT YEAR. THAT I CAN TELL YOU. BUT I THOUGHT THAT WAS A VERY HUMILIATING -- WAS THAT HUMILIATING? IF $150 BILLION WAS NOT COMING TO DAYS LATER, THOSE PEOPLE WOULD BE OVER THERE FOR YEARS TO COME IF YOU HAD A NORMAL PRESIDENT. HERE IS THE STORY. WE ARE GOING TO WIN AGAIN. WHO WILL MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN. WE WILL BE VERY PROUD OF THESE DAYS BUT YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND CAUCUS. THE MORE OF THE MANDATE WEEKEND WIN BY -- AND I DON'T WANT TO COME IN SECOND. IF I COME IN SECOND, EVERY WORD I SAY IS GOING TO COME BACK ON THAT LONG. THEY CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT. I WANT TO COME IN FIRST. WE NEED A MANDATE. WE NEED TO BRING -- GET OUR COUNTRY BACK. WHEN HE TO DO THINGS WE HAVE NEVER DONE BEFORE. WE CAN BE STRONGER AND BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE. FEBRUARY 1, GO CAUCUS. GET THAT THING DONE AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF FUN FOR A LOT OF YEARS. I LOVE YOU ALL. I LOVE YOU ALL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOLKS. APPRECIATE IT.           >>","Donald Trump Campaign Rally in Muscatine, Iowa"

THEY DO NOT HAVE THIS KIND OF A  CROWD, BUT THAT IS OK. I WILL SAY THIS, WHEN JERRY WAS SAYING NICE THINGS ABOUT OTHER  PEOPLE, THIS WAS VERY SMART AND THIS ONE'S GET IN THIS ONE SCUD AND TRUMP REMINDS ME OF MY FATHER, I SAID, THAT IS THE BEST COMPLIMENT OF ALL. YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD TO BE HERE. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AMAZING FUTURES. WE HAD A DEBATE RECENTLY AND THE DEBATE -- WATCH THE DEBATE? EVERYBODY? A VERY POLITICAL PLACE, OK?  IT WAS AN AMAZING EVENING FOR ME. WE DID FINE. WE DID WELL. PEOPLE'S CAME OUT OVER THAT AND THEY KEEP GOING UP.  I WILL NOT GO OVER THAT. SOMEBODY SAID, WHY DO YOU ALWAYS DISCUSS THE POOL? HE IS IN SEVENTH PLACE, I AM IN FIRST PLACE. I SAID, WHEN YOU ARE IN FIRST PLACE YOU DISCUSSED GOALS. IT IS TRUE. SO MANY THINGS HAVE HAPPENED AND NOW THEY KEEP COMING OUT AND WE GO UP AND UP AND UP. WE HAD 32% LAST WEEK. PEOPLE ARE DROPPING OUT RAPIDLY. WHEN YOU ARE AT 42% YOU KNOW YOU ARE NOT TOTALLY WASTING YOUR  TIME. I WOULD TAKE 42% IF WE HAD THREE PEOPLE, NOT 14. NBC WALL STREET JOURNAL JUST CAME OUT, 33%. CBS AND OTHERS, 41%.  CBS, 35%. GRAVIS, 34%. I AM NOT GOING TO BOTHER YOU. I WILL TELL YOU IN SOUTH CAROLINA WE'RE AT ALREADY 5%. WAY, WAY ABOVE ANYBODY ELSE. IN IOWA, CNN WAS 34%. THE CLOSEST IS IOWA. I LOVE IOWA. I AM GOING THERE RIGHT AFTER THIS. I AM GOING UP TO NEW HAMPSHIRE. BECAUSE I'M GOING TO WIN. EVERYBODY KEEPS AND, DON'T SAY THAT, SAY I THINK I'M GOING TO WIN. I AM GOING TO WIN IOWA. I HAVE DONE GREAT. WE HAVE DONE GREAT WITH THE EVANGELICALS. THE EVANGELICALS HAVE BEEN AMAZING. THE TEA PARTY HAS BEEN AMAZING. WE'RE DOING REALLY WELL THERE. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WE CAN REALLY SURPRISE A LOT OF  PEOPLE BY WINNING IN IOWA AND THEN WE WILL CLEAN THE TABLE. WE WILL GO THROUGH NEW HAMPSHIRE, SOUTH CAROLINA, RIGHT TO THE ROOF. I THINK WE CAN DO REALLY SOMETHING SPECIAL. AND, WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT  CHRISTIANITY A AND I CAN'T SAY THAT. I DO NOT HAVE TO BE POLITICALLY  WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT IT, YOU KNOW. 2 CORINTHIANS. WHERE THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS. IT IS SO TRUE. WHEN YOU THINK, IS THAT THE ONE? IS AT THE ONE YOU LIKE? I THINK THAT IS THE WHEN YOU LIKE, BECAUSE I LOVED IT. AND, IT IS SO REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT IS TAKEN PLACE. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. IF YOU LOOK AT SYRIA, IF YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN, THEY ARE CHOPPING UP HEADS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT PLACES, CHRISTIANITY IS UNDER SIEGE. I'M A PROTESTANT, PRESBYTERIAN TO BE EXACT. PRIVATE. VERY, VERY PROUD OF IT. WE HAVE TO PROTECTED BECAUSE  VERY BAD THINGS ARE HAPPENING. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS. WE DO NOT HAND TOGETHER, MAYBE. OTHER RELIGIONS, FRANKLY, THEY ARE BANDING TOGETHER. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS COUNTRY, IT HAS GOT TO BE 70%, SOME NEW 5%, SOME PEOPLE SAY EVEN MORE, THE  POWER WE HAVE SOMEHOW WE HAVE TO UNIFY.  WE HAVE TO BAND TOGETHER.  WITH TO DO A REALLY LARGE VERSION OF WHAT THEY HAVE DONE  AT LIBERTY. LIBERTY UNIVERSITY IS DONE THAT, YOU HAVE CREATED ONE OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITIES. ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY, ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. THAT IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY HAS TO DO AROUND CHRISTIANITY. SO, GET TOGETHER FOLKS AND LET'S DO IT. BECAUSE WE CAN DO IT.   NOWHERE -- NO MATTER WHAT I GO, WE HAVING TREMENDOUS CROWDS AND WE ARE DROP -- DRAWING CROWDS. MOBILE ALABAMA, 35 THOUSAND  PEOPLE. NO MATTER WHERE WE GO, EVEN HERE, I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE ROOMS ALL OVER WITH THE VARIOUS EQUIPMENT TO SHOW ON THE SCREENS. YOU HAVE A MUCH BETTER LOCATION THAN THEY DO BUT I WILL NOT TELL  THEM THAT. YOU HAVE ROOMS ALL OVER WITH THE MEDIA EQUIPMENT AND NO MATTER WHERE WE GO, BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU, THIS IS A MOVEMENT. AS A MOVEMENT GOING ON. WE WANT TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY  BACK. OUR COUNTRY IS DISAPPEARING. YOU LOOK AT THE KIND OF DEALS WE MAKE. YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING.  OUR COUNTRY IS GOING IN THE WRONG ELECTION. IT HAS GOT TO BE STOPPED AND IT HAS GOT TO BE STOPPED FAST.  WE CANNOT GO ANOTHER FOUR YEARS. I KNOW MAYBE HILLARY WILL BE HERE AND MAYBE YOU CAN PLAY THIS BACK. WE CANNOT HAVE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF BARACK OBAMA.  WE CANNOT HAVE ANOTHER FOUR  YEARS OF HILLARY CLINTON.   I WATCHED THAT DEBATE LAST NIGHT WITH THE THREE OF THEM. ONE OF THEM IS IN THERE, WHAT IS HE DOING? HE WAS THE MAYOR OF BALTIMORE, HIS BIG CLAIM TO FAME. THEN HE BECAME GOVERNOR AND DID A HORRIBLE JOB. HE WAS CONSTANTLY MENTIONING MY NAME.  DONALD TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP. I SAID, WHY DOES HE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT ME?  AND THEN THE OTHER TWO, YOU HAVE A SOCIALIST WHO IS HERE, ACTUALLY. I WAS GIVEN A SAY YOU HAVE A  SOCIALIST, IT COULD BE MUCH WORSE IN THAT. AND YOU HAVE HILLARY. DID ANYBODY WATCH THAT DEBATE LAST NIGHT? TREMENDOUSLY HIGH TAXES, THINGS WILL NOT HAPPEN WITH THE MILITARY. WE NEED TO BUILD OUR MILITARY SO BIG, SO STRONG, SO POWERFUL, THAT NOBODY, NOBODY IS GOING TO MESS WITH US. WE HAVE TO DO IT.   YOU KNOW, SOMEONE RECENTLY SAID OUR MILITARY IS  THE LEAST PREPARED IT HAS EVER BEEN. I GET LISTING OF DIFFERENT THINGS. AN ARMY BASE, A NAVAL BASE, EVERYTHING IS FOR SALE. IT IS FOR SALE. WE CANNOT HAVE THAT. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD IT DID, BUILD IT STRONG, HOPEFULLY NEVER HAVE TO USE IT. WE WILL BUILD IT SO STRONG NOBODY WILL EVER WANT TO MESS WITH THAT.  THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.  IN THE END, THAT IS CHEAPER THAN THE NONSENSE WE'RE DOING NOW. PEOPLE ARE LAUGHING AT US. WE CANNOT NEED ISIS. I SEE IT ON TELEVISION. THESE GENERALS GET UP AND THEY ARE BEING INTERVIEWED ON TELEVISION. I DO NOT WANT GENERALS TO BE INTERVIEWED. ONE OF THE GENERALS JUST  RECENTLY, WHEN YOU THINK OF THE  ISIS THREAT? HE SAID, THEY ARE VERY TOUGH. CAN WE BEAT THEM? HE SAID, WELL, IT IS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME. I DO NOT WANT THAT KIND OF GENERAL. I WANT TO A GENERAL WHERE WE  KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF THEM.   AND, MY GENERALS, BY THE WAY, THEY ARE NOT GOING ON TELEVISION. OK?  SO THE ENEMY CAN LEARN ALL ABOUT . HOW ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA RECENTLY? WE'RE SENDING 50 PEOPLE OVER THERE, OUR FINEST. WHY DOES HE SAY THAT?  THEY HAVE A TARGET ON THEIR BACK.  THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THOSE 50 PEOPLE RIGHT NOW MORE THAN ANY OTHER PEOPLE. WHAT IS HAVE TO SAY THAT? WHY CAN'T HE JUST DO IT AND NOT TALK ABOUT IT? RIGHT? WHY CAN'T HE DO IT AND NOT TALK ABOUT IT?   WHEN THE WAR STARTED, I WAS VERY OPPOSED TO IT. I USED TO TAKE A LITTLE HEAT ON THAT. NOW, I GET A LOT OF CREDIT FOR. BUT IN 2003-2000 OR, I SAID IF YOU DO THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST. THE CANNOT THEM OUT PRETTY EASILY, THE ONE THAT IS NOT KNOCKED OUT WILL TAKE OVER. SO WE KNOCK OUT A RACK, AND IRAN IS TAKING OVER THE MIDDLE EAST. -- WE KNOCK OUT IRAQ, AND IRAN IS TAKING OVER THE MIDDLE EAST. WE HAVE TOTALLY DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST.  IT IS A DISASTER. YOU LOOK AT THIS NEW IRAN DEAL, YOU LOOK AT HOW BAD AND ONE-SIDED IT IS, YOU LOOK AT HOW ONE-SIDED THIS DEAL IS. YESTERDAY I HEARD, WE ARE GETTING OUR HOSTAGES BACK. SOME PEOPLE CALL THEM PRISONERS, SOME PEOPLE CALLED THEM  HOSTAGES. I DON'T CARE. THE, WE'RE GETTING THEM BACK.  AND THEN I SAID, WHY WAIT A MINUTE THEY ARE GETTING SEVEN BACK, WE'RE GETTING FOR.  THEY SAID FIVE, BUT THE OTHER ONE THEY CANNOT FIND. I TELL YOU WHAT, THAT IS STRANGE. THAT IS ANOTHER THING WE WILL BE LOOKING INTO. WE'RE GETTING FOR BACK, THEY ARE GETTING SEVEN. THEY ARE GETTING 14 OFF OF THE IT WILL WATCH LIST. THESE ARE REAL BAD CUSTOMERS. THEY ARE GETTING ALL SORTS OF ADVANTAGES. UNBELIEVABLE ADVANTAGES. THEY ARE GOING TO BE AN IMMENSELY WEALTHY COUNTRY, AN IMMENSELY WEALTHY TERROR COUNTRY AND THEY ARE GETTING $150 BILLION. SO, WHEN OUR SAILORS WERE CAPTURED LAST WEEK, I SAID THAT IS THE ONE IN -- THAT IS ONE OF THE SADDEST THINGS I'VE SEEN. THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE ON THEIR HANDS INTO KNEES IN A BEGGING POSITION WITH BUGS DEFINED THEM WITH GUNS AND THEN WE TALK LIKE, IT IS OK. IT IS NOT OK. IT IS LACK OF RESPECT. WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN TO THIS COUNTRY. IT IS LACK OF RESPECT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN TO THE SCHEDULE. WE'RE GOING TO BE STRONG. WE'RE GOING TO BE VIGILANT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE POWERFUL AND  STRONG BORDERS. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING. IF YOU HAVE BEEN SEEING HER READING THE NEWS, THREE PEOPLE HAVE JUST BEEN KIDNAPPED IN IRAQ. BECAUSE THEY SEE WHAT THE HECK -- WE PAY $150 BILLION FOR FOUR PEOPLE. THREE PEOPLE JUST THIS MORNING  AND THIS IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE FOR ALL OF THEM. THEY SHOULD HAVE COME BACK AS  PART OF THE DEAL THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THEY STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE DEAL, NOT NOW.   WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED, WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED IS OUR REPRESENTATIVES -- FIRST OF ALL WE NEED PEOPLE WHO NEGOTIATE PROPERLY, NOT PEOPLE LIKE JOHN KERRY WHO DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE. WE WILL HAVE THOSE PEOPLE, I KNOW THOSE PEOPLE. WE WILL HAVE THOSE PEOPLE. BUT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WENT ON, OUR PEOPLE, ALL YOU HAD TO DO IS GO IN AND SAY TO THE PERSIANS, VERY GOOD NEGOTIATORS, GREAT NEGOTIATORS.  AIR KNOWN FOR IT. THEY ARE SITTING ACROSS THE TABLE. FELLOWS.  AND IN THIS CASE, IT IS ALL FELLOWS. I HATE TO TELL THIS TO THE  LIMIT. THEY ARE LITTLE BIT BEHIND EFFECT. THEY HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT YET THAT WOMEN ARE MAYBE WE BETTER THAN MEN BUT I WOULD GET MYSELF IN TROUBLE WITH MEN. BUT YOU SAY, FELLOWS, WE WANT OUR PRISONERS BACK.  WILL MAKE A BETTER DEAL. WE WANT OUR PRISONERS BACK. THEY WILL SAY, NO. WE WILL SAY, THAT IS OK. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT IT. BY. IT UP, LEAVE THE ROOM. -- GET UP AND LEAVE  WE HAVE BEEN MISMANAGED. WE OF $19 TRILLION IN DEBT. NOW MAYBE 21 MAIN DOLLARS. THAT RIDICULOUS BUDGET, AND -- WE CAN'T GIVE IT TO YOU. SORRY. YOU COULD'VE SAID IT, YOU COULD GOT THE PRISONERS OUT YEARS AGO FOR NOTHING. WITHOUT GIVING THEM THESE  PEOPLE. WHO, BY THE WAY, DESERVE TO HAVE  BEEN IN PRISON. THANKS WERE SERIOUS. AND THE INTERPOL PEOPLE? FORGET ABOUT IT. THESE ARE BAD PEOPLE. SAID THEY MADE THIS INCREDIBLE DEAL. BUT EVERYBODY MAKES GOOD DEALS WITH THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE THE WORLD IS MARKED AND THEY USE THEIR SMART PEOPLE AND THEY USE THEIR MOST CUNNING, STREETWISE  PEOPLE AND THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. WE WANT TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT, LIKE JERRY-SENIOR WOULD  SAY. WE WANT TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT AND IT IS JUST NOT  WORKING. ONE OF THE REASONS PEOPLE ARE SHOWING UP FOR ME AND THE POLLS ARE SHOWING UP FOR ME -- IT IS NOT THAT I WENT TO AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL AND ALL OF THAT STUFF, SMART GUY. I EVEN HAD AN UNCLE WHO WAS A PROFESSOR AT MI T FOR DECADES. A BRILLIANT GUY, DR. JOHN TRUMP. WE CAN ALL BE POLITICALLY CORRECT, BUT IT TAKES TO MUCH TIME. IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME. AND A LOT OF IT IS JUST WRONG. I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW MERRY CHRISTMAS? YOU DO NOT SEE IT ANYMORE. THEY WANT TO BE POLITICALLY  CORRECT. IF I AM PRESIDENT, YOU ARE GOING TO SEE MERRY CHRISTMAS IN DEPARTMENT STORES, BELIEVE ME. BELIEVE ME. YOU ARE GOING TO SEE IT. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF THINGS. BUT THAT IS ONE EXAMPLE. YOU GO SHOPPING TODAY, YOU DO NOT SEE IT ANYMORE. YOU HARDLY SEE ANYTHING.  YOU SEE WALLS. TAINTED RED.  YOU SAY, THAT IS GREAT. WONDERFUL. WE'RE GOING TO BE SAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN. I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE NOT CHRISTIANS, THEY LIKE TO SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS. THEY LOVE IT. EVERYBODY LOVES IT. BUT WE HAVE TAKEN IT OUT OF OUR THE CAPILLARY. -- OUT OF OUR VOCABULARY. >> I LOVE YOU!  I LOVE YOU TOO. THANK YOU. YOU NEVER KNOW THAT IS. AFTER YESTERDAY, I CAME HOME AND SAID TO MY WIFE, DARLING, HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS? SHE SAID, THAT'S GOOD HOW MANY  PEOPLE WERE THERE? THEY FOCUS ON MY FACE, THEY NEVER SHOW THE CROWDS. SO SHE SAID, HOW MANY ARE THERE. SHE WOULD SAY, HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE THERE, DARLING? AND I WOULD SAY, THE PLACE IS PACKED I HAD TO HAVE 15,000 OR 18,000 PEOPLE. IN ONE CASE, WE SENT AWAY 7000. YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT?  AND SHE SAID, NO. THEY FOCUS ON YOUR FACE. THE CAMERAS ARE IN A FIXED POSITION. I FIGURED IF THEY ARE FIXED THEY COULD NOT MOVE.  EXCEPT, EVERY TIME THERE WAS A  PROTESTER THOSE CAMERAS WERE LIKE A PRETZEL. I LOVE THE PROTESTERS.  WE DON'T HAVE ANY, HONESTLY. I LOVE THE PROTESTERS BECAUSE OF THE CAMERAS REP AND THAT CORNER,  THEY WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT THE PROTESTERS THEY WOULD SAY, WOW, THAT PLACE IS PACKED. BECAUSE IT IS A MOVEMENT. BUT I HAVE TO SAY THE PRESS IS VERY VERY DISHONEST. NOW, NOT ALL OF THEM. BUT MOST OF THEM. VERY DISHONEST. VERY, VERY DISHONEST. AND ACTUALLY, I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING.  I HAVE SEEN FINANCIAL PRESS AND THEY PLAY GAMES. YOU KNOW, NUMBERS OR NUMBERS. THIS POLITICAL PRESS IS BRUTAL. NOW, 25% ARE GOOD. PERCENT ARE GREAT. THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. DO YOU AGREE? THE CAMERA CHECK. I COLORED THE CAMERA TRICK, BUT THEY DON'T SHOW. -- I CALL IT THE CAMERA TRICK, WHICH THEY DO NOT SHOW. IT IS A SILENT MAJORITY, BUT I THINK I'M GOING TO UP THE LITTLE BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER SO SILENT.  IT HAS BECOME A NOISY MAJORITY. PEOPLE WANT TO SEE GREATNESS FOR  OUR COUNTRY.  THEY WANT TO SEE THINGS HAPPEN. THEY WANT TO SEE THINGS HAPPEN. AND, THEY ARE NOT SEEING IT. THESE POLITICIANS ARE ALL TALK, NO ACTION, THEY DO NOT GET IT DONE. WHEN I SAY WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A WALL, THEY SAY, BUT YOU TALKING ABOUT THE CANNOT BUILD A WALL. AND I SAY WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT? CHINA. CHINA.  THINK ABOUT IT. 2000 YEARS AGO, CHINA DON'T GREAT WALL OF CHINA. THIS IS A SERIOUS WALL. AND, THEY DID NOT HAVE CATERPILLAR TRACTORS OR KOMAT SUS. AND WE HAVE TO STOP THAT BECAUSE  IT IS COMING OUT OF JAPAN NOW. THEY SAY, YOU CANNOT BUILD A  WALL AND I SAY, NOT ONLY CAN I BUILD IT AND THEY ARE SAYING, YOU CANNOT BUILD A WALL, CAN YOU?  THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX THE INFRASTRUCTURE. OUR BRIDGES ARE KREMLIN. OUR ROADS ARE CRUMBLING. WE SPENT $5 MILLION IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND OUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO HELL. WE HAVE GOT TO BRING IT BACK.  WE HAVE GOT TO KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF ISIS. BY THE WAY, I DID NOT WANT TO GO TO IRAQ, BUT I DID NOT WANT TO GET OUT THE WAY WE GOT OUT. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED, AND I  HAVE SAID THIS FOR YEARS. I PROBABLY SAID THIS LAST TIME I  WAS HERE, YEARS AGO. TAKE THE OIL. TAKE THE. TAKE THE OIL. KEEP THE OIL. TO THE VICTORS GO THE SPOILS. WE LOSE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF UNBELIEVABLE PEOPLE. WITH WOUNDED WARRIORS WHO I LOVE ALL OVER THE PLACE. LOOK AT IRAQ, BUT WE GET? NOTHING.  AND I RAN NOW TAKE SEVERAL IRAQ. I READ MADE A GREAT DEAL WITH ONE HUNDRED 50 BILLION. TWO WEEKS HE CAME TO ME, THAT DEAL IS NOTHING. THEY MADE THE REALLY GREATEST DEAL, THEY TOOK OVER IRAQ. THEY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR IRAQ FOR EVER. UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES. BUT THEY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING. BUT THEY WERE THE SAME MILITARILY. THEY FIGHT AND FIGHT AND FIGHT. 10 FEET RIGHT, 10 FEET LEFT, LEFT, REST. THEN SADDAM HUSSEIN WOULD DROP  GAS, PEOPLE WOULD SAY IT WAS UNFAIR AND TO STOP. THIS WENT ON FOREVER.  AND IT WOULD OF GONE ON FOREVER. SO WHAT DID WE GIVE IRAN? WE GIVE THEM 100 AND -- $150 BILLION. THEY DON'T HAVE TO DEVELOP WEAPONS ANYMORE, THEY CAN BUY THEM THEY HAVE SO MUCH MONEY. HOW ABOUT THIS? WE SEE SOMETHING WRONG ALWAYS THINK SOMETHING IS WRONG, SO WE  HAVE TO WAIT 24 DAYS BEFORE WE  GO IN. BUT BEFORE THE 24 DAYS START,  THERE IS A WHOLE PROCEDURE.  SO WHO KNOWS HOW LONG IT COULD TAKE. IT COULD BE SIX MONTHS. IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS, IT IS CALLED SELF-INSPECTION.  THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO  SELF-INSPECT. SO WE CALL UPON WE SAY, LISTEN, WE HEAR YOU ARE BUILDING A NUCLEAR WEAPON. AND THEY SAY, OH NO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY.  WE WILL SELF-INSPECT. WE SAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE IT NOW WE FEEL MUCH  BETTER. THESE ARE THE DEALS WE MAKE. SERGEANT BERGDAHL? ANYONE EVER YOUR SERGEANT BERGDAHL? YOU GET SERGEANT BERGDAHL, A DIRTY ROTTEN TRAITOR. SIX PEOPLE DIED GOING AFTER SERGEANT BERGDAHL. WE GET BERGDAHL, THEY GET FIVE OF THE GREAT KILLERS THAT THEY  HAVE WANTED FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS. THE PEOPLE THEY WANTED, SO WE  KNEW HE WAS A TRAITOR. WHO WOULD MAKE DEALS LIKE THIS? WHO DOES THIS RUSSIAN MARK OBAMA. -- DOES THIS? OBAMA.   OBAMA IS A DISASTER. TAKE A LOOK AT OUR TRADE DEALS. WE'RE GOING TO LOSE $500 BILLION, TRADE DEFICITS OF WITH CHINA. WITH JAPAN, 100 BILLION DOLLARS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE YEAR. HAD YOU HAVE A COUNTRY, THEY SAY, WILL TRUMP DOES NOT BELIEVE  IN FAIR TRADE. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY, AT LEAST WE'RE BREAKING EVEN. HOW DO YOU LOSE THOSE KINDS OF NUMBERS? I LOVE CHINA, BY THE WAY. IDEAL TREMENDOUSLY WITH CHINA. I WILL A GOOD DEAL OF A BUILDING IN SAN FRANCISCO OR CHINA. I OWN CONDOS THROUGH CHINA. I DO BUSINESS WITH CHINA. IN FACT, MY DAUGHTER IS HERE. AS OF AUGUST? STAND UP, OF OREGON. -- IN FACT MY DAUGHTER IS HERE. WHERE IS IVANKA? IVANKA DEALS WITH CHINA ALL THE TIME. I HAVE THOUSANDS OF DEALS WITH CHINA, MEXICO, HISPANIC PEOPLE.  THAT THERE LEADERS ARE TWO CUNNING FOR OUR LEADERS. LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THE BISCOE, FROM CHICAGO, FOLKS. NA-- NABISCO, FROM CHICAGO, FOLKS. I AM GOING TO SAY, STOP THIS. WE'RE LOSING OUR MANUFACTURING JOBS. I GO TO VERY GOOD COLLEGES AND I SEE STUDENTS AND THEY ARE BORROWED UP TO THE NECK. EVERYTHING. THE BIGGEST ALBUM IS, THEY GRADUATE, THE STUDY, THEY DO WELL. THEY ARE REALLY WONDERFUL, THEY'RE PROUD OF THEMSELVES. THEY COME OUT, THEY CANNOT GET A JOB. WE HAVE GOT TO CREATE JOBS. WE HAVE GOT TO BRING BACK THE JOBS FROM CHINA AND JAPAN AND ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES THAT ARE  HAS OFF. -- THAT ARE WITH US OFF. WHO WAS GOING TO BUILD THE WALL, FOLKS?  YOU TELL ME. WHO IS GOING TO BUILD THE WALL? MEXICO. EVERYBODY KNOWS. IT IS SO EASY, YOU HAVE NO IDEA. AND THE REASON IS EASY, FOR ME, I JUST BUILD A 92-STORY BUILDING. WHEN YOU BUILD BUILDINGS, BUILDING A WALL IS LIKE HITTING SOME BLANK. -- SOME PLANK. DING! BUT I HAVE GOT TO MAKE THE WALL OF YOU TO FALL. WHY? BECAUSE SOMEDAY THEY ARE GOING TO NAME THE WALL TRUMP WALL. PEOPLE CAN STILL COME IN, BUT THEY WILL COME IN LEGALLY. THEY WILL GO THROUGH A PROCESS. ONE OF THE PEOPLE I'M RUNNING AGAINST, SUCH NICE, RELIGIOUS PEOPLE, I CAN'T SAY BAD. AM I ALLOWED TO SAY BAD IN THIS ROOM?   BUT THE OTHER DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME I HEARD IT, ONE OF THE FOLKS SAID, WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A WALL. I WAS LIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON? NOBODY SAID THAT BEFORE SYSTEM OF THEY'RE ALL COMING MY WAY,   YOU KNOW. THEY'RE ALL COMING MY WAY. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN. THEY WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE TO   BEGIN. THEY'D -- IT WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE WALLS, NOT ONE OF THESE   WALLS. IF YOU GOT UP THERE, YOU'D BE REALLY SCARED COMING DOWN. WE CAN DO IT FOR THE RIGHT PRICE.  I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW  ""SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE,"" WHERE THEY SAID, THE WALL, BUT JUST SO  YOU UNDERSTAND, THE REASON THEY'RE GOING TO PAY AND THE REASON IT'S EASY FOR A BUSINESSMAN TO UNDERSTAND THIS, MEXICO IS MAKING A FORTUNE ON THE UNITED STATES. NOW, CHINA, I LOVE THEM. THEY'RE GREAT. I'M NOT HOLING IT AGAINST CHINA. THE LARGEST BANK IN THE WORLD IS  A CHINESE BANK A TENANT OF MINE.  I DON'T HOLD THAT AGAINST THEM. MEXICO, I DON'T HOLD IT AGAINST MEXICO. YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE CRIME AND ALL, I DON'T HOLD THAT AGAINST MEXICO. IF THEIR POLITICIANS CAN DO IT, I HOLD IT AGAINST OUR VERY STUPID LEADERSHIP IN THIS   COUNTRY. I DON'T HOLD IT AGAINST THESE   OTHER COUNTRIES.  I MEAN IF THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH  IT, LET THEM DO IT.   I WANT TO GET AWAY WITH THINGS.   I COULD GO INTO STORY AFTER STORY AFTER STORY AND I USED TO USE THE WORD INCOMPETENCE. BUT IT'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH. YOU KNOW? I USED THIS EOTHER WORD, YOU KNOW THE WORD I TALK ABOUT, I   USE THE OTHER WORD AND THEY SAY, HE'S PLAIN SPOKEN.  I WROTE ""THE ART OF THE DEAL"" AND MANY BEST SELLERS.  WHO HAS READ ""THE ART OF THE   DEAL,""? I ALWAYS SAY A DEEP, DEEP SECOND TO THE BIBLE. THE BIBLE IS THE BEST. THE BIBLE BLOWS IT AWAY, NOTHING LIKE THE BIBLE.   BUT ""THE ART OF THE DEAL,"" IN FACT, THERE'S A FEW OF THEM OVER THERE.  BUT ""THE ART OF THE DEAL"" WAS THE BEST-SELLING BUSINESS BOOK. OBAMA DIDN'T READ IT. KERRY DIDN'T READ IT.   WE CAN ALWAYS DO SOMETHING WITH OUR COUNTRY. I ALWAYS USED THE WORD INCORP. TENT.   I'M NOT BEING FUNDED BY GUYS FROM WALL STREET THAT -- I'M SELF-FINANCING MY OWN CAMPAIGN. I'M NOT TAKING FUNDS. IS THAT NICE? SO WE CAN DO WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY. IN OTHER WORDS, WE ARE GOING TO DO WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY. AND I TELL PEOPLE ALL THE TIME, AND USE FORD AS AN EXAMPLE, YOU COULD USE NABISCO AND OTHER COUNTRIES. YOU'RE GOING -- YOU'VE GOT A LOT  OF INVERSION GOING ON, COMPANIES LEAVING THE U.S. BECAUSE TAXES ARE TOO HIGH. THEY'RE LEAVING, IT'S CALLED CORPORATE INVERSION. IT'S A DISASTER. THEY'RE LEAVING FOR LOWER TAXES OR BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BRING THEIR $2.5 TRILLION BACK INTO   THE COUNTRY. THEY CAN'T DO IT. BUT TAKE FORD, I USE THIS AS AN   EXAMPLE. IT COULD BE ANYBODY. ANY COMPANY THAT GO INTO OTHER   COUNTRIES. BUT TAKE FORD. $2.5 MILLION. THEY'VE TAKEN A LOT OF STUFF OUT OF MICHIGAN. THEY'RE CLOSING OTHER THINGS. THEY'RE GOING TO BUILD THIS MASSIVE THING, HEARD $2.5   BILLION FOR ONE PLACE, THEY'RE   GOING TO MAKE CARS, TRUCKS AND   PARTS. THE PRESIDENT OFFORD WROTE ME A LETTER TELLING ME IT'S A GOOD   THICK, IT'S NOT. GOOD COMPANY, RUN VERY WELL, GOOD PRODUCT. I LOVE FORD, I LOVE CHEVROLET, I LOVE ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE WANT TO BUY U.S.A., RIGHT? BUT THEY WROTE ME, AND I SAID, THE STORY.  LET'S SAY A STIFF LIKE JEB BUSH   IS PRESIDENT.   LET'S SAY JEB BUSH IS PRESIDENT. OK.   LOW NRBLING PERSON BUT THAT'S OK.   LET'S SAY JEB BECOMES PRESIDENT. JEB IS FUN. THEY'LL GO TO HIM HE HAS $128 MILLION HE GOT FROM DOE NO, SIR, SPECIAL INTERESTS, EVERYBODY. LOBBYISTS.  SO FORD WILL HIRE ONE OF THE   LOBBYISTS, THEY'LL -- LOOK, I KNOW THIS GAME BETTER THAN   ANYBODY. I'VE BEEN PLYING THIS GAME FOR A LONG TIME. I CHANGED SIDES. I WAS TOTAL ESTABLISHMENT. NOW I'M LIKE THE WORST THING   THAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE   ESTABLISHMENT BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE GAME.  SO NOW THEY GO TO, LET'S SAY JEB, THEY SAY, MR. PRESIDENT,   THIS IS A BAD THING. I AGREE IT'S BAD, I AGREE IT'S   BAD. WE CAN'T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. HE'LL GET A CALL FROM LOBBYISTS OR SPECIAL INTERESTS.   MR. PRESIDENT, THEY GAVE YOU $5 MILLION. YOU CAN'T NOT MAKE THIS DEAL. DID THEY? ANOTHER ONE WILL CALL, MR. PRESIDENT, THEY GAVE YOU $2 MILLION, YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OFFORD. OK, I'LL DO IT. WE LOSE THE JOBS, WE LOSE ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS.   WITH ME, THEY'RE GOING TO CALL. HILLARY, JUST AS BAD, EVEN   WORSE. HILLARY, THEY'LL CALL, THEY'RE GOING TO CALL HILLARY AND THEY'RE GOING TO SAY, MADAM   PRESIDENT, BY THE WAY, I WANT TO SEE A WOMAN PRESIDENT SOON BUT NOT HER. SHE'S A DISASTER. SHE'S A DISASTER. SHE'S A DISASTER.    . AND JUST THINK OF THE CORRUPTION  AND THE SCANDAL.  WE DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH IT.   YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH IT.  WE WANT TO SEE WINNING. WIN, WIN, WIN.  I ALWAYS JOKE, I SAY, WE WANT TO  SEE WIN, WIN, WIN, CONSTANT   WINNING, AND YOU'LL SAY IF I'M PRESIDENT, YOU'LL SAY, PLEASE,   MR. PRESIDENT, WE'RE WINNING TOO MUCH, WE CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE, CAN'T WE HAVE A LOSS?   AND I'LL SAY, NO, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP WIN, WINNING, WINNING, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AND YOU'LL SAY OK, MR. PRESIDENT. OK.   BUT THEY'LL CALL HILLARY WITH   FORD, RIGHT?  THEY'LL CALL HILLARY. AND THEY'LL SAY, MADAM PRESIDENT.  SHE'LL DO THE SAME THING. BECAUSE HER DONORS GAVE HER A LOT OF MONEY AND THEY NEED MONEY  FOR THE NEXT ELECTION. BY THE WAY, THE ONLY TIME POLITICIANS REALLY WORK RIGHT IS WHEN THEY'RE SORT OF LIKE RETIRING.   LIKE THE GENTLEMAN OVER THERE, THE CONGRESSMAN.  HE'S A YOUNG GUY.   HE RETIRED OF HIS OWN VOLITION   BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON  IN WASHINGTON, WHICH I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR. SOME OF THEM RETIRE AND GET A LITTLE TOUGHER. WITH FORD, YOU TAKE A LOOK. THEY CALL THEM, NOW IT'S PRESIDENT TRUMP. SO     SO THEY CALL PRESIDENT TRUMP AND  SAY, MR. PRESIDENT. YOU HAVE TO DO THIS. FORD HAS BEEN GREAT AND WONDERFUL.  WHAT ARE THEY BUILDING IN MEXICO  FOR? THEY'RE GOING TO BUILD. REMEMBER THIS, CARS, TRUCKS, AND PARTS, THEY'RE GOING TO SELL THEM ACROSS THE BORDER, NO TAX. YOU SAY, WE'RE ALL SMART PEOPLE,  HOW DOES THAT HELP US?  WE CLOSE PLANTS AND WE OPEN NEW PLANTS IN MEXICO AND THEY SELL AND THERE'S NO TAX. SO THEY'RE GOING TO SAY, NO, NO,  NO. WE'RE GOING FOR IT. I'LL SAY IF YOU GO FORWARD,   THAT'S FINE.  BUT FOR EVERY CAR, TRUCK, AND   WHATEVER ELSE YOU'RE BUILDING, YOU ARE GOING TO PAY A 35% TAX EVERY TIME IT CROSSES THE BORDER.   WE HAVE TO.   OR WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A   COUNTRY LEFT. EVERYONE IS RIPPING US. EVERYONE IS RIPPING US. I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE   I'M A FREE TRADER, I WANT FREE TRADE. BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE SMART HERE, FOLKS. WE'VE LOST SEVEN, EIGHT, SOME PEOPLE SAY 10 MILLION JOBS,   WE'VE LOST 50,000 MANUFACTURING   PLANTS, WE'RE GETTING KILLED. AND THE QUALITY OF OUR JOBS IS   TERRIBLE. YOU SAW THAT IN THE LAST REPORT.  THEY HAVE THIS PHONY NUMBER,   5.2%. EVERYBODY THAT QUITS LOOKING FOR A JOB IS CONSIDERED STATISTICALLY A PERSON THAT HAS A JOB.  IT'S A PHONY NUMBER.  YOUR PROBABLE REAL NUMBER IS LIKE 22%, 23%. IF YOU LOOK AT CROWDS LIKE THIS, IF WE WERE AT 5%, 5.2%, NOBODY WOULD BE THERE.   ALTHOUGH THEY MIGHT BE THERE BECAUSE THE MILITARY IS SO BADLY RUN WITH THIS PRESIDENT. PROBABLY THERE FOR OTHER REASONS.  BASICALLY, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE KIND OF CROWDS AND THE KIND OF POLL NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE. SO I'LL TELL FORD THE FOLLOWING. LOOK.   GOT TO MOVE YOUR PLANT BACK. THEY'LL CALL ME, HAVE A FEW PEOPLE CALL ME, DOESN'T MATTER,   THEY DIDN'T GIVE ME ANY MONEY. JERRY WAS RIGHT. THEY DON'T OWN ME. SELF-FUND THEY DON'T OWN ME. I'LL SAY, LOOK, MR. PRESIDENT OFFORD, I'M SORRY, YOU'VE GOT TO BUILD HERE OR WE'RE CHARGING YOU A TAX. I'LL SAY, THINK ABOUT IT OVERNIGHT, HE'LL CALL ME BACK   THE NEXT DAY, I GUARANTEE YOU, 100%, HE'LL SAY, MR. PRESIDENT, WE HAVE DECIDED TO BUILD A PLANT IN THE UNITED STATES. OK, THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN.  IT HAS TO HAPPEN.   IT HAS TO HAPPEN. FREE TRADE IS GOOD BUT WE HAVE TO BE SMART ABOUT IT.   OR WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A   COUNTRY LEFT. SO WHEN THIS STARTED, AND I CALL  IT A JOURNEY, ON JUNE 16, THE   ESCALATOR, HAS EVERYONE SEEN THE  FAMOUS ESCALATOR?   I WAS COMING DOWN TO REPORTERS, IT WAS LIKE THE ACADEMY AWARDS,   I'D NEVER SEEN SO MANY CAMERAS IN MY RIFE. JERRY SAID, IT'S VERY HARD FOR SOMEBODY TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. VERY HARD FOR SOMEBODY THAT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL, I'VE HEARD THIS ALL MY LIFE, TO GO INTO POLITICS, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE   GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.   YOU'RE EXPOSING SO MUCH. YOU'RE DOING DEALS AND DEALS,   PLUS YOU DON'T DO THIS. WHO WOULD HAVE KNOWN I WAS GOING TO DO THIS. I LOVE DOING DEBATES, I NEVER DEBATED BEFORE. POLITICIAN DECISIONS DO IT ALL THE TIME, THEY'RE ALL TALK NO ACTION. ON TOP OF THEM MOST OF -- ON TOP  OF THAT, MOST OF THEM ARE NOT EVEN GOOD DEBATERS.   YOU'D THINK THEY COULD DEBATE   PROPERLY. SOME OF THE THINGS THEY SAY IS INCREDIBLE. BUT WE'RE COMING DOWN THE ESCALATOR AND I SAID TO MY WIFE,  OK. WE HAVE TO DO IT.   I'VE JUST SEEN SO MANY STUPID THINGS.   I SAY WE HAVE TO DO IT. WE'VE GOT TO GO AND WE'VE GOT TO DO IT.  AND SHE SAID IF YOU WANT TO DO   IT, I'M WITH YOU 100%. SHE'S BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE. AND I GOT ON, THANK YOU, I GOT ON THE ESCALATOR AND WE'RE GOING DOWN, I'M WAVING, AND I'M SAYING WOW, AND I WENT UP AND STARTED TALKING ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. AND BOY, DID I TAKE IT. FOR TWO WEEKS, RUSH LIMBAUGH SAID THE MOST HE'S EVER SEEN A   HUMAN BEING TAKE. WHEN I SPEAK ABOUT SUCCESS, A   LOT OF PEOPLE ASKED ME TO -- ASK ME TO SPEAK ABOUT SUCCESS, I   LOVE SPEAKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE I CAN HELP PEOPLE. ONE OF THE THINGS IS, YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE WHAT YOU DO BUT YOU CAN NEVER, THIS APPLIES TO SO MANY YOUNG, INCREDIBLE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, YOU CAN NEVER, EVER GIVE UP. YOU CAN NEVER GIVE UP. IF YOU GIVE UP, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. I'VE SEEN PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS, I WENT TO WHARTON AND I KNOW   PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN PHENOMENAL , BUT THEY ZRNT THAT DRIVE, THAT STICK TO ITIVENESS, THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT OVER GUYS THAT ARE NOT AS GOOD, NOT AS SMART BUT THEY HAD THE DRIVE. SO YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO NEVER, EVER QUIT OR GIVE UP. SO I SAID. SO IMPORTANT.   I FIGURED I'D GET OUT OF   POLITICS FOR AT LEAST TWO SENTENCES. BUT IT'S SO TRUE. JUST DON'T QUIT. AND FOR YOU, ALWAYS, ALWAYS GO INTO A FIELD YOU LOVE. YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE IT. IF YOU DON'T LOVE IT, YOU'RE NOT GOING TORE SUCCESSFUL. EVEN IF PEOPLE SAY, OH, YOU SHOULD, YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE IT. IF YOU DON'T LOVE WHAT YOU DO,   YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL.   THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. I MAKE YOU PROUD TO BE AN   AMERICAN. STAND UP.   AND DO -- DID I EVER MEET YOU   BEFORE? NO.   THAT'S VERY NICE. THANK YOU, MAN, THANK YOU. BUT WE MEAN THAT. WE MEAN IT. VERY NICE.  SO, I TOOK A LOT OF INCOMING AS RUSH SAID, HE'S A GREAT GUY, TREMENDOUS INCOMING. AND I STUCK. AND I EVEN DOUBLED DOWN. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAD TREMENDOUS STATS COMING OUT   WHICH WERE TERRIBLE BUT TREMENDOUS NUMBERS. AND YOU SAW THE KIND OF CRIME AND YOU SAW THE THE WOMAN IN LOS ANGELES WHO WAS RAPED, SODOMIZED AND KILLED BY AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT YOU SAW THE KIND OF   HORROR GOING ON, NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF BORDER, NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF COMING IN, NOT ONLY IN   TERMS OF DRUGS POURING ACROSS DRUGS WHICH ARE YOING GO RR ARE   GOING TO RUIN THE FABRIC OF OUR COUNTRY, COMING ACROSS THE BORDER BUT IN TERMS OF THE SHEER VOLUME. PEOPLE STARTED TO SAY, YOU KNOW,  TRUMP IS RIGHT. IF I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IMLEGAL  -- ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IN MY OPENING REMARKS, I DON'T THINK YOU'D BE TALKING ABOUT IT TODAY AND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ANYBODY IS   TALKING ABOUT. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS. SO WHEN IT STARTED OUT, I   STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT THINGS. COMMON CORE, VERY BAD. GOT TO EDUCATE YOUR CHILDREN   LOCALLY. VERY BAD.   SECOND AMENDMENT, VERY GOOD.  WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROTECT OURSELVES. VERY GOOD. WHEN WE HAVE PEOPLE, THE WHOLE GUN SITUATION IS UNDER SIEGE, NOW THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WE WANT TO GIVE LESS BULLETS, TAKE   BULLETS AWAY, THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN. BY THE WAY IN PARIS, WHICH HAS   PROBABLY THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE WORLD, AND FRANCE, HAD BULLETS BEEN GOING THE OTHER WAY YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD 130 PEOPLE KILLED AND PLENTY MORE TO FOLLOW WHO WERE SO BADLY INJURED.  IN CALIFORNIA, RECENTLY, TWO   WEEKS AGO, WHERE YOU HAD THE 14   PEOPLE KILLED AND OTHERS TO   FOLLOW BECAUSE OF THE TREMENDOUS  INJURIES, BUT THEN YOU HAD THE   14 BY THESE TWO RADICALIZED PEOPLE.   THE PEOPLE THAT WERE KILLED GAI   THEM WEDDING PARTIES. THEY HELD WEDDING PARTY, THEY   KNEW THEM, THEY WERE FRIENDS.   THEY WENT IN AND KILLED 4 PEOPLE.   IF WE HAD A COUPLE OF GUYS LIKE HIM OR HIM OR DEFINITELY HIM   WITH THE WHITE HAT ON, WITH A GUN STRAPPED AND THE BULLETS WOULD GO THE OTHER WAY, YOU   WOULD HAVE HAD PROBLEMS, YOU   WOULDN'T HAVE HAD IT TO THE SAME EXTENT AT ALL. WE NEED THE SECOND AMENDMENT, DON'T LET ANYBODY TAKE IT AWAY. IF I GET ELECTED, IT'S TOTALLY PROTECTED.  TOTALLY PROTECTED. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING AND THESE ARE THE THINGS I TALKED ABOUT.  WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT SUPER P.A.C.S. SUPER P.A.C.S ARE NOW RUNNING THE COUNTRY. THEY'RE RUNNING OUR POLITICIANS AND OUR POLITICIANS AREN'T DOING  WHAT'S RIGHT FOR ALL OF US. WE'VE GOT TO GET RID OF THE SUPER P.A.C.S. WE WANT TO HAVE AN IDEA OF WHO'S WHAT'S BEING PUT UP AND WHO IS DOING IT, GOT TO GET RID OF THE SUPER P.A.C.S. WITH PARIS, PRETTY MUCH THE START OF PARIS, ALL OF A SUDDEN PARIS HAPPENS AND MY POLL NUMBERS WENT WAY UP AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? THEN CNN DID A BIG POLL AND A BIG STUDY AND THEY SAID, TRUMP IS NUMBER ONE BY FAR ON THE MILITARY.   BY FAR ON PROTECTION.   BY FAR ON THE BORDER. BY FAR ON ISIS. BECAUSE THEY SEE ME, BECAUSE OF MY VERY STRONG STANCE ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, IT'S AN OFFSHOOT, I  WON'T LET THE SYRIANS THAT WE   HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE, THEY WANT TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY, THEY MAY BE ISIS, IT MAY BE THE GREAT TROJAN HORSE OF ALL TIME. WHO KNOWS. WE CANNOT TAKE A CHANCE. I WANT TO BUILD A SAFE ZONE, SOME PLACE IN SYRIA, BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN GERMANY IS A DISASTER.   WHAT'S HAPPENING IN BRUSSELS, YOU LOOK, WHAT'S HAPPENING ALL   OVER EUROPE. EUROPE IS BEING ABSOLUTELY   SWAMPED AND DESTROYED. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE CRIME AND THE PROBLEMS. AND IT COULD BE SOME SINISTER   PLOT. YOU LOOK AT THESE MIGRATION YOU LOOK AT THE LINES AND YOU LOOK AT THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF YOUNG, STRONG MEN IN THOSE LINES.  AND YOU SAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?   OBAMA WANTS TO TAKE IN THOUSANDS  AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. WE CAN'T DO IT FOLKS.   WE CAN'T DO IT.   WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE. WE'RE GOING TO DO A FREE ZONE AND A SAFE ZONE, WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING WHERE WE HAVE TO GET THE GULF STATES, THEY HAVE   NOTHING BUT MONEY, GOT TO GET THEM TO FUND IT, GOT TO GET THEM TO PUT UP THE MONEY.  WITHOUT US, THEY WOULDN'T BE THERE VERY LONG. WE PROTECT THEM. WITH THE MILITARY, BY THE WAY, WE'RE PROTECTING COUNTRIES THAT ARE BEHEMOTHS. WE'RE PROTECTING COUNTRIES THAT   ARE SO RICH SO POWERFUL SO   INCREDIBLE, SOUTH KOREA, WE PROTECT SOUTH KOREA.  I HAVE MANY FRIENDS THAT HAVE BUILDINGS IN SOUTH KOREA, BUT WE'RE PROTECTING SOUTH KOREA WITH 28,000 SOLDIERS IN THE LINE.   BETWEEN THE MANIAC AND SOUTH KOREA. WE'RE PROTECTING THEM.  THEY PAY US PEANUTS. WE PR PROTECT GERMANY, WE PROTECT JAPAN, WE PROTECT   COUNTRIES NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT. BEFORE THE OIL PRICE WENT DOWN SAUDI ARABIA WAS MAKING $1 BILLION A DAY. WE PROTECT THEM.  THEY PAY US LIKE PRACTICALLY NOTHING COMPARED TO THE COST. THEY'VE GOT TO PAY UP. THEY'VE GOT TO PAY UP. EVERYBODY HAS TO PAY UP. WE CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.   WE'VE GOT TO RUN IT LIKE A BUSINESS BUT WITH HEART. WE'RE GOING TO CREATE GREAT   HEALTH CARE, GET RID OF OBAMACARE, GOING TO TERMINATE   IT. WE'RE GOING TO REPEAL IT AND REPLACE IT. AND NOW YOU SEE THE SIGNS, THE STOCK MARKET IS STARTING TO GO DOWN, A LOT OF BAD THINGS.  I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS.  WE'RE RIDING A BIG, FAT JUICY   BUBBLE. GIVING OUT LOANS FOR NOTHING.   YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING   WITH OUR MONEY. YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE.   SO WE'RE RIDING A BUBBLE. IT COULD BE REALLY UGLY.  BUT RIGHT NOW YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE AT LEAST THE BEGINNING SIGNS  OF IT BECAUSE THE STOCK MARKET, WHICH WAS THE ONLY INDICATOR THAT THINGS WERE GOOD IS STARTING TO GO DOWN.  WHAT'S HAPPENING IS, WITH PARIS, I TOOK A DIFFERENT TURN.  NOW I'M BACK AND REALLY BACK TO   SECURITY AND SECURITY FOR OUR COUNTRY AND GREAT, GREAT MILITARY. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD THAT   MILITARY. GREAT, GREAT MILITARY. AND PEOPLE ARE LOVING IT AND PEOPLE NEED IT AND THEY DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE POLITICIANS AND THEY DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE ESSENTIALLY IN THE OTHER CANDIDATES. WHEN YOU'RE LEADING BY THE KIND OF NUMBERS I'M LEADING BY, THEY DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE OTHER CANDIDATES. BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND POLITICIANS.  WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH POLITICIANS FOR THE LAST SO MANY  YEARS, WE'RE SO TIRED OF DEALING  WITH THESE PEOPLE, THEY'RE NO GOOD FOR WHAT WE HAVE.  SO WE'RE GOING TO DO THINGS THAT  CAN BE DONE.  WE'RE GOING TO FIX OUR MILITARY. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS WHO ARE THE GREATEST PEOPLE, MOST INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. THEY'RE TREATED HORRIBLY. I MEAN, OUR VETS, OUR VETS ARE   TREATED WORSE THAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN MANY CASES. YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. OUR VETS ARE NOT BEING TREATED PROPERLY. WE'RE SPENDING TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY. THE CORRUPTION IN THE V.A. ADMINISTRATION AND THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION IS BEYOND BELIEF. WE'RE GOING TO FIX THE SITUATION SO OUR VETS ARE TAKEN CARE OF THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF. WE'RE GOING TO DO ALL OF THESE THINGS AND WE'RE GOING TO CREATE  SECURITY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GREAT SECURITY. SO IN A NUTSHELL, NUMBER ONE,   IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE AGAIN.   IT'S AN HONOR IN TERMS OF MARTIN LUTHER KING TO HAVE BROKEN THE RECORD WORK DEDICATING THE RECORD TO THE LATE, GREAT,   MARTIN LUTHER KING. BUT IT'S AN HONOR. AND VERY SIMPLY, AND I DIDN'T USED TO SAY THIS, TWO OR THREE WEEKS AGO I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BUT I THINK I CAN SAY IT NOW BECAUSE I'VE SEEN SO MANY PEOPLE, WE HAVE SUCH AMAZING   PEOPLE, SHARP, SMART, ENERGETIC, THEY'RE AMAZING.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A LITTLE COLD, BUT WE WILL TAKE IT. BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU EVERYBODY. WE'VE HAD SO MUCH FUN. I LOVE IOWA. THE POLLS SAID WE ARE EVEN. YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHERE I AM EVEN. WE ARE WINNING EVERY NATIONAL POLL, EVERY STATE CALL. WE DON'T WANT EVEN. EVEN IS NO GOOD. I HAVE A FEELING WE ARE GOING TO SURPRISE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON FEBRUARY 1. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SURPRISED. I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT ABOUT IT. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I KNOW IT IS COLD AND YOU HAVE A RECORD CROWD. WE HAVE BIG CROWDS. USUALLY PEOPLE ARE SITTING. THEY GOT RID OF ALL THE SEATS SO THAT WE COULD GET MORE PEOPLE IN. OUR COUNTRY IS IN TROUBLE, VERY THANK YOU. SERIOUS TROUBLE. NO MATTER WHAT ASPECT OF OUR COUNTRY YOU LOOK AT, WHETHER IT IS THE MILITARY WHICH IS NOT PREPARED, A GENERAL WHEN HE LEFT SAID IN TERMS OF PREPAREDNESS WE ARE THE WORST WE HAVE BEEN. I THINK HE SAID SINCE INCEPTION. LET'S TAKE IT BACK TO WORLD WAR II OR WORLD WAR I. WE CAN'T DO THAT. WE NEED STRENGTHEN OUR MILITARY. I'M GOING TO BUILD OUR MILITARY BIGGER AND BETTER AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. BIGGER AND BETTER AND STRONGER. HOPEFULLY NOBODY IS GOING TO MESS WITH US AND BY DOING THAT , IN MANY WAYS THAT IS THE CHEAPEST THING YOU CAN DO. INSTEAD OF ENDING IN THESE PROTRACTED WARS. I SEE THESE GENERALS SO OFTEN. THEY ARE ALWAYS BEEN INTERVIEWED ON TELEVISION. DO YOU THINK GENERAL MACARTHUR IS A BIG INTERVIEWER? DO YOU THINK GENERAL PATTON WENT ON TELEVISION? THEY GET INTERVIEWED. THEY SAY WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO, HOW WE ARE GOING TO DO IT. I SAW ONE OF THE GENERALS RECENTLY, NICE GUY, NICE GUY, AND HE IS SAYING HOW TOUGH ISIS IS. THEY ARE VERY TOUGH. HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO IT? I DON'T KNOW. THEY ARE VERY TOUGH. CAN YOU IMAGINE THE ENEMY IS WATCHING THIS. THEY ARE SAYING IS THIS WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING? IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE, FOLKS. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE TOUGHEST, SMARTEST PEOPLE. WE WILL HAVE SECURITY IN OUR COUNTRY. BY THE WAY, I NEVER MENTION THE MILITARY WITHOUT MENTIONING THE FACT THAT OUR VETS ARE GOING TO BE TREATED GREAT. THEY ARE GOING TO BE TREATED GREAT. THEY'RE NOT TREATED RIGHT. WE HAVE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TREATED BETTER IN MANY CASES.  IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE. THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION IS A MESS. IT IS CORRUPT, IT IS RUN POORLY. OUR VETERANS ARE GOING TO BE TREATED WELL. PUT IT DOWN AND GUARANTEE IT. IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. ONE OTHER THING I HAVE TO SAY, THERE HAS BEEN TALK THAT I WAS GOING TO GO IN THE BACK OF THE PACK. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT TRADITION. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT PUTTING IOWA -- THEN YOU WON'T SEE ME AS MUCH. THAT WILL BE TERRIBLE. AND I WILL NOT SEE YOU. IT IS NOT THE SAME THING. IOWA WILL REMAIN WHERE IT IS. YOU CAN BANK ON IT. YOU CAN BANK ON IT. THE POLLS CAME OUT LAST NIGHT. FOX CAME OUT WITH A BIG HOLE. POLL. WE DID GREAT. WE HAVE BEEN DOING GOOD FROM THE BEGINNING. MY WIFE SAID IF YOU RUN YOU ARE GOING TO WIN. NICE HAVE A WIFE WHO FEELS LIKE THAT. DO ME A FAVOR, DARLING. DON'T DO IT. SHE SAID IF YOU RUN YOUR GOING TO WIN. FROM THE BEGINNING WE ANNOUNCED JUNE 16. ALMOST FROM THAT WEEK WE ARE LIKE A ROCKET SHIP. THESE CHARACTERS, THESE PRESSED SOME THE MOST DISHONEST PEOPLE , IN THE WORLD. LOOK AT THEM. WAVE TO THEM. SOME OF THE MOST DISHONEST -- SOME OF THE MOST SERIOUSLY DISHONEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, IT DOESN'T MATTER. I HAVE TO SAY, 25% ARE GOOD. ACTUALLY, THE NUMBER IS GETTING UP. TIME MAGAZINE WROTE A COVER STORY ON ME. YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY TIME MAGAZINE. I DON'T SAY THIS VERY OFTEN. THEY WROTE A COVER STORY. I GOT A COUPLE OF COVERS. THEY SAID I SHOULD HAVE ONE PERSON OF THE YEAR. THEY GAVE IT TO CHANCELLOR MERKEL, WHO HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS. THAT WAS NOT A GOOD MOVE MADE IN GERMANY. I WANT TO TELL YOU. ALL THE PUNDITS WERE SAYING, TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN. TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN. I SAID, NO WON'T. , I'M NOT ESTABLISHMENT. THEY DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO GIVE IT TO ME. I WAS RIGHT. THAT'S OK. THEY WROTE A STORY BEFORE THAT. THAT WAS OK. THIS STORY IS SO WELL WRITTEN, I NEVER SPOKE TO THE WRITER. HE JUST TOOK THE CAMPAIGN, NO MATTER WHERE I GO, DALLAS, 21,000 IN DALLAS. PACK. ED. WE GO TO ALABAMA, 35,000 PEOPLE. WE GO TO OKLAHOMA, 20,000 PEOPLE STANDING IN A FIELD. A CONVENTION CENTER THAT HELD 10,000 PEOPLE. AFTER A DAY, WE SAID THIS ISN'T WORKING. WE TOOK A FIELD. IT WAS VERY WINDY SO I PUT A HAT ON. NO MATTER WHERE WE GO. THEN IN IOWA WE ALWAYS HAVE THE , BIGGEST CROWDS. THEY WERE SAYING AT OUR LAST VENUE, I JUST LEFT ANOTHER PLACE. YOU KNOW WHERE I LEFT. WHERE DID I LEAVE? CORRECT. ONE OF OUR TOP COMPETITORS WAS THERE. THEY HAD 1/5 THE CROWD WE HAD. NO MATTER WHO YOU GET, IT IS A MOVEMENT. WHAT WE ARE DOING IS A MOVEMENT. IT IS CALLED MAKE AMERICA GREAT. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. WE HAVE A CHANCE WITH WHAT WE HAVE GOING, WITH HOW GREAT THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE, TO MAKE IT MAY BE GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE AND I MEAN IT. ,AND I MEAN IT. AND I MEAN IT 100%.   IT IS EXCITING. IT IS EXCITING TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. THE CROWDS AND THE LOVE. I TELL THE STORY, MY FRIEND, ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE. HE SAID YOU ARE SPEAKING TONIGHT IN FRONT OF A DIFFERENT AREA, 20,000 PEOPLE. YOU SAW LOLA, LOWELL, MASSACHUSETTS. WE HAD 14 OR 15. YOU ARE FROM THERE? SHE FOLLOWED US HERE. THAT'S AMAZING. BUT WE DID SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. IT IS TOO BIG. IT WAS PACKED. THEY SENT AWAY 5000 TO 6000 PEOPLE. MY FRIEND SAID TO ME HOW DO YOU DO THAT? YOU HAVE ALL THOSE PEOPLE. I INSIST ON NOT USING A TELEPROMPTER. HONESTLY IT WOULD BE SO EASY. , LIKE OUR PRESIDENT. HE READS. CAN YOU RUN A LITTLE FASTER? IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE IN IOWA TODAY. GOODBYE EVERYBODY. THAT'S THE END, AND EVERYONE SAYS, THAT WAS FUN. I WOULD LOVE TO DO IT. I WOULD LOVE TO READ A SPEECH WERE YOU TAKE A SPEECH AND YOU READ IT AND THEN YOU LEAVE. RIGHT? I TOLD THIS PERSON WHEN YOU DO THAT, NUMBER ONE AFTER A LITTLE WHILE -- WORD-OF-MOUTH ON BROADWAY. EVERYONE KNOWS BROADWAY? THE BIGGEST THING ON BROADWAY, AS GREAT AS REVIEW WOULD BE IN THE NEAR TIMES OF POTENTIAL, HISTORY AND WORD-OF-MOUTH. THE WORD-OF-MOUTH FOR US HAS BEEN AMAZING. IT'S ME, BUT IT IS YOU. THE WORD-OF-MOUTH ON THESE RALLIES HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE AND THEY HAVE JUST GROWN AND GROWN. THE ONLY THING THAT STOPS THEM , INCLUDING TODAY IS THE SIZE OF , THE ARENA OR THE PLACE OR THE ROOM, WHEREVER WE ARE. IT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON. WE HAVEN'T HAD A NON-PACKED HOUSE ALMOST AT ALL. IT IS JUST INCREDIBLE. IT IS A MOVEMENT. I THINK ACTUALLY WHEN IT COMES TIME, I THINK WE ARE GOING TO ACTUALLY OVER PERFORM. I HAVE A FEELING THAT FAR MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO VOTE THAN THEY EVEN THINK AND WE ARE GOING TO SET A RECORD IN IOWA.   I HAVE TO TELL YOU, CHUCK AND SAM AND STEPHANIE AND THE WHOLE GROUP HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB, BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT ON FEBRUARY 2. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. I WAS CALLED BY A GREAT WRITER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE FROM MOST OF US, HE SAID I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU ONE QUESTION. HOW DOES IT FEEL? I SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. HE SAID, HOW DOES IT FEEL. WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. HE SAID, IT IS THE SUMMER OF TRUMP. THE ENTIRE SUMMER NOTHING LIKE , THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED IN AMERICAN POLITICS. YOU HAVE CHANGED THE DIALOGUE, EVERYTHING ABOUT RUNNING A CAMPAIGN. YOU'VE SPENT NO MONEY. YOU LOOK AT A GUY LIKE JEB BUSH. HE HAS SPENT AND HE'S AT THE $68 MILLION BOTTOM OF THE BARREL. AND HE LIKES COMMON CORE. EDUCATING CHILDREN BY BUREAUCRATS IN WASHINGTON. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, OK? BY THE WAY, BY THE WAY, AND REMEMBER WITH THE BORDER? THEY COME OVER AS AN ACT OF LOVE. REMEMBER THAT ONE? I SAID HE'S GONE. HE SPENT $69 MILLION. I SPENT NOTHING. I ALMOST FEEL GUILTY. SO WHAT HAPPENED, HE SAID TO ME, HOW DOES IT FEEL? I SAID IT DOESN'T FEEL ANYTHING. I HAVE NOT WON. HE SAID EVEN IF YOU DON'T RUN, WHAT YOU HAVE DONE HAS NEVER BEEN DONE IN POLITICS. I SAID IF I DON'T WIN I WILL CONSIDER THIS A BIG, FAT WASTE OF TIME BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING , TO BE ABLE TO MAKE OUR BORDER STRONG. POLITICIANS CAN'T DO IT. ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS RUNNING FOR OFFICE AND  AND I SAID TO HIM, AND I MEAN THAT BY THE WAY, SOME OF THESE GUYS, THEY ARE BIG PEOPLE. THEY DO A GREAT JOB WITH THEIR STATE. THEY RUN AND GET 1%. THEY LEAVE AND GET NOTHING. THEY STAY TOO LONG. THEY DON'T DO THAT. WE HAVE DONE AN AMAZING JOB. WE HAVE DONE AN AMAZING JOB. I REALLY MEAN IT. IF WE DON'T WIN I WILL NOT , CONSIDER IT SUCCESS. WE HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY. NUMBER ONE, WE HAVE TO WIN IOWA. IT IS SO MUCH EASIER IF I SAID I WANT TO DO WELL IN IOWA. IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WE ARE LEADING , BY A LOT. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY CONCEDED THAT WHEN. ANNOUNCER: I DON'T CONCEDE ANYTHING. SOUTH CAROLINA WE ARE LEADING BY 24 POINTS. IN NEVADA WE ARE LEADING BY A LOT. AND BY HISPANICS BY A LOT. I SAID THAT TO EVERYBODY. WE'RE GOING TO GET THE HISPANIC VOTE. BECAUSE I'M GOING TO TAKE OUR JOBS BACK FROM CHINA, FROM EVERYWHERE. PEOPLE KNOW THAT.   SO WE ARE LEADING BY A LOT IN NEVADA AND BY A LOT , IN THE SEC. GEORGIA. WE HAVE PLACES THAT ARE UNBELIEVABLE. THEN WE GO TO FLORIDA, AND I AM AT 32. A SITTING SENATOR, MARCO RUBIO IS AT 14. JEB BUSH WAS THEIR GOVERNOR AND HE IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TUBES. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS GUY? HE IS GETTING KILLED. I LOVE FLORIDA. IT'S A SECOND HOME FOR ME. I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PEOPLE IN FLORIDA ALSO.  AND THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR TRUMP AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BIG VICTORY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BIG VICTORY. SO WHEN I STARTED, I CAME DOWN, BEAUTIFUL BUILDING, TRUMP TOWER. GO CHECK IT OUT SOMETIME. GOTTA BUY TIME MAGAZINE FIRST, THEN CHECK OUT TRUMP TOWER. THEN LOG ON AND COME ON TO @REALDONALDTRUMP. BETWEEN TWITTER AND FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM, I HAVE LIKE 11 OR 12 MILLION FOLLOWERS, SORT OF LIKE OWNING THE NEW YORK TIMES WITHOUT THE LOSSES. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? IT'S INCREDIBLE. IT'S INCREDIBLE. I JUST -- I DID SOMETHING THE OTHER DAY. I DID A TWEET ON SOMETHING. AND I'M WATCHING. I'M HOME, TAKING IT EASY, READING THE PAPER. I DID A TWEET. AND CNN BREAKS OUT, WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS! DONALD TRUMP IS JUST -- SOME LITTLE THING ABOUT SOMEBODY NOT DOING A GOOD JOB SOMEPLACE, RIGHT? DONALD TRUMP HAS JUST ANNOUNCED THAT JEB BUSH IS LOW ENERGY.   >> SO IF YOU GO IN, IF YOU GO IN, AND YOU HAVE PARIS, WHERE YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF PLACES, AND THEY PUT THESE THUGS IN THERE WITH GUNS, THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE WORLD, THEY SAY, IS FRANCE AND PARIS. THE TOUGHEST IN THE WORLD. YOU CAN'T HAVE A GUN, UNLESS YOU'RE A BAD GUY, YOU HAVE A GUN. YOU WALK AROUND WITH A GUN, RIGHT? BUT IF YOU'RE A LAW-ABIDING PERSON, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A GUN. SO IN PARIS, THESE THUGS, THESE DIRTY ROTTEN, VERY STUPID DEMENTED PEOPLE, WALK IN. AND THEY SAY, GET OVER. BOOM! GET OVER. BOOM! NOT ONE GUN IN THE ROOM, EXCEPT FOR THE BAD GUYS. THEY KILL 130, WITH MORE TO COME BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOME REALLY BADLY WOUNDED PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITALS, MANY OF WHOM WON'T MAKE IT. YOU HAVE 130 PEOPLE, A HOSPITAL LOAD OF HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE INJURIES. FOR WHAT? I GUARANTEE YOU, IF THAT GUY RIGHT THERE HAD A GUN ON HIS ANKLE AND IF THAT GUY RIGHT THERE HAD A GUN ON HIS WAIST, AND THIS ONE OVER HERE, THE TALL ONE WITH THE GLASSES, OR EVEN THE SHORT ONE, OR THE WOMAN -- SHE LOOKS TOUGHER THAN ALL OF THEM --   IF THERE WERE GUNS ON THE OTHER SIDE, WHERE YOU'D HAVE BULLETS GOING IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, IT WOULDN'T BE THAT WAY. SAME THING IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THESE TWO HORRIBLE PEOPLE, RIGHT? THESE TWO HORRIBLE PEOPLE THAT KNEW EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM. THEY WERE SORT OF FRIENDS, I GUESS. BUT THEY KNEW EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM. AND IF YOU HAD A GUN ON THE OTHER SIDE, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FIGHT, AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE KIND OF CARNAGE AND HORROR SHOW THAT YOU HAD. WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. REMEMBER THAT. AND WITH ME, IT'S GOING TO BE PROTECTED.   AND JUST ONE OTHER THING, YOU HAVE GUN-FREE ZONES. THAT IS LIKE BAIT TO A BAD GUY. A GUN-FREE ZONE. WE HAD THE FIVE MILITARY KILLED, NOT SO LONG AGO. ON A MILITARY BASE, SIGNS ALL OVER THE PLACE, THIS IS A GUN-FREE ZONE. ONE OF THE FIVE WAS ONE OF THE ALL-TIME GREAT SOLDIERS, HAS EVERY RECORD, WAS A GREAT MARKSMAN. NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A GUN. HE CAN'T HAVE A GUN. SO THEY HAVE GUN-FREE ZONES. THE GUY SEES THIS IS A GUN-FREE ZONE. WALKS IN. KILLS THESE FIVE PEOPLE. IF THEY HAVE GUNS, BELIEVE ME, IT WASN'T TURN OUT THAT WAY. THEY WERE STANDING THERE, NOTHING THEY COULD HAVE DONE. HE WALKS IN, FULLY LOADED. THEY HAD THEIR GUNS, 200 YARDS AWAY. LOCKED UP. FIRST THING I DO, ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS -- THERE'S SO MANY THINGS TO DO, BUT WE GET RID OF THOSE GUN-FREE ZONES, ESPECIALLY ON MILITARY BASIS. IT'S RIDICULOUS. IT'S RIDICULOUS.   JUST TO FINISH, THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT OUR COUNTRY CAN DO. IT'S COMMON SENSE. IT'S SMART. WE HAVE TO BE SO VIGILANT. WE HAVE TO WATCH. WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND WHEN I BROUGHT UP A CERTAIN SUBJECT ABOUT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM, A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, I WAS MET WITH UNBELIEVABLE -- SIMILAR TO WHEN I TALKED ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. AND BY THE WAY, WHEN CNN CAME OUT WITH THEIR POLL TWO WEEKS AGO, I LEAD WITH ISIS. I LEAD WITH EVERYTHING. I LEAD WITH IMMIGRATION. I LEAD WITH ISIS. I LEAD WITH TERRORISM. AND I DON'T MEAN BY A LITTLE. I'M OVER 50% WITH MOST OF THEM. I LEAD WITH THE ECONOMY. THAT WE SORT OF EXPECT, BECAUSE I WILL BE THE GREATEST JOBS PRESIDENT THAT GOD EVER CREATED. THAT I CAN TELL YOU. THE GREATEST. I'LL BE THE BEST!  >> BUT... WHEN I BROUGHT UP -- WHEN I BROUGHT UP RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM, WORDS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES REFUSES TO SAY -- NOW, IF YOU DON'T SAY THE PROBLEM, AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, YOU'RE NEVER GONNA SOLVE THE PROBLEM. YOU'RE NEVER GONNA SOLVE IT. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM SAYING ""WE HAVE A PROBLEM."" I MEAN, THE WORLD TRADE CENTER GOT KNOCKED DOWN. PEOPLE ARE BEING KILLED ALL OVER THE PLACE. BY THE WAY, WHEN I LEFT TODAY, COLOGNE, GERMANY, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BEAT TO HELL. WOMEN HAVE BEEN RAPED. WHAT'S GOING ON IN GERMANY IS UNBELIEVABLE. AND WE HAVE TO BE SMART. WE CAN'T TAKE THESE PEOPLE FROM THE LINE THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE --   SO IT'S BECOME LARGELY, AND EVEN AT THE RALLIES, EVERYBODY HAS GREAT CONFIDENCE IN ME, WITH CHINA, WITH ALL THESE PLACES. AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WE'LL TAKE GREAT CARE OF THAT WHOLE SITUATION. WE'LL GET ALONG GREAT WITH THEM. IT WILL BE FINE. WE'RE GOING TO DO GREAT. BUT WE'RE GOING TO STRENGTHEN UP OUR BORDERS. WE'RE GOING TO GET ALONG WITH MEXICO. THEY'RE GOING TO RESPECT US MORE. THEY DON'T LIKE US NOW. THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE. THEY DON'T EVEN LIKE US. FORD IS BUILDING A PLANT THERE. NABISCO, CLOSING THEIR FACTORY IN CHICAGO, MOVING IT TO MEXICO. THAT DOESN'T HELP US, FOLKS. I WENT TO THE GREATEST SCHOOLS. I WENT TO THE WHARTON SCHOOL OF FINANCE, AN IVY LEAGUE COLLEGE. BUT IT DOES NOTHING FOR US. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE RESPECT. WE ARE GOING TO BE RESPECTED BY OTHER COUNTRIES NOW. WE'RE NOT RESPECTED. IT'S FUNNY. WE'RE LIKE THE BIG, FAT BULLY THAT GETS HIS ASS KICKED ALL THE TIME. NOBODY -- NOBODY RESPECTS IT. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE. WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE. AND WHAT I SAID BEFORE IS THIS. WE ARE GONNA WIN SO MUCH THAT YOU PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET SO TIRED OF IT. YOU'RE GOING TO BEG ME, PLEASE, PLEASE, NO MORE VICTORIES, MR. TRUMP.  NO MORE VICTORIES! WE CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE! GIVE US AT LEAST ONE OR TWO FAILURES. AND I'M GONNA SAY, NO WAY WE'RE GONNA HAVE FAILURES! WE'RE GONNA WIN ALL THE TIME! AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I LOVE YOU! THANK YOU! GET OUT AND VOTE! ","Donald Trump Campaign Rally in Clear Lake, Iowa"

WE HAVE HAD, NO MATTER WHERE WE GO -- IT IS A MOVEMENT, FOLKS. THIS IS A MOVEMENT. NO MATTER WHERE WE GO, IT IS AMAZING. WE GO TO DALLAS, OKLAHOMA, ALL OVER. WE WENT TO IOWA -- PACKED. EVERY PLACE, NEW HAMPSHIRE -- PACKED. EVERY PLACE WE GO TO IT IS LIKE THIS. GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE.   AND THEY ACTUALLY HAD TO TELL OVER 3000 PEOPLE GO HOME, WE WILL COME BACK, WE WILL DO ANOTHER ONE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEAVE AND WE WILL LET THEM COME IN?  I DIDN'T THINK SO. BUT WE TURNED AWAY A LOT OF PEOPLE, WHICH IS TOO BAD. I KNOW THIS IS A RECORD FOR THE ROOM. IT HAS TO BE A RECORD BECAUSE EVERY INCH OF THE ROOM IS TAKEN WITH PEOPLE AND THEY ARE STANDING, THEY ARE NOT SITTING. WE LOVE SETTING RECORDS. WE WANT THE COUNTRY TO SET RECORDS, RIGHT?   I DO THIS AND I LOVE TO DO IT AND I TALK ABOUT OUR SUCCESS BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THAT IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO FANTASTICALLY WELL IN IOWA. I COULD SAY, IF WE CAME IN THE TOP FOUR OR FIVE, I'M LOOKING TO WIN EVERYTHING. WE WANT TO RUN THE TABLE. THAT SENDS A SIGNAL. WE HAD TO RESPONSE TO HILLARY.   REMEMBER? SHE SAID, HE HAS DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT -- I DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? ME. NOBODY RESPECTS WOMEN MORE THAN DONALD TRUMP.   WHEN SHE SAID THAT, I HAD NO CHOICE. I DID NOT STARTED. I DID HAVE TO MENTION HER HUSBAND'S SITUATION. THAT IS NOW THE BIGGEST STORY ON TELEVISION BY A FACTOR OF 10. WE HAVE TO DO IT. YOU CAN'T LET PEOPLE PUSH YOU AROUND. YOU CAN'T LET PEOPLE TELL LIES. YOU CAN'T DO IT. IT IS INTERESTING. ONE OF THE POLLS CAME OUT FROM CNBC AND THEY SAID THAT IF IT IS TRUMP AGAINST HILLARY IN THE ELECTION, IT WILL BE THE GREATEST VOTER TURNOUT IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. I CAN SEE THAT. I CAN SEE IT. I CONCUR. THEY SAID ALL OF THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO COME IN NEW, THEY NEVER VOTE, THEY DON'T CARE. THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR TRUMP.  V  THEY  V  ARE  V  SO  V  FED  V  UP  V  WITH  V  THE  V  SYSTEM.  V  THIS  V  CORRUPT,  V  HORRIBLE  V  SYSTEM.  V ONE OF THESE GUYS AT 2% SAID, ""HE ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT HIS POLLS."" I WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT EITHER IF I WAS AT 2%.  MR. TRUMP: I SWEAR. I LOVE TO TELL THE STORY WHERE I HAVE SPENT NOTHING AND BUSH HAS SPENT $59 MILLION. MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT. SINCE THEN. YOU CAN'T OR NOT THE TELEVISION WITHOUT THESE COMMERCIALS. AND FOX, EVERY TWO MINUTES IT IS A COMMERCIAL ONE TRUMP. IT IS FALSE ADVERTISING. I KILLED HIM IN THE DEBATE. ACCORDING TO REUTERS, ACCORDING TO EVERYBODY, DRUDGE -- HE WAS AN AMAZING GUY, MATT DRUDGE -- GREAT GUY. DRUDGE, 46%. 46%, YOU HAVE 15 PEOPLE. A COUPLE OF DROPPED OUT. TIME MAGAZINE, 49%. THINK OF IT. SLATE, 51%. U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT, 69% SAID I WON THE DEBATE.  MR. TRUMP: PBS, PUBLIC BROADCASTING SYSTEM, 69% SAID TRUMP WON. IT IS AMAZING. WE HAVE ""WASHINGTON TIMES"" 62%. CBS, 59%. FOX LAS VEGAS, 62%. THEN THEY GO BACK HOME AFTER THE DEBATE. HOW DID I DO? LOOKING GOOD IS VERY IMPORTANT, RIGHT? SOMETIMES, IT IS NOT AS MUCH LIKE WHAT YOU SAY IS HOW DID YOU LOOK. I LOOKED GOOD, DIDN'T SOUND TOO GOOD, BUT THAT IS OK.  MR. TRUMP: I GO HOME AND I WATCH AND THE PUNDITS WILL SAY -- THEY CAN'T TOTALLY KILL ME BECAUSE WE KNOW IT IS HAPPENING -- WELL, MR. TRUMP WAS OK TONIGHT. I'M ON EVERY SINGLE ONLINE POLL AND I WON. BUSH DOES AN AD. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING AND THEN I KILLED HIM. BY THE WAY, I MET 69% AND HE IS AT 1%. HE CAME IN LAST. I SHOULDN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT HIM. IT BOTHERS ME WHEN I SEE A GUY SPENDING $60 MILLION ON ADS AGAINST ME, A LOT OF IT. I SAY, WHY IS HE DOING THIS? HE SHOULD GO HOME. JUST RELAX.  MR. TRUMP: HONESTLY, HE SHOULD GO HOME AND RELAX. IT DOES. WHY IS THIS GUY SPENDING ALL THIS MONEY? NOW HE IS SPENDING IT AGAINST A COUPLE OF OTHER GUYS WHO WERE ALSO VERY WEAK. HE MADE A STATEMENT AND AFTER THAT, HIS SPIN PEOPLE SAID HE WAS GREAT. HE TOOK ON TRUMP, HE TOOK ON TRUMP. HE MADE A STATEMENT THAT WAS WRITTEN BY HIS POLLSTER. HE SAID, ""MR. TRUMP, WHY DON'T YOU THIS."" I GAVE HIM AN ANSWER. I SAID, JEFF, I'M AT 42% AND YOU ARE A 2%. IT IS A SIMPLE ANSWER. YOU STARTED OFF HERE, RIGHT NEXT TO ME, AND THEN YOU WERE THERE, THEN YOU WERE THERE, BUT THE NEXT TIME, YOU ARE GOING TO BE OFF THE STAGE.   MR. TRUMP: THEN THAT WAS IT. I RESPONDED. THE ESTIMATE ME THE QUESTION. THE QUESTION WAS FINE. PROFESSIONALLY WRITTEN. I GIVE THEM AN ANSWER, I BLEW HIM AWAY. EVERYONE SAYS TRUMP WON THE DEBATE. THAT IS IT. THE AD IS HIM ASKING THE QUESTION AND I'M STANDING THERE LIKE THIS. IN ONE OF THEM, I'M JUST ABOUT READY TO OPEN MY MOUTH. IT IS ALMOST FOR US ADVERTISING -- FALSE ADVERTISING, ISN'T IT? HILLARY IS A DISASTER.  MR. TRUMP: SHE IS CONTROLLED BY HER MONEY. SO IS JED PERIODS -- JEB. SO IS EVERYBODY. I'M THE ONLY ONE SELF-FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN AREA  MR. TRUMP: ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES ME HAPPY. I HEARD ONE OF MY COMMENTATORS MENTIONED, I'VE BEEN WATCHING IT FOR 50 YEARS AND I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE TRUMP. I'M SPECIAL. YOU'RE SPECIAL. I LIKE YOU. I'M SPECIAL. ISN'T THAT NICE? EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING THAT HITS YOU. WHERE ARE YOU? WHO SAID THAT? WOW. SO NICE. THAT IS A NICE ONE. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, THERE IS A STATEMENT THAT IS EITHER NICE OR BRUTAL. I THINK LOW-ENERGY WAS A BRUTAL STATEMENT. LOW-ENERGY CAN BE APPLIED TO HILLARY. I JUST ELECT TO USE THE SAME THING TWICE ON ONE OF MY ENEMIES. I CONSIDER THEM ENEMIES. WE VIEW THIS AS WAR. DON'T WE VIEW THIS AS WAR?  MR. TRUMP: I HATE TO GIVE IT UP. WE ARE GOING TO HELP YOUR DAUGHTER. WE ARE GOING TO HELP THE COUNTRY, AS WELL AS YOUR DAUGHTER. WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE INCOMPETENT LEADERSHIP, OUR TRADE DEALS ARE KILLING US, OUR MILITARY IS NOT PREPARED. GENERAL LORDY ON OH SAID O -- ORDEONO SAID THAT WE ARE LESS PREPARED THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR. WE SHOULD BE VERY PREPARED. THE WORLD HATES US. SHE HAS DONE A TERRIBLE JOB AS SECRETARY OF STATE. THINK OF IT. PUTIN COMES OUT AND SAYS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS BRILLIANT, DOING AN AMAZING JOB, LEADING THE PACK. THAT'S NICE. SHE AND MY OPPONENTS -- WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF WE COULD GET ALONG WITH THE WORLD? WOULDN'T IT BE? WOULDN'T IT BE NICE?  MR. TRUMP: THEY WANT ME TO REFUTE HIS STATEMENT. HOW DARE YOU SAY I'M BRILLIANT.  MR. TRUMP: WHO'S GOING TO DO THAT? IF HE SAID IT ABOUT ANYONE OF THEM, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY. WE HAVE TO GET ALONG. THE WORLD HAS BLOWN UP AROUND BARACK OBAMA. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW HIS RECENT RELEASE. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND THEY SAID VERY STRONGLY -- THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE DONE. THEY COULD NOT FIND IT. WHAT HAVE THEY DONE THAT IS GOOD? THEY SAID BRINGING PEACE TO SYRIA. DID YOU SEE THAT?  MR. TRUMP: INSTEAD OF SAYING THEY MADE A MISTAKE, THEY MADE A MISTAKE, THEY ARE TRYING TO JUSTIFY IT. WE MEANT WE ARE WORKING ON IT. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? THE WORLD IS BLOWING UP. THE MIGRATION FROM SYRIA. THEY SAY ONE OF THEIR KEY THINGS FOR THE YEAR IS BRINGING PEACE TO SYRIA AND THE WHOLE WORLD SUFFERS. IT IS THE LEVEL OF STUPIDITY THAT IS INCREDIBLE. I USED TO USE THE WORD INCOMPETENT. NOW I JUST CALL THEM STUPID. I WENT TO AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL. I'M VERY HIGHLY EDUCATED. I KNOW WORDS, I HAVE THE BEST WORDS, BUT THERE IS NO BETTER WORD THAN STUPID. RIGHT?   MR. TRUMP: THERE IS NONE. THERE IS NO WORD LIKE THAT. WE ARE GOING TO TURN THINGS AROUND. AS YOU SAW IT, WITH HILLARY, SHE HAS BEEN HITTING ME REALLY HARD WITH THE WOMEN CARD. REALLY HARD. I HAD TO SAY, OK, THAT'S ENOUGH, THAT'S ENOUGH. WE DID A STRONG NUMBER. SHE IS NOT GOING TO WIN. I LOVE THE CONCEPT, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE HAVING A WOMAN PRESIDENT -- IT CANNOT BE HER. SHE IS HORRIBLE. SHE'S HORRIBLE. YOU KNOW WHO DOES NOT LIKE -- WE GOT A BANCA -- IVANKA -- I WILL TELL YOU WHO DOESN'T LIKE HILLARY -- WOMEN. WOMEN DON'T LIKE HILLARY.  MR. TRUMP: I SEE IT ALL THE TIME. MR. TRUMP SAID THIS AND THAT AND THIS AND THAT. SHE IS SO THEATRICAL. I SHOULD NOT DO IT. I JUST HAVE TO TURN OFF THE TELEVISION. SHE GIVES ME A HEADACHE. I THINK LAST NIGHT I GAVE HER A BIG HEADACHE. I CAN IMAGINE. I CAN IMAGINE THOSE DISCUSSIONS. YOU HAVE TO HIT BACK HARD. YOU CANNOT LET THEM PUSH YOU AROUND. TODAY, SHE NEVER EVEN MENTIONED BY NAME. IN THE DEBATE, I WAS MENTIONED NINE TIMES. ALL OF THEM. I WAS MENTIONED NINE TIMES. NONE OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES WERE MENTIONED. THEN SHE CAME OUT WITH THE SEXISM, WHICH IS SO NONSENSE, BUT SHE IS PLAYING THE CARD. I CAN IMAGINE. I CAN IMAGINE THOSE DISCUSSIONS. YOU HAVE TO HIT BACK HARD. I HIT HER BACK AND I TALKED ABOUT HER HUSBAND AND THE ABUSE OF WOMEN AND THE TREMENDOUS ABUSE. IT IS TREMENDOUS. I TALKED ABOUT THAT. TODAY, THE TELEVISION IS GOING CRAZY. SHE GETS UP AND MAKES A SPEECH AND DOES NOT EVEN MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT ME. I WONDER WHY. I WONDER WHY.  MR. TRUMP: REMEMBER THIS. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. A POLL JUST CAME OUT WHERE WE ARE TIED. ANOTHER ONE CAME OUT, FOX, WHERE WE ARE LEADING BY FOUR OR FIVE POINTS AGAINST OR INDIVIDUALLY. I HAVE NOT EVEN FOCUSED ON HER YET. LOOK AT THE PEOPLE I FOCUSED ON. I DON'T WANT TO REALLY KNOCK THEM. OF THOSE PEOPLE, THAT ARE ALL GONE, THEY ARE ALL PEOPLE THAT ATTACKED ME. WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF OUR COUNTRY COULD HAVE THAT SAME THING? YOU ATTACK AND THEY ARE GONE.  MR. TRUMP: WE COULD DO IT VERBALLY, THAT IS EVEN BETTER. WHO WANTS TO USE OUR MILITARY? WE ARE GOING TO BUILD THE STRONGEST, THE BEST, THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY EVER. EVER. EVER.  MR. TRUMP: EVER. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS.  MR. TRUMP: THEY ARE BEING TREATED HORRIBLY. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD THE STRONGEST, MOST POWERFUL MILITARY EVER. LET ME JUST TELL YOU A LITTLE SECRET. THE CHEAPEST THING WE CAN DO -- I DON'T THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO USE IT. THEY TALK ABOUT MY TONE. I REMEMBER WHEN JEB AND HILLARY TALKED ABOUT MY TONE. THEY ARE CHOPPING OFF CHRISTIANS HEADS IN SYRIA AND OTHER PLACES AND THEY WANT ME TO HAVE A NICE TONE. ISN'T LIFE WONDERFUL, OK? WE'VE GOT TO BE TOUGH. WE'VE GOT TO BE SMART. WE'VE GOT TO HAVE HEART. WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE. WE'VE GOT TO FIX OUR HEALTH CARE PROGRAM. THIS OBAMACARE IS A DISASTER. YOU PEOPLE KNOW.  MR. TRUMP:-- OBAMACARE IS A TOTAL CATASTROPHE. IT WILL DIE IN 2017 ANYWAY. ALL THE PEOPLE THAT THEY DIDN'T THINK WERE SIGNING UP ARE SIGNING UP. THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY PAYING FOR IT OR NOT SIGNING UP. YOUR RATES ARE GOING UP 25%, 35%, 45%. YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE IT. OBAMACARE IS A DISASTER. WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL IT HERE AND WE ARE GOING TO REPLACE IT. THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT THINGS WE CAN DO ON HEALTH CARE. SO MANY GOOD THINGS. AND IT WILL COST YOU LESS MONEY, AND IT WILL BE GREAT. YOU ARE USING PROGRAMS YOU WILL NEVER USE. YOU ARE PAYING FOR IT. YOU WILL NEVER EVER USE THEM. WE WILL GET THAT STRAIGHTENED OUT. COMMON CORE INSTEAD. IT'S GOING TO BE DEAD. WHEN I LOOK AT PARENTS, I SEE LOCAL PARENTS IN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA. I WENT TO A SCHOOL AND I SAW THE PARENTS. THEY LOVE THEIR CHILDREN. THEY WANT EDUCATE-- THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT MONEY, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING. LOVE THEIR CHILDREN. THEY GET TOGETHER AND THEY DO WONDERFUL PROGRAMS. THEY ARE SMART PEOPLE. AS OPPOSED TO GETTING IT DONE BY BUREAUCRATS WHO ARE GETTING BIG, FAT CHECKS IN WASHINGTON. WE HAVE SUCH TALENT IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE DON'T USE IT. SO, OBAMACARE, DEAD. COMMON CORE, GONE. WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF IT. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF IT. WE ARE BRINGING EDUCATION -- ONE THING ON EDUCATION. SO, IN THE WORLD, WE ARE RANKED NUMBER 28. THERE ARE THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES THAT ARE RANKED BETTER THAN US IN EDUCATION AND MANY OTHER THINGS. AND YET, PER PUPIL, WE ARE NUMBER ONE, BY FAR. THERE IS NOBODY CLOSE. WE SPEND MORE MONEY FOR PUPIL THAN ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND WE ARE RANKED NUMBER 28. WHICH IS WAY DOWN AT THE BOTTOM, ESSENTIALLY. CAN YOU IMAGINE WE ARE RANKED NUMBER 28 AND WE ARE NUMBER ONE? THAT'S WHAT I DO LIKE SAYING ABOUT MY CAMPAIGN, I SPENT LESS MONEY THAN ANYBODY ELSE AND I HAVE THE BEST RESULTS. I'M NUMBER ONE BY A LOT AND I SPENT NO MONEY. I SPENT NO ADS. LITTLE RADIO AD IN IOWA. THE STATION IS SO LOVELY. I SPENT EVENTUALLY NO MONEY. THEN YOU HAVE ALL THESE OTHER GUYS -- I SPENT POTENTIALLY NO MONEY. THEN YOU HAVE ALL THESE OTHER GUYS SPENDING VAST -- WHY WOULD WE PUT SOME OF THESE OTHER GUYS -- JEB BUSH, I SEE RUBIO ON THE ADS ALL DAY LONG. YOU KNOW THE BLACK BACKGROUND. HE SHOULD HAVE PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEHIND HIM. THE FLAG, RIGHT? AND I LIKE HIM. I THINK HE IS A NICE GUY. THESE ADS WITH THE BACKDROP -- IT IS JUST SOMBER. THINK OF IT. I SPENT NO MONEY AND I'M NUMBER ONE. OTHERS SPENT -- THEY WILL HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THEY ARE NOT EVEN IN THE RACE. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED FOR OUR COUNTRY. WHAT? ""I'VE GOT 15,000,"" I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE MEANS BY THAT. HE IS NOT A PROTESTER. OK, I LOVE YOU.  MR. TRUMP: THE ONLY TIME THE CAMERA'S FOCUS ON THE CROWD IS WHEN WE HAVE A PROTESTER. I ALWAYS HAVE THE BIGGEST CROWDS. I GO HOME AND MY WIFE SAID WERE THERE MANY PEOPLE? I WATCHED YOU ON TELEVISION TONIGHT. I SAID, I HAD 20,000 PEOPLE. SHE SAID, THEY DIDN'T SHOW IT. THEY HAVE IT RIGHT ON YOUR FACE. I HAVE 20,000 PEOPLE. 20,000 IN OKLAHOMA, 35,000 IN MOBILE, ALABAMA. NOBODY KNOWS. THE CAMERAS, I THINK THEY MIGHT BE FIXED. EXCEPT EVERY TIME THERE IS A GUY THAT STANDS UP PROTESTING, THEY ARE ON DRUGS OR SOMETHING, THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY ARE DOING THERE, ALL THE SUDDEN, THE CAMERA'S WORDS FROM THEIR PERFECT SHOT -- THE CAMERA S SWERVE FROM THEIR PERFECT SHOT. AND I LIKE IT, BECAUSE IT SHOWS THE CROWD. I WILL PUT IN SOME FALSE PROTESTERS. IT'S THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THE CROWD IN. I TALKED ABOUT TRADE. I TALKED ABOUT THE BORDER. I TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS. I STARTED ON JUNE 16 IN TRUMP TOWER. IT TAKES GUTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. IT'S LIKE, I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE. WE HAD THE LARGEST DEBATE. WE HAVE A LARGEST AUDIENCE IN HISTORY CABLE TELEVISION. THEN CNN, A COUPLE WEEKS LATER, HAD 23 MILLION. FOX HAD 24 MILLION. THE LARGEST AUDIENCE IN THE HISTORY OF CNN. THERE ARE CAMERAS ON LIVE RIGHT NOW. THE LARGEST AUDIENCE IN THE HISTORY OF CNN. IF YOU GO BACK FOUR OR EIGHT YE ARS, NOBODY EVEN WANTED THE DEBATES. I THINK THEY WERE FORCED TO TAKE THEM FOR LICENSING, BUT NOBODY WANTED THE DEBATES. NOW THEY ARE DRAWING 24 MILLION. NOW THEY WANT TO HAVE MORE. CAN THEY GO THREE HOURS? REMEMBER WHEN THEY HAD THE ONE GO THREE HOURS AND I SAID, NO, I'M NOT DOING THREE HOURS? I COULD STAND UP HERE FOR 50 HOURS, BUT WHO THE HELL WANTS TO SIT HOME WATCHING THREE HOURS OF THIS STUFF? MR. TRUMP:, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS, WHAT WOULD YOU DO ABOUT ISIS? OH, GREAT. BY THE WAY, I HATE THOSE QUESTIONS. I WANT TO BE UNPREDICTABLE I DON'T WANT TO TELL -- UNPREDICTABLE. I DON'T WANT TO TELL ISIS WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. I HATE IT. REMEMBER, I SAID VERY STRONGLY -- YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING. FOUR YEARS, I SAID GET THE OIL. IRAN IS TAKING OVER IRAQ. WE MADE A DEAL FOR IRAN. DONE BY SOME OF THE DUMBEST PEOPLE HONORS ON OUR SIDE. WE GAVE THEM -- PEOPLE ON EARTH ON OUR SIDE. WE GAVE THEM EVERYTHING. WE WON'T EVEN GET OUR PRISONERS BACK. ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS SAY WE WANT OUR PRISONERS BACK. THEY WOULD'VE SAID NO. I WOULD HAVE SAID I WANT THEM BACK, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME, I WANT THEM BACK. THEY WOULD HAVE SAID, NO, WE WON'T DO THAT. I WOULD'VE SAID BYE-BYE AND LEFT. I WOULD HAVE DOUBLED UP THE SANCTIONS. AND I GUARANTEE YOU --  MR. TRUMP: I GUARANTEE YOU THAT WITHIN 24 HOURS THEY WOULD'VE CALLED BACK AND SAY, YOU'VE GOT YOUR PRISONERS, CAN WE TALK? I WOULD HAVE NEVER GIVEN THE $150 BILLION. I WOULD HAVE NEVER GIVEN THEM THE MONEY. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BUY NUCLEAR. THEY CAN BUY IT. WHY DO THEY HAVE TO MAKE IT? WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE NUCLEAR WITH THE INSPECTIONS. THEY DON'T WANT US THERE. THEY SELF INSPECT. THEY HAVE A 24 DAY INSPECTION, BUT THE SELF INSPECTION IS THE BEAUTY. WE THINK YOU ARE MAKING NUCLEAR WEAPONS HERE. LET US GO AND CHECK, MR. PRESIDENT. WE WILL GO CHECK. NO, SIR, WE ARE NOT MAKING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. WE WOULD NEVER DO A THING LIKE THAT. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DECEIVED US, LIED TO US, THEY ARE TERRORISTS. I USED TO SAY IT IS THE WORST DEAL THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN NEGOTIATED. PRISONERS -- THEY COME BACK, WE GET OUR PRISONERS. THEN WHEN I HEAR THE OTHER DAY THAT, NOW THIS DEAL IS DONE, NOW I HEAR THEY WANT TO NEGOTIATE. THEY SAID VERY STRONGLY, WE ARE GOING TO WANT A LOT FOR THE PRISONERS. WE ARE GOING TO WANT A LOT. WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN OFF THE SANCTIONS. THEY ARE ALREADY RICH AS HELL. WHAT IS GOING ON THERE? THAT'S WHY I SAY, I MEAN -- SOME PEOPLE SAY IT IS -- THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT, HONESTLY. I'M NOT SAYING THAT. I'M NOT A CONSPIRACY PERSON. SHE SAID, ""WE ARE."" HALF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM ARE SAYING IT. I'M JUST HOPING THAT YOU ARE STUPID PEOPLE, WHICH THEY ARE, OR THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON. BECAUSE IT IS INCONCEIVABLE. DID YOU EVER SEE WHERE SOME THINGS ARE SO BAD THAT IT CANNOT BE -- THAT NOBODY CAN DO WHAT THEY DID? RIGHT, NOBODY. IRAN NOW WANTS TO NEGOTIATE SEPARATELY. THAT DEAL IS DONE. NOW WE WANT TO START A NEW DEAL. WE WANT A LOT. I WANT TO JUST SHOOT THE TELEVISION. YOU KNOW?? BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD IT -- AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ASKED, KERRY AND OBAMA -- THE DEAL WAS MADE. EVERYBODY KNOWS IT IS A HORRIBLE DEAL. IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO TREMENDOUS NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION. THEY ARE SO RICH NOW. THEY BECAME SO RICH. AND MANY OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT. MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE AGREEMENT SAYS. BUT I WILL TRY YOU WHAT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE DOING, IF WE KEEP GOING LIKE THIS, FOLKS, WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY LEFT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY. WE ARE LIKE A DUMPING GROUND FOR THE WORLD. WE ARE A DUMPING GROUND. THEY WANT TO TAKE THESE MIGRANTS --  AND I FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT THE MIGRATION CAUSED BY HILLARY CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT CAUSED IT. THEY GO INTO LIBYA, THEY KNOCKED THE HELL OUT OF GADDAFI. THEY BACKED REBELS WHO END UP KILLING THE AMBASSADOR AND THE OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE. THE AMBASSADOR WAS RIDING IN A JEEP, ONE OF OUR JEEPS, OF COURSE, A MILITARY JEEP, HOLDING THE LIBYAN FLAG, ""FREEDOM, FREEDOM, FREEDOM,"" AND HE GETS KILLED BY THE SAME PEOPLE. SO, WE BACKED PEOPLE THAT TURNED OUT TO BE FAR WORSE THAN GADDAFI. LOOK WHAT WE DID IN IRAQ. WHAT WE DID IN IRAQ -- LOOK WHAT WE DID IN IRAQ. WHAT THE HELL DID WE GET? WE SPENDT $2 TRILLION, WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF DEATHS, AND I'M NOT EVEN TALKING OTHER SIDE. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, MAYBE MILLIONS. YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF DEATHS, WOUNDED WARRIORS, WHO I LOVE. THESE GUYS ARE THE TOUGHEST -- THESE ARE THE GREATEST PEOPLE.  MR. TRUMP: THESE ARE THE GREATEST PEOPLE. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS? WE LEAVE, AND WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT ANNOUNCES THE DATE OF WHEN WE ARE LEAVING. SO, I SAID, MAN, IF I'M THE ENEMY, I'M JUST GOING TO GO WAIT FOR 18 MONTHS. HE GAVE A DATE, WE ARE LEAVING IRAQ, WE WILL BE GONE BY SUCH AND SUCH A TIME. I'M JUST SITTING THERE WATCHING AND I'M SAYING, MAN, THAT'S REALLY STUPID. BECAUSE, BELIEVE ME, THE ENEMY DOESN'T WANT TO BE KILLED. YOU PIERCE SO MUCH THEY WANT TO GO WITH THE VIRGINS UP -- YOU HEAR SO MUCH THEY WANT TO GO WITH THE VIRGINS UP WHEREVER THEY GO. USING THEIR WIVES DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE PLANNING -- YOU THINK THEIR WIVES DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE PLANNING? YOU THINK THEIR KIDS DON'T KNOW WHAT DADDY IS GOING TO DO WHEN HE IS PLANNING TO FLY INTO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER? THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON. FRANKLY, I THINK THEY HAVE MORE LOVE FOR THEIR FAMILY'S LIVES THAN THEY DO FOR THEIR OWN LIVES. BUT THEY STILL WANT TO LIVE. HERE IS OBAMA. HE GIVES AN EXACT DATE, SO THEY PULL BACK. EVERYONE SAYS, OH, WE ARE DOING SO WELL. WHY SHOULD THEY FIGHT WHEN THEY KNOW, IN 18 MONTHS, THEY CAN GO IN AND TAKE THE PLACE? SO WE HAVE ISIS TAKING A LOT OF OIL. I SAID TAKE THE OIL. REMEMBER, I WAS OPPOSED BECAUSE I SAID WE WOULD DESTABILIZE. YOU HAVE IRAQ AND IRAN. THERE WAS FIGHTING FOR DECADES AND DECADES, FOR GENERATIONS. THEY FIGHT, THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. THEY FIGHT. HOW WE EVER GOT INVOLVED IN THIS MESS IS HARD TO BELIEVE. THEY FIGHT, AND THEY WERE EQUAL MILITARILY. THEY GO THIS WAY, 10 FEET. THEY GO THIS WAY, 10 FEET. THEN THEY REST. THEY START FIGHTING AGAIN. SADDAM HUSSEIN THROWS A LITTLE GAS. EVERYONE GOES CRAZY. BACK AND FORTH. IT'S THE SAME. AND THEY WERE STABILIZED. AND I SAID, IF YOU GO AFTER ONE OR THE OTHER, IN THIS CASE IRAQ, YOU'RE GOING TO DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. WE TOTALLY DESTABILIZED THE MIDDLE EAST. WE HAVE MIGRATIONS LARGELY BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED AFTERWARDS. IRAQ WAS HORRIBLE. IT WAS STUPID TO GO IN AND WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER GONE IN. BUT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN OUT THE WAY WE WENT OUT. AND WE SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN DATES. I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY SAID WE WOULD STAY FOREVER. AND THEY WOULD HAVE SAID, OH, MAN. EVENTUALLY THEY WOULD GET TIRED. THIS GUY IS CRAZY. AND YOU MAKE A DEAL. WHEN YOU ANNOUNCE YOU ARE LEAVING IN 18 MONTHS OR WHATEVER THE HELL HE SAID, THEY JUST PULL BACK. AS SOON AS WE LEFT, THEY COME IN. WE HAVE THE OIL. THE BIGGEST BENEFACTOR OF THE OIL IS CHINA. ALWAYS CHINA. I LOVE CHINA. I LOVE MEXICO. THEY ARE LEADERS. WE HAVE NO BORDER. WE WILL BUILD A WALL. MEXICO WILL PAY FOR THE BALL, BY THE WAY -- THE WALL, BY THE WAY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A BORDER. AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY, BUT THEY ARE GOING TO COME IN THROUGH A LEGAL PROCESS, NOT JUST WALKING IN LIKE NOTHING. THEY ARE GOING TO COME IN, BUT THEY ARE GOING TO COME THROUGH A LEGAL PROCESS. SO, WITH IRAQ, SO WE GIVE THEM THE DATE AND THEY TAKE OVER. FOR FOUR YEARS, I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT. THEN BECAUSE OF PARIS -- I DIDN'T JUST WANT TO BOMB THE OIL, I WANTED TO TAKE THE OIL. SO, WE ARE BOMBING. AND WE ARE NOT REALLY BOMBING IT, BECAUSE THEY ARE STILL SELLING IT. HOW COULD THEY KEEP SELLING -- OBAMA DOES NOT WANT TO HIT THEM TOO HARD BECAUSE HE IS AFRAID HE IS GOING TO POLLUTE THE ATMOSPHERE. NO, THIS IS SERIOUS. THINK OF IT. HE TALKS ABOUT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT, AND YET HE WILL FLY A VERY OLD AIR FORCE ONE, AN OLD BOEING 747, SPEWING STUFF. HE'S GOT A PROBLEM WITH THE CARBON FOOTPRINT. YOU CAN'T USE HAIRSPRAY, BECAUSE HAIRSPRAY IS GOING TO AFFECT THE OZONE. I'M IN MY ROOM IN NEW YORK CITY, AND I WANT TO PUT A LITTLE SPRAY --   MR. TRUMP: RIGHT? BUT I HEAR WHERE THEY DON'T WANT ME TO USE HAIRSPRAY. THEY WANTED TO USE THE PUMP, WHICH THE OTHER ONE, WHICH I REALLY LIKED BETTER THAN GOING BING, BING, BING, AND IT COMES OUT IN BLOGS -- GLOBS. THEY SAY DON'T USE HAIRSPRAY, IT IS BAD FOR THE OZONE. I DO LIVE IN A VERY NICE APARTMENT. IS BEAUTIFUL. -- IT IS BEAUTIFUL. I DON'T THINK ANYTHING GETS OUT. AND I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE USING HAIRSPRAY. SO, OBAMA IS ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT THE GLOBAL WARMING -- THAT GLOBAL WARMING IS OUR BIGGEST AND MOST DANGEROUS THREAT. EVEN IF YOU ARE A BELIEVER IN GLOBAL WARMING, ISIS IS A BIG PROBLEM. RUSSIA IS A PROBLEM. CHINA IS A PROBLEM. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS. THE MANIAC IN NORTH KOREA IS A PROBLEM. HE ACTUALLY HAS NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR WE GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS. THAT'S RIGHT. WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE. IF I GET ELECTED, WE ARE GOING TO WIN. IF I GET ELECTED, WE ARE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH -- WE ARE GOING TO WIN A LOT.  MR. TRUMP: WE ARE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH YOU ARE ALL GOING TO GET SICK AND TIRED OF WINNING. YOU SAY, OH, NO, NOT AGAIN. I'M ONLY KIDDING. YOU NEVER GET TIRED OF LEANING, NEVER. BUT THINK OF IT. SO, OBAMA IS TALKING ABOUT ALL OF THIS WITH THE GLOBAL WARMING. A LOT OF IT IS A HOAX. IT'S A MONEYMAKING INDUSTRY, OK? A LOT OF IT. I WANT CLEAN AIR AND I WANT CLEAN WATER. I WANT CLEAN, CRYSTAL WATER. AND I WANT CLEAN AIR. AND WE CAN DO THAT. BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO DESTROY OUR BUSINESSES. AND BY THE WAY, CHINA ISN'T ABIDING BY ANYTHING. WE CANNOT USE COAL ANYMORE, ESSENTIALLY. THEY ARE BUYING OUR COAL AND USING IT. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE PLANET, IT IS SO BIG OUT THERE, WE ARE HERE, THEY ARE THERE. IT'S LIKE THEY'RE OUR NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR. IN TERMS OF THE UNIVERSE. MISS UNIVERSE MADE A GREAT DEAL WHEN I SOLD IT. OH, DID I GET RICH. THEY BROKE MY CHOPPERS ON THAT. THEY SAID, HE TALKS ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. WE ARE NOT GOING TO PUT HIM ON TELEVISION. FIRST OF ALL, UNIVISION IS BEING SUED LIKE CRAZY. NBC, I MADE A GREAT DEAL WITH THEM. FAR MORE THAN I WOULD HAVE EVER GOTTEN IF I SAID I THINK I'M GOING TO SELL IT. ISN'T IT AMAZING THIS CAN WORK OUT? BUT I LOVE MISS UNIVERSE. AND I LOVE THE UNIVERSE. THINK OF IT, CHINA IS SPEWING UP ALL OF THIS STUFF. WE ARE HOLDING BACK. WITH CHINA, WE SIGNED THESE AGREEMENTS WHERE WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW. THEY HAVE TO DO IT WITHIN 30 OR 35 YEARS. I DON'T THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BE DOING IT. IT'S LIKE JAPAN. IF SOMEBODY ATTACKS JAPAN, WE HAVE TO GO AND START WORLD WAR III. IF WE GET ATTACKED, JAPAN DOESN'T HAVE TO HELP US. SOMEHOW, THAT DOESN'T SOUND SO FAIR. DOES THAT SOUND GOOD? SO, SOUTH KOREA -- THOUSANDS OF TELEVISIONS PER YEAR. I ORDERED TELEVISIONS BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF STUFF. THEY ARE ALL MADE IN SOUTH KOREA, MOST OTHER THAN SONY. SONY, IN ALL FAIRNESS, HAS LOST ITS WAY. A LOT OF -- SAMSUNG, ALL OF THEM. THEY ARE ALL PRETTY MUCH -- ALL OF THEM, RIGHT? I THINK JUST ABOUT. I ORDERED THOUSANDS OF TELEVISIONS, THEY ARE ALL FROM SOUTH KOREA. WE HAVE 28,000 PEOPLE ON THE BORDER SEPARATING SOUTH KOREA FROM THIS MANIAC IN NORTH KOREA. WHAT DID WE GET? NOTHING. THEY ARE MAKING A FORTUNE. IT'S AN ECONOMIC BEHEMOTH. A LOT OF YOU DON'T KNOW WE PROTECT GERMANY. GERMANY, MERCEDES-BENZ. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE A MERCEDES-BENZ QUESTION MARK WE PROTECT GERMANY. IT'S AN ECONOMIC BEHEMOTH. WE PROTECT SAUDI ARABIA. DURING THE GOOD OIL, THEY WERE MAKING $1 BILLION PER DAY. WE PROTECT THEM. OUR MILITARY PROTECT -- THEY PAY US PEANUTS, LIKE NOTHING. AND IF WE WANT TO BUY, MOVED TO ANOTHER LOCATION -- WELL, THAT'S VERY EXPENSIVE. THEY WANT TO CHARGE US RENT? LOOK, WE ARE RUN BY PEOPLE THAT ARE SO BAD, SO OUT OF THEIR LEAGUE. AND I SEE IT ON THE STAGE. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK I DON'T LIKE THESE GUYS. I DO LIKE THEM, BUT THEY DON'T HAVE BUSINESS SENSE. THEY DON'T HAVE COMMON SENSE. THEY ARE POLITICIANS. THEY ARE ALL TALK. THEY ARE NO ACTION.  FOLKS, WHEN I SAY WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL. MOST OF THEM SAY, YOU CAN'T BUILD A WALL. IN CHINA, 2000 YEARS AGO --  MR. TRUMP: THEY BUILT THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA, WHICH IS BIGGER THAN ANY WALL WE ARE THINKING ABOUT. THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA GOES 18,000 MILES. WE HAVE 2000 MILES, OF WHICH WE REALLY ONLY NEED 1000 MILES, BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT OF NATURAL BARRIERS THAT ARE EXTREMELY TOUGH TO GET ACROSS. WE HAVE 1000 MILES. CHINA HAS 18,000 MILES OR 13,000 MILES, AND WE HAVE 1000 MILES. WE HAVE MODERN CRANES, CATERPILLAR TRACTORS. I WANT TO USE CATERPILLAR, MADE IN AMERICA.  MR. TRUMP: EVEN MY HATS, THEY ARE MADE IN AMERICA. IT WAS AN EASY TO FIND A GUY WHO COULD MAKE THOSE HATS. I SEE SO MANY OF THOSE KNOCKOFFS. ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT"" -- MINE ARE MADE IN AMERICA. THEY DON'T PRODUCE AS MANY AS I WOULD LIKE BECAUSE, FRANKLY --  I MEAN, IT'S AMAZING. THOSE HATS ARE AMAZING. ANYWAY, BUT I ALSO KNEW THAT AS SOON AS THE HATS -- WE HAVE A WEBSITE. AS SOON AS THE HATS CAME OUT, I KNEW THE PRESS WOULD BE CALLING. FIRST HOUR WHEN THE HATS WERE ANNOUNCED, I GET A CALL FROM ""THE NEW YORK TIMES."" MR. TRUMP, WHERE ARE THOSE HATS MADE? I SAID, AMERICA. I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT. AS YOU KNOW, IF I WOULD HAVE SAID CHINA, I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN BIG TROUBLE. BUT THEY ARE BEING KNOCKED OFF ALL OVER THE WORLD. THEY ARE LIKE HELMETS. I SEE THEM ALL. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? WE HAVE TO BUILD A WALL. WHEN I TALK AND I'M UP ON THE STAGE WITH THESE GUYS, THESE PEOPLE, WONDERFUL PEOPLE, AND A VERY NICE WOMAN, CARLY. SHE'S A VERY NICE WOMAN. WHEN I'M UP ON THE STAGE WITH THEM, THEY THINK I'M CRAZY. WERE GOING TO BUILD A WALL, IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT WALL -- WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL, IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT WALL. I'M TALKING ABOUT, IF THEY EVER GET UP THERE, THEY ARE NEVER COME DOWN, BECAUSE IT IS TOO DANGEROUS. YOU EVER SEE WHAT THEY DO NOW WITH THESE LITTLE WALLS? THEY BUILD A RAMP. WOULDN'T IT BE CHEAPER TO KNOCK THE WALL DOWN? THEY DRIVE OVER IT WITH JEEPS LOADED UP WITH DRUGS. THERE WAS A PICTURE IN ""TIME MAGAZINE."" IT'S A LITTLE RAMP THAT GOES OVER. MAKE MONEY. WE GET THE DRUGS. THINK OF IT. WE COULD BUILD A WALL. WE GET THE DRUGS, THEY GET THE CASH. NOT SO GOOD, RIGHT? WE DON'T LIKE THAT DEAL. OUR POLITICIANS DON'T KNOW. THEY DON'T KNOW. SO, WHEN I SAY MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT. THEY ARE NOT BUSINESS PEOPLE. MEXICO MAKES A FORTUNE OFF THE UNITED STATES. NUMBER ONE, WE GIVE THEM A LOT OF MONEY. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT, THEY ARE TAKING OUR BUSINESSES. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A TRADE DEFICIT. MEXICO, IN A CERTAIN WAY, IS A MINI VERSION OF THE NEW CHINA. MEXICO IS MAKING AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE, PEANUTS COMPARED TO THE COST OF THE WALL. LET'S SAY THE COST OF THE WALL IS $10 BILLION. I CAN DO A GREAT JOB WITH THAT. I THINK WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF MONEY LEFT OVER. 20 YEARS AGO, THEY WANTED TO BUILD A WALL. PEOPLE THAT ARE OPPOSED TO IT NOW, THEY WANTED TO STOP AND BUILD A WALL. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE REASONS THEY DID NOT BUILD THE WALL? BECAUSE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. THEY COULD NOT GET AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY IMPROVED -- APPROVED. THE THERE WAS A TOAD OR A SNAKE OR SOMETHING IN THE WAY -- BECAUSE THERE WAS A TOAD OR A SNAKE OR SOMETHING IN THE WAY. IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, THERE WERE THESE LOW-LEVEL LANDMASSES THAT WERE COVERED BY WATER, BUT PRETTY CLOSE TO THE TOWN. CHINA SENDS IN MASSIVE EXCAVATORS AND THEY ARE BUILDING MILITARY FORTRESSES IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA. A FRIEND OF MINE, WHO IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND RICHEST PEOPLE IN CHINA -- THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE. THEY ARE FUN. THEN LEADERS ARE TOO SMART -- THEIR LEADERS ARE TOO SMART FOR OUR PEOPLE. THEY WON'T NEED TO SMART WHEN I PUT MY PEOPLE THERE. -- THEY WON'T BE TOO SMART WHEN I PUT MY PEOPLE THERE.  MR. TRUMP: WHEN I CALL UP, WE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE DONOR -- NO, THE DONOR NOW IS CARL ICAHN. GREAT BUSINESSMAN. ALL THESE BUSINESSPEOPLE CALL. FRIEND OF MINE. I CALL THEM AND I SAY, YOU ARE ACTUALLY DOING IT. THEY ARE JOKING. HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO GET STARTED? DID YOU HAVE TO GET A NEW ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY APPROVED IN ORDER TO EXCAVATE? HE LOOKED AT ME AND GOES, I HOPE YOU ARE KIDDING WHEN YOU SAY THAT. THEY CONCEIVED OF THE IDEA AND THEY STARTED DIGGING FOUR HOURS LATER. THERE IS NO GO THROUGH 25 YEARS OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, YOU ARE GOING TO HURT THE SNAIL. YOU'RE GOING TO HURT THIS. THEY ARE DOING A BIG THING. THEY EXCAVATED -- MASSIVE. THEY ARE RIPPING THE HELL OUT OF THAT OCEAN. THEY ARE RIPPING IT AND THEY ARE TAKING THAT DEREK AND THEY ARE PUTTING IT -- THAT DIRT AND THEY ARE PUTTING AIRFIELDS. THEY COULDN'T DO IT. WE COULD NOT GET AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT -- THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE ONLY REASON IT HAPPENED. I HEARD THE COSTS WERE TOO HIGH. I'M UNDER BUDGET, I'M HEADED SCHEDULE. LOOK AT CAMPAIGN -- THE CAMPAIGN. A GUY HAS $59 MILLION AND HE WAS DOWN AT THE BOTTOM. I'M NOTHING AND I'M AT THE TOP. IT'S THE SAME THING.  MR. TRUMP: I ACTUALLY SAID -- IT'S FUNNY. THE OTHER DAY I GOT THIS GREAT REVIEW. THEY SAID ""TRUMP IS A GREAT SPEAKER. THE CROWD IS SPELLBOUND. BUT HE HAS ONE PROBLEM."" THE PROBLEM -- ""THE PROBLEM IS HE SPEAKS THROUGH THE APPLAUSE."" AND YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE I'M SO EXCITED, BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH POTENTIAL. I DON'T WANT TO WAIT FOR YOUR FREAKING APPLAUSE. WE HAVE SO MUCH POTENTIAL. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO DO. I DON'T WANT TO WAIT. I JUST DID IT AGAIN. YOU WERE GETTING READY TO GIVE A BIG APPLAUSE, BECAUSE YOU LIKE THAT, AND I'M SPEAKING. I KILLED THE APPLAUSE. HE IS RIGHT. BUT I'M NOT A SPEAKER. I'M A DOER. I GET THINGS DONE.  MR. TRUMP: SO, WHEN THE PEOPLE UPON THE STAGE WITH ME -- AND HILLARY, HILLARY DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE. YOU TALK ABOUT LOW ENERGY. SHE HAS LOWER ENERGY THAN JEB BUSH, WHICH IS HARD TO BELIEVE. SHE DOES. MAYBE IT'S RUDE, MAYBE IT IS NOT. IT DOESN'T MATTER. WE HAVE A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM. HAVE TO SAVE OUR COUNTRY. SO, IF I'M RUDE, IF PEOPLE THINK I'M RUDE -- I'M ACTUALLY A NICE PERSON. I WANT TO HELP PEOPLE. I WANT TO SEE MIGRATION. I WANT TO DO A SAFE ZONE IN SYRIA. I DON'T WANT THEM COMING HERE. WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE. THEY ARE UNDOCUMENTED.  MR. TRUMP: WE SHOULD DO A SAFE ZONE OVER THERE. WE SHOULD ASK THE BOTH STATES, SAUDI ARABIA, THESE STATES ARE NOT SPENDING. THEY HAVE TO SPEND. THEY HAVE TO PAY. WE ARE PROTECTING THEM. THEY WOULDN'T BE THERE FOR TWO MINUTES IF WE WEREN'T PROTECTING THEM. THEY HAVE TO START PAYING. THEY ARE NOT TAKING ANYBODY. HOW ABOUT GERMANY? CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT SHE IS DOING TO THAT COUNTRY? AND SHE WAS THE PERSON OF THE YEAR AND I WASN'T. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO. -- TO DO? I THINK SHE HAS MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. WE WILL FIND OUT. TIME WILL TELL. THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS CRIME PROBLEMS. I THINK SHE HAS MADE A TREMENDOUS MISTAKE. BUT IN SYRIA, WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY, MEANING THE GULF STATES AND GERMANY AND OTHERS -- GERMANY IS PAYING A FORTUNE TO ACCEPT ALL THESE PEOPLE. WE DO A MASSIVE SAFE ZONE. EVENTUALLY, WHEN THIS WHOLE CATASTROPHE STRAIGHTENS OUT, WHICH I WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO GET IT STRAIGHTENED OUT. WHEN IT IS STRAIGHTENED OUT, THEY COULD GO HOME TO THEIR COUNTRY, TO THEIR AREA. IT IS INTERESTING, I HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO WORK FOR ME. THOUSANDS. I HAVE PEOPLE THAT COME FROM FAR. A ARE ALL HERE LEGALLY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. I USE EVERIFY. THEY GO AND CHECK. EVERYBODY WALK THEIR DOG -- WALKS THEIR DOG. THEY SAID THEY FOUND ONE PERSON OUT OF HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. IT IS POSSIBLE -- WE DO HAVE 11 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY. IT IS PROBABLY A MUCH HIGHER NUMBER THAN THAT. IT IS PROBABLY A MUCH HIGHER NUMBER. BUT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND WE ARE GOING TO. SO, I JUST WANT TO FINISH BY SAYING THIS. LOOK, WE HAVE A SITUATION THAT IS OUT OF CONTROL. OUR COUNTRY IS A DUMPING GROUND FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD. WE ARE LAUGHED AT BY THE REST OF THE WORLD. AND WHEN I STARTED THIS JOURNEY, AND IT IS A JOURNEY, AND I DO LOVE YOU PEOPLE COME YOU ARE AMAZING PEOPLE. AND BY THE WAY, YOU ARE SO SMART. WELL, MR. TRUMP'S PEOPLE ARE BLUE-COLLAR. I LOVE BLUE-COLLAR. I'M HONORED BY THAT. THEY ARE NOT BLUE-COLLAR. WE HAVE BLUE-COLLAR, EXECUTIVES, YOUNG PEOPLE. THEY SAY THE AUDIENCE IS OLD. IT'S NOT OLDER. THE OTHER NIGHT IN IOWA, I TOLD THAT, AND ACTUALLY WE HAVE SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE, THE PLACE ERUPTED. WE HAVE AN AMAZING THING HAPPENING.  IT IS JUST -- LOOK, THAT'S THEIR WAY OF MARGINALIZING, NOT EVEN ME, THEY ARE MARGINALIZING YOU. IT IS DISGUSTING. WHEN I STARTED THIS JOURNEY --  THAT'S WHAT IT IS, A JOURNEY, OF MOVEMENTREMEMBER THE OLD DAYS OF THE SILENT MAJORITY? THIS IS A NOISY MAJORITY. I HAVE PEOPLE AND YOU CAN'T EVEN HEAR -- THIS IS AN AMAZING THING THAT IS HAPPENING. I RECEIVED A CALL FROM A REPORTER WHO HAPPENS TO BE LIBERAL. WE CAN HAVE A COUPLE OF THEM. A GUY WHO'S REALLY RESPECTED AND HE SAYS HOW DOES IT FEEL. HE SAYS WHAT YOU HAVE DONE HAS NEVER BEEN DONE IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS IN THE UNITED STATES . EVEN CNN SAYS NUMBER ONE POLITICAL STORY -- ISIS WAS NUMBER TWO. NOT THE HELL OUT OF THEM AND MAKE ME NUMBER ONE NEXT YEAR.  THIS REPORTER, WHO IS A GREAT INTELLECT, HE SAYS WHAT YOU HAVE DONE HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. NEWT GINGRICH WAS ON A TELEVISION SHOW AND SAID THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT PHENOMENONS I'VE EVER SEEN AND POLITICS. THEY SENT 3000 PEOPLE HOME. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. IT IS BEAUTIFUL WHAT IS HAPPENING. NEWT GINGRICH SAID HE'S NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. HE SAID IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. I SAID IT'S FINE, BUT IF I DON'T WIN, IT'S A WASTE OF TIME. HE SAYS WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS INCREDIBLE. YOU HAVE TOTALLY CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE FOR POLITICS.  DON'T APPLAUD. HE SAYS YOU HAVE TOTALLY CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE OF POLITICS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE YOUR CAMPAIGN. I SAID YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. IF I DON'T WIN, I WILL CONSIDER THIS A TOTAL AND COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. I REALLY DO BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING. I HAD CROWDS AND TRUMP RAN THIS RATHER GOOD CAMPAIGN. IF WE DON'T WIN, IT IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME. IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE ELSE IN THERE, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO. WHEN I SAY MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY, THEY ALL LAUGH. THESE ARE PEOPLE, THEY THINK IT IS FUNNY. THEY ARE MAKING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON DEFICITS THAT WE HAVE. THE WALL IS TENETS. THEY ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL. NOW THEY DON'T LAUGH BECAUSE THEY ARE STARTING TO AGREE WITH ME. THE OTHER DAY, TED CRUZ SAYS WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. AND MY WIFE IS SITTING -- WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM? HE'S A GOOD GUY BUT I THINK IT WAS ON FOX, HE SAID WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. THEY ARE ALL TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH ME BECAUSE WHEN I DID THIS STUFF, IT WAS OUT THERE. NOW, I'M THE ONE EVERYONE WANTS TO ASPIRE TO. SO TED IS UP AND HE IS TALKING. MY WIFE IS SITTING THERE AND SHE SAYS DARLING, DID YOU HEAR THAT? THAT'S THE FIRST TIME -- SHE HASN'T HEARD THAT FROM ANY OTHER CANDIDATE. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL AND MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT. WHEN I STARTED THE JOURNEY, IT WAS AMAZING. I WENT DOWN TO THE LOBBY OF TRUMP TOWER AND IT LOOKED LIKE THE ACADEMY AWARDS. WHEN I CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR, I SAID WE ARE GOING TO DO THINGS -- I MENTIONED ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. IT WASN'T EVEN ON THE RADAR. NOW IT'S ONE OF THE BIG SUBJECTS. ONE OF THE POLLS THAT CAME OUT -- CNN JUST CAME OUT WITH A POLL A WEEK AGO, 36 PERCENT FOR TRUMP. ON THE ECONOMY, THEY GIVE ME 55%. THAT'S WITH 16 PEOPLE AT THE TIME. THE BUDGET AND THE ECONOMY, I WHEN IT HANDS DOWN. BUT AT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, I'M ALMOST AT 50%. PEOPLE WANT TO BE PROTECTED. THEY NEED STRENGTH AND TOUGHNESS. I KNOW A LOT OF TOUGH GUYS AND THEY ARE NOT SMART. THEY ARE THE EASIEST. YOU HAVE TO BE SMART. YOU HAVE TO BE TOUGH BECAUSE THE WORLD IS TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US. THAT FIRST COUPLE OF WEEKS WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND THEN KATE WAS KILLED AND AN UNBELIEVABLE YOUNG MAN, JUST SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD. KATE WAS SHOT BY A GUY -- THESE ARE TOO. YOU HAVE THE ECONOMY AND THE JOBS BEING LOST AND ALL OF THIS STUFF. ALL OF THE SUDDEN, PEOPLE ARE COMING OVER AND NOW THEY ARE STARTING TO SAY THE WALL. WE HAVE TO BE PROGRESSIVE AND ARE THINKING. I MEAN SMART. I DON'T MEAN PROGRESSIVE LIKE BERNIE SANDERS. THINK OF IT. THIS GUY WANTS TO RAISE YOUR TAXES TO 90%. I LOVE THIS AREA. GREAT GOLFING AREA, AM I RIGHT? NO MORE GOLF IF BERNIE SANDERS -- YOU WON'T HAVE ANY GOLF ANYMORE. YOU WON'T HAVE ANY MONEY LEFT. THIS GUY IS A TOTAL DISASTER. HILLARY SAYS I WOULD LIKE TO RUN AGAINST TRUMP. BELIEVE ME, CHUCK TODD, MEET THE PRESS, HIS SHOW IS DYING. HE NEVER TREATED ME FAIRLY. HE GETS THE HIGHEST RATING HE'S HAD IN YEARS. I WON'T EVEN GIVE YOU THE NUMBERS. I SAVED HIS LIFE AND THEN HE GOES HILLARY CLINTON SAYS SHE WOULD MOST LIKE TO RUN AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. TRUST ME, THE LAST PERSON -- SHE HAD A TOUGH NIGHT LAST NIGHT. SHE HAD A TOUGH NIGHT LOOKING AT THE BEAUTY PAGEANT. HILLARY CLINTON SAID -- HERE IS CHUCK TODD. HE'S A NICE GUY. HE GOES THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN SAYS THEY WOULD MOST LIKE TO RUN AGAINST TRUMP LIKE I'M SOME KIND OF SAP. WHEN THEY SAY THEY WANT TO RUN AGAINST ME, THAT MEANS THEY DON'T WANT TO RUN AGAINST ME. IT IS REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY. THEY SAY THEY WANT TO RUN AGAINST ME. I'M WINNING AND TIED IN THE POLLS -- LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE GUYS I HIT -- THEY ARE GONZO OR THEY ARE FAILING BADLY. HILLARY CLINTON, THINK ABOUT IT. CHUCK, REPORTED PROPERLY. THEY DON'T WANT TO RUN AGAINST TRUMP. THE HUSBAND WANTS TO COME AND ACCUSE ME OF THINGS AND THE HUSBAND IS ONE OF THE GREAT ABUSERS OF THE WORLD? GIVE ME A BREAK. THE LAST PERSON SHE WANTS TO RUN AGAINST HIS ME. I WAS TALKING ABOUT TRADE, OBAMACARE AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT. THE SECOND AMENDMENT WILL BE SAVED, BY THE WAY. IT WILL BE SAVED. THE SECOND AMENDMENT WILL BE WITH US. THEY WANT TO GET RID OF BULLETS, THINK OF PARIS, THINK OF LOS ANGELES. THEY HAD NO GUNS. PARIS HAS THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE WORLD AND FRANCE, YOU GET CAUGHT WITH A GUN, THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS GUNS ARE BAD GUYS. THEY CALL THE GUY A MASTERMIND, BUT HE'S A MORE ON. THE FRENCH POLICE DID A GREAT JOB AND OUR LOS ANGELES LEAST DID A PHENOMENAL JOB. WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL -- THIS GUY WITH THE HAT, HE HAS A LOUSY HEAD OF HAIR BUT HE'S A STRONG GUY. WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF THEY HAD A GUN -- SO -- YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING? GET OVER HERE, 130 PEOPLE BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE SO BADLY INJURED. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO GAVE A PARTY IN HONOR OF THEIR MARRIAGE. THEY GAVE THEM A PARTY. SHE CAME ON A FIANCE PERMIT AND SHE WAS RADICALIZED AND HE WAS PROBABLY RADICALIZED I HER. PEOPLE KNEW THAT THEY WERE RADICALIZED AND PEOPLE IN THE AREA -- WHO THE HELL DOESN'T KNOW? AND THEY DID NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE TO REPORT THESE PEOPLE. NO MORE NONSENSE. THEY DID NOT REPORT THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T DISAGREE WITH THEM. GIVE ME A BREAK. WE HAVE TO CHANGE. I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT TRADE AND ALL OF THIS, BUT AFTER PARIS AND CALIFORNIA, AND THERE WILL BE OTHERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO FEAR OF US, IT HAS TOTALLY CHANGED AND MY POLL NUMBERS WENT UP 10 POINTS. THEY SAY PEOPLE VIEW YOU AS A TOUGH COOKIE. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS CRAFT. -- THIS CRAP.  NOW I TALK ABOUT SECTION. I'VE GOT THE GREATEST GUYS IN THE WORLD. I ALWAYS TALK ABOUT FORD. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITH ME. FORD IS CLOSING PLANTS ALL OVER MICHIGAN. HOW THE HELL DOES THAT HELP US? WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT IS GOOD FOR US? WE HAVE PLANTS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO SELL CARS AND PARTS -- FOUR WILL SAY YOU HAVE TO STAY IN THE UNITED STATES. IT'S VERY SIMPLE. HOW ABOUT NABISCO ANNOUNCED IN CHICAGO THEY ARE GOING TO LEAVE AND GO TO MEXICO. WE ARE NOT EATING OREOS ANYMORE. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE A PRODUCT AND SELL IT IN THE UNITED STATES? IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. WE DON'T GET ANYTHING OUT OF ANYTHING. THAT IRAN DEAL WAS A DISASTER. THIS CAME TO ME TWO WEEKS AGO. THE IRAN DEAL IS THE WORST DEAL I'VE EVER SEEN NEGOTIATED. WE GAVE THEM A RACK. THAT'S EVEN BETTER. WE GAVE IT RAN A RACK -- WE GAVE IRAN IRAQ. TAKE A LOOK. AMONG THE LARGEST OIL RESERVES IN THE WORLD. WE GAVE THEM BY DECAPITATING A RACK -- IRAQ, NOT ONLY DID THEY MAKE A GREAT DEAL, WE GAVE THEM IRAQ. NOW THEY HAVE THE LARGEST RESERVES IN THE WORLD. THAT'S EVEN BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. WHOEVER IS REPRESENTING IRAN IS DOING A HECK OF A JOB. WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE DEALS LIKE THAT WITH ME. WE ARE GOING TO BECOME RICH AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO BECOME SAFE AGAIN AND WE ARE GOING TO BECOME STRONG AGAIN.  AND YOU ARE GOING TO REMEMBER THIS MOMENT. IT'S GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR ALL OF US. GO OUT AND VOTE. IT IS GOING TO BE YOUR TURN. IT STARTS IN FEBRUARY 1 WITH IOWA. THREE WEEKS -- WE'VE GOT FOUR WEEKS TO GO -- NO MATTER WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE, YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND VOTE. DON'T GO SAY TRUMP IS GOING TO DO WELL. THE MORE WE CAN WIN BY, THE MORE POWER WE HAVE BECAUSE IT IS LIKE A MANDATE. IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR TO BE HERE, BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, I PROMISE. THANK YOU.  THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.  >>  WE ARE NOT DONE A TAKE IT, WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANY MORE      >>   WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT, NO, WE AIN'T GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE        >> WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT, WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE   ","Donald Trump Campaign Rally in Hilton Head, South Carolina"

THIS IS SO EXCITING. WE WILL DO QUESTIONS. WE ARE DOING REALLY WELL. IOWA HAS BEEN AMAZING. WE ARE DOING SO WELL AND I LOVE THIS PLACE. I'M BACK HERE ALL THE TIME AND I WILL BE HERE A LOT IN JANUARY.  YOU ARE GOING TO BE SO SICK OF ME. YOU ARE GOING TO SAY WE CANNOT GIVE HIM THE CAUCUS. NO, YOU ARE GOING TO LIKE ME AND WE ARE GOING TO DO A GREAT JOB FOR YOU. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE WILL GET TO THAT OFFICE AND DO THE RIGHT THING. WE'RE GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. SO, A FEW THINGS. SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED. WHEN WE FIRST CAME OUT, WE WERE ALL TALKING TOGETHER AND WE WERE TALKING BORDER SECURITY WHICH WE'RE DOING SO GREAT WITH. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A WALL. MEXICO WILL PAY FOR THE WALL. WE ALL KNOW THAT. WE WILL HAVE SECURITY. THE DRUGS WILL STOP. PEOPLE WILL COME INTO THE COUNTRY BUT COME IN AND BE LEGAL. THAT IS THE WAY. THAT IS THE WAY. IT AFFECTS IOWA SO MUCH. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT REPEALING OBAMACARE. IT WILL BE REPLACED.  I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE BEEN SEEING WHAT IS HAPPENING BUT OBAMACARE IS A TOTAL DISASTER. IT IS DYING OF ITS OWN WEIGHT. BY 2017, HE'LL BE PLAYING GOLF AND I WILL BE WORKING VERY HARD. BY 2017, INSTEAD, YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE PEOPLE SIGNED UP. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT IT. OBAMACARE IS DEAD. WE WILL COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WILL BE SO GOOD, SO MUCH BETTER. PREMIUMS ARE GOING THROUGH THE ROOF. DEDUCTIBLES OR SO IARE SO HIGH, THAT UNLESS YOU WERE CLOSE TO DEATH, I DON'T THINK YOU'D BE ABLE TO USE IT. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT. BY THE WAY, WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE. NOBODY IS REALLY -- WE HAVE THE PEOPLE.  I WAS HERE A MONTH AGO AND THEY DO A FANTASTIC JOB. IT IS SO IMPORTANT. IT IS ANOTHER FORM OF LET'S STAY AWAY FROM OPEC AND THE MIDDLE EAST STUFF. IT IS SO IMPORTANT. ACTUALLY, WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE THE ONE GUY THAT IS DOING PRETTY GOOD WITH ME IN IOWA IS TED CRUZ. EVERYTHING I SAY, HE AGREES WITH. NO MATTER WHAT I SAY. HE AGREES. WITH THE ETHANOL, HE HAS TO COME A LONG WAY BECAUSE HE IS FOR THE OIL. I UNDERSTAND OIL PAY SOME A LOT OF MONEY. THE OIL COMPANIES GIVE HIM A LOT OF MONEY. SO, I'M WITH YOU. I'M WITH EVERYBODY. LOOK, I'M SELF FUNDING. I HAVE NO OIL COMPANY, NO SPECIAL INTEREST. I HAVE NO LOBBYISTS THAT WANT ME. THEY ARE REPRESENTING COUNTRIES THAT ARE RIPPING OFF THE COUNTRY. THEY ARE REPRESENTING COMPANIES THAT ARE RIPPING OFF THE COUNTRY. I AM WORKING FOR YOU. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SO GREAT AGAIN.  AND MAYBE BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE. SO IMPORTANT. WHEN WE FIRST STARTED, I TALKED ABOUT CHINA AND JAPAN AND MEXICO. MEXICO BOTH AT THE BORDER AND IN TRADE. NBABISCO IS MOVING THERE. FORD IS MOVING THERE. THEY TOOK THE BIG PLANT AWAY FROM TENNESSEE, A GREAT STATE. WE WILL DO -- WE WILL GET IT. WE WILL DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO, OK? THANK YOU. LOOK AT THAT GROUP OVER THERE. I TALK ABOUT THAT A LOT. THE FACT IS THAT ABOUT 2.5 WEEKS AGO IN PARIS, I'M SPEAKING A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY NOW. I CAN TAKE CARE OF CHINA IN MY BACK POCKET. THAT IS EASY FOR ME. THAT IS WHAT I DO.  WE HAVE ALL THE CARDS. THESE POLITICIANS DO NOT UNDERSTAND. WE HAVE THE CARDS. WITH CHINA, OUR PEOPLE PAY TAX. THEY PAY NO TAX. THEY CALL IT A TARIFF BECAUSE IT SOUNDS BETTER. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT. WHAT HAPPENED IS WITH PARIS, IT IS A DIFFERENT MINDSET. WHEN THE POLLS CAME OUT LAST WEEK, MY NUMBERS WENT WAY UP BECAUSE PEOPLE FEEL MORE SECURE WITH ME. YEAH, REALLY.  WHO KNOWS WHY? WHO KNOWS? BUT, MY POLL NUMBERS WENT UP. WHENEVER THERE IS SOMETHING I DO THAT IS PROPER, BUT CONTROVERSIAL, THEY SAY NOW'S HE 'S DONE. THAT'S IT. THAT IS THE END. I WILL NOT GO OVER ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE MAYBE YOU WILL CHANGE YOUR MIND. THEY WILL SAY THAT IS IT. IT IS OVER. AND THEN THEY COME AND SAY, SIR, YOUR POLL NUMBERS WENT UP NINE POINTS THIS WEEK. THEY DID?  BECAUSE I HAVE TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT. I HAVE TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT? IF I DON'T MAKE IT, I DON'T MAKE IT. I HAVE A GOOD LIFE. YOU ALL HOPEFULLY HAVE A GOOD LIFE. I HAVE A GREAT FAMILY, NICE PEOPLE. THEY LOVE ME, I THINK, I HOPE. I THINK. BUT, I HAVE A GREAT FAMILY. I BUILT A GREAT BUSINESS. THANK YOU. WHO IS THAT PERSON? I LOVE THAT PERSON. STAND UP. I LOVE THAT PERSON. THANK YOU, DARLING. I APPRECIATE IT. THERE IS SUCH SPIRIT NO MATTER WHERE I GO. WE GO TO DALLAS, WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. 35,000 PEOPLE IN ALABAMA. 20,000 PEOPLE IN OKLAHOMA. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE A RECORD. IT IS BIG, YET IT FEELS INTIMATE. WE ARE GOING TO START TAKING QUESTIONS. I JUST WANT TO SAY -- I CHANGED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. WHEN I SAW PARIS, I CHANGED. AND A BIG PART OF WHAT I'M DOING NOW IS SAFETY AND SECURITY AND SMARTNESS AND SMARTNESS.  IT IS INTERESTING. IT IS TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AND SAFE AGAIN BECAUSE WE DON'T FEEL SAFE ANYMORE. THE PROBLEM WE HAVE NOW THAT WE NEVER HAD TO THIS EXTENT IS THE POWER OF WEAPONRY. IT IS THE POWER, THE TREMENDOUS POWER. 100 YEARS AGO, I SAID DO NOT GO THERE ANYWAY -- I SAID DO NOT GO. YOU WILL DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST. THE FACT IS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO DO THINGS BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME REALLY, REALLY SICK THE DEGENERATES. AND THE PRESS -- LOOK AT ALL THE CAMERAS GOING. NOBODY ELSE HAS CAMERAS LIKE THIS. 100 TIMES I MAKE A SPEECH, NOBODY CARES. LOOK AT THIS.  AND, DON'T WORRY. THEY HAVE ME. THAT IS WHY I'M WALKING AROUND. THEY NEVER PAN THE CROWD. THEY NEVER DO. MY WIFE, I HAD A CROWD OF 7000 PEOPLE LAST WEEK -- MORE -- 7000 PEOPLE IN A CAN FINDONFINED SPACE. MY WIFE SAID THE SPEECH WAS EXCELLENT. DID YOU HAVE MANY PEOPLE THERE? I SAID WHAT? SHE SAID THEY NEVER LEAVE YOUR FACE. I FIGURED THE CAMERAS WERE SCREWED UP WHERE YOU COULD NOT MOVE IT. ANYTIME THERE IS A PROTESTER, AND THEY COULD BE IN THE BACK CORNER OF THE ROOM, THE CAMERAS SWOOP OVER THERE. IT IS TRUE. IT IS TRUE.  NO, I USED TO THINK THEY COULD NOT MOVE. THEY'RE CONNECTED WITH THE CRAZY COMPUTERS. IN THE ALL DAYS, EVERYTHING WAS BETTER. THE CAR SEATS -- HE WOULD SIT IN YOUR CAR, YOU WANT TO MOVE FORWARD OR BACK, YOU PRESS A BUTTON. NOW YOU HAVE TO OPEN UP THINGS AND PRESS A COMPUTER. THE SAME THING WITH CAMERAS. I DIDN'T THINK THEY MOVED. I FIGURED THEY WERE FIXED. THEN, I SAW A PROTESTER AND THOSE CAMERAS WERE BENT IN POSITIONS LIKE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED POSSIBLE. THEY ARE VERY DISHONEST PEOPLE. NOT ALL OF THEM, BUT MOST OF THEM. THE PRESS IS -- YOU HAVE ONE OF THE MOST DISHONEST IN YOUR BACKYARD. ""THE DES MOINES REGISTER"" IS THE WORST.  THE WORST. THE WORST. NO, THEY'RE VERY DISHONEST. YOU HAVE SOME REPORTER NAMED JACOBS. SHE IS THE WORST. SHE WILL WRITE SO -- IT IS SUCH MISREPRESENTATION. I DON'T CARE. I'M SAYING IN THEIR BACKYARD. THEY ARE FAILING ANYWAY. THEY PROBABLY WILL NOT BE IN BUSINESS IN TWO YEARS. IT IS FUNNY, EVERY TIME ""THE DES MOINES REGISTER"" DOES A POLL, I ALWAYS DO BADLY. I BELIEVE -- I'M ONLY DOING THIS SO THEY DON'T SUE ME -- I HOPE THEY DO BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO SUE ME. I BELIEVE, AND I MAY BE WRONG, I WILL SAY I'M SURE I'M WRONG, BUT IT IS MY OPINION THAT THEY DON'T DO IT PROPERLY. BECAUSE THEY PULL LIKE 300 TO 400 PEOPLE, BUT I BELIEVE -- IF THEY LOSE 20 PEOPLE. FORGET THAT ONE. I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY DO THAT. DO YOU DO THAT? EVERY TIME I HAVE A ""DDES MOINES REGISTER"" POLL, I DO POORLY. WE HAD A GREAT POLL COMING FROM CNN WHERE WE ARE LEADING BY 13 POINTS IN IOWA.  THEN, WE HAD ANOTHER ONE WHERE WE ARE DOING VERY WELL. I THINK ""DES MOINES REGISTER"" -- JUST WATCH. TRUMP DISAPPEARS. I THINK WE WILL DO SO WELL. I THINK WE WILL ACTUALLY DO BETTER. WE ARE LEADING IN MOST OF THE POLLS. WE ARE LEADING IN EVERY POLL, EXCEPT IOWA, THERE WAS ONE POLL. MONMOUTH, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? EXPLAIN IT. I DON'T LIKE IT BECAUSE THEY'LL WE TREAT ME BADLY ALSO. I ONLY LIKE POLLS THAT TREAT ME WELL, RIGHT? BUT, WE ARE DOING SO WELL. NATIONWIDE, WE ARE LEADING EVERY POLL BY TREMENDOUS. WE HAD ONE IN GEORGIA -- 44%. THINK OF THAT. THAT IS 44% WITH 15 PEOPLE. I'D TAKE 44% IF WE HAD THREE PEOPLE. BUT, 44%. CBS CAME OUT, AS YOU KNOW, ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"" A FEW DAYS AGO -- 35%. WE ARE KILLING EVERYBODY IN EVERY POLL. WHEN DES MOINES COMES OUT, I 'M SURE IT WILL BE NEGATIVE. WE ARE GOING TO WIN. HONESTLY, IOWA IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME. I COULD SAY LET'S NOT -- I'M AN EVANGELICAL, A CHRISTIAN, A PRESBYTERIAN.  I LOVE BILLY GRAHAM. HE CAME OUT WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL STATEMENTS. HE WAS SO INCREDIBLE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THIS. HE CANNOT WITH STATEMENTS ABOUT  -- CAME OUT WITH STATEMENTS ABOUT TRUMP. STAND UP. IS THAT RIGHT? HE WAS SO INCREDIBLE. FRANKLIN GRAHAM, THE SON OF BILLY GRAHAM. BILLY GRAHAM WAS UNBELIEVABLE. THEY WERE INCREDIBLE. SO, I THINK WE WILL DO -- WE ARE DOING REALLY WELL WITH EVANGELICALS. BY THE WAY, I DO LIKE TED CRUZ, BUT NOT A LOT OF EVANGELICALS, OUT OF CUBA -- COME OUT OF CUBA. NOT A LOT COME OUT. I LIKE HIM NEVERTHELESS. WE ARE DOING GREAT WITH EVANGELICALS. WE ARE DOING GREAT WITH THE TEA PARTY. LEADING WITH THE TEA PARTY.  AND WE ARE DOING FANTASTIC WITH OLD AND YOUNG AND MIDDLE. WE ARE DOING GREAT WITH EVERYBODY. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME TO WIN IOWA. I COULD PUT LESS PRESSURE ON MYSELF AND I COULD SAY I DON'T CARE ABOUT IOWA, BUT I DO CARE. I DO CARE SO MUCH ABOUT IT. THAT IS WHY AM HERE ALL THE TIME. THEN LIES HAPPEN. THEY LIE SO MUCH. THE PEOPLE OF IOWA CAN'T BE THAT STUPID. THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY -- I'M TRYING TO MAKE A POINT. I SAID THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY CANNOT BE THAT STUPID. THEY CUT THE COUNTRY OUT. IOWA, I LOVE YOU PEOPLE. REMEMBER THAT.  I WAS TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING AND I WON'T EVEN MENTION WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THE GUY I WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD GUIDE, BUT I WILL SAY THIS, WE WANT TO WIN IOWA SO BAD. IF I WIN, I THINK WE RUN THE TABLE. I THINK WE RUN THE TABLE.  WE GO RIGHT THROUGH IT. BIG IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, EVERY POLL. CHRISTIE GOT AN ENDORSEMENT FROM THIS CRAZY NEWSPAPER UP THERE. THE WEIRDEST DEAL I HAVE EVER SEEN. YOU KNOW, THE PAPER THAT WAS IN HIS STATE CALLED UP AND SAID ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? NOBODY EVER CALLED US. CAN'T BELIEVE IT. WE COULD GO INTO THAT BUT IT IS NOT RELEVANT. WE ARE LEADING NEW HAMPSHIRE BIG. WE ARE LEADING IN SOUTH CAROLINA, LIKE MONSTROUS NUMBERS. WE ARE LEADING NEVADA, TEXAS. WE ARE LEADING EVERYWHERE. WE ARE LEADING BIG IN FLORIDA. YOU HAVE RUBIO, NICE GUY -- BUT, WHEN THE PEOPLE PUT YOU IN POSITION TO BE A SENATOR, YOU HAVE TO GO VOTE. YOU CANNOT BE THE NUMBER ONE PERSON WHO DOES NOT VOTE IN THE SENATE. YOU HAVE TO SAY HEY, I WANT TO GO AND VOTE. HE SHOULD STAY THERE A LITTLE LONGER. GO IN VOTE, CREATE A NICE RECORD. BUT, I DON'T KNOW. HOW IS HE DOING IN IOWA? NOT TOO GOOD. NOT GOOD. IT SEEMS LIKE A TWO-PERSON RACE RIGHT NOW. IT IS AN IMPORTANT RACE TO ME. WITH ALL OF THAT, IF WE WIN IOWA, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WE WIN VIRTUALLY EVERY STATE IN THE UNION AND IT IS OVER QUICKLY.  NOW, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE QUESTIONS. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WILL BE ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT? THEY HAVE A PROBLEM. IT IS SORT OF LIKE THE FIGHTERS. THE GREAT CHAMPIONS. SOMETIMES THEY GO TO THE HOMETOWN OF THE GUY THEY ARE FIGHTING AND THEY WILL SAY WE NEVER WANT TO GET A DECISION, WE GO FOR THE KNOCKOUT. BECAUSE YOU GET A LOT OF BAD POSITIONS. THEY GO INTO A HOMETOWN TO FIGHT AND IT IS A DECISION. THEY SAY WE ARE IN A PROBLEM. THEY LOSE THE FIGHT THAT THEY WON. THE ONLY WAY THEY WIN THE FIGHT DEFINITELY, KNOCKOUT. IF WE WIN IOWA, THINK WE WILL WIN EVERYTHING AFTER THAT. IT WILL SHOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. I WILL PLEDGE OF THIS TO IOWA EVEN IF I LOSE. I DON'T THINK I HAVE EVER SAID THAT IN MY LIFE. BUT, IF WE GO AND WIN, IOWA IS STAYING WHERE IT IS IN THE CHAIN. IT IS NOT MOVING.  THERE IS A BIG MOVE FOR US TO MOVE IOWA INTO A MUCH FURTHER BACK POSITION BY THE ESTABLISHMENT. FOLKS, I WIN, IT IS NOT HAPPENING. YOU ARE STAYING RIGHT HERE. IT'S GREAT.  YOU KNOW, IT IS GREAT. IF I DON'T DO THAT, TANA WILL BE VERY ANGRY AT ME. IS SHE INCREDIBLE?  THANK YOU. THE WHOLE STAFF. CHUCK AND STEPHANIE, WHERE IS MY BIG I? GUY? HOW GOOD IS HE ON TELEVISION? WHERE THE HELL IS HE? BIG SAM, COME HERE.  LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THEM. COME HERE, SAM. LOOK AT HIM. BIG SAM. COME HERE. ARE WE GOING TO WIN?  BEAUTIFUL. BE CAREFUL. HE DID SO WELL, I DON'T WANT HIM FALLING WHEN HE IS LEAVING. BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU, SAM. THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. I WILL BE HERE THAT NIGHT. THAT WEEK AND A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE. I WILL WATCH YOU. I WILL NOT GIVE YOU ANY CHANCE THAT WE LOSE THIS. LET'S TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS. WE WILL HAVE A LITTLE FUN. WE DID A BIG INTERVIEW WITH CNN BEFORE THIS. WITH HILLARY MISSING TODAY -- SHE WAS TWO HOURS LATE. DID YOU HEAR?  I MAY BE WRONG. IF I AM ONE MINUTE OFF, THEY WILL CALL ME BECAUSE THEY LOVE HILLARY. YOU KNOW WHY? I DON'T KNOW WHY. SHE WAS A COUPLE OF HOURS LATE AND EVERYBODY LEFT. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? SHE WAS SLEEPING. SHE COULD NOT GET OUT OF BED. SHE WAS SLEEPING IS RIGHT. LET'S TAKE SOME QUESTIONS.  HI.  I'M GLAD YOU ASKED ME THAT QUESTION. YOU HAVE BEEN PAYING INTO SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE, BY THE WAY. MEDICARE DOES WORK. THERE IS TREMENDOUS WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE. WE WILL NOT CUT YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY AND YOUR MEDICARE. WE WILL TAKE THE JOBS BACK FROM ALL THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE RIPPING US OFF. WE WILL BECOME A WEALTHY COUNTRY AGAIN AND SAVE YOU SOCIAL SECURITY. THINK OF IT -- I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS NUMBER, BUT WHO WAS THE MANDATORY THE NUMBER? OVER 6 MILLION PEOPLE -- I CANNOT BELIEVE IT -- ARE AGE 112 AND OVER AND GETTING SOCIAL SECURITY. WHO IS THE MAN THAT TOLD ME THAT? I HEARD IT, I READ IT. 6 MILLION PEOPLE ARE GETTING SOCIAL SECURITY, MEETING SOMEONE ELSE IS PICKING IT UP. WHO IS THAT MAN? HE IS OVER THERE SOMEPLACE. OK. 6 MILLION PEOPLE MORE. HE CAME UP TO ME TONIGHT. IT IS AN AMAZING STATISTIC. WE WILL HAVE TO CHECK IT. CAN YOU IMAGINE -- WE KNOW THERE MAY BE ONE MILLION BUT NOT 6 MILLION. ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM 112 OR OVER? IF THEY ARE, THE WANT TO SHAKE YOUR HAND -- I WANT TO SHAKE YOUR HAND. 6 MILLION PEOPLE OVER 112 YEARS OLD PICKING UP SOCIAL SECURITY. THERE IS TREMENDOUS WASTE. WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS SAVE MEDICARE, SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO RAISE THE AGE AND DO ALL THE THINGS THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS TALKING ABOUT DOING. THEY ARE ALL TALKING ABOUT DOING IT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO. WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR JOBS BACK. WE WILL MAKE THE ECONOMY INCREDIBLE AGAIN. MY TAX PROPOSAL WHICH IS IN GREAT DETAIL IN TERMS OF POLICY AND HAS GOTTEN TREMENDOUS REVIEWS FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE. BUT, WE ARE GOING TO CUT TAXES TREMENDOUSLY FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND BUSINESSES, BECAUSE THE MIDDLE CLASS, OUR MIDDLE-CLASS IS BEING DECIMATED. SUE, WHEN THAT HAPPENS, YOU WILL SEE AN ECONOMY THAT TAKES OFF. WE WILL GET RID OF A LOT OF THAT DEBT. WE ARE $19 TRILLION GOING TO $21 TRILLION RIGHT NOW. IF YOU GO BACK EIGHT OR NINE YEARS, TRILLION WAS NOT A WORD ANYBODY KNEW AND NOW IT IS ROUTINE. WE ARE GOING TO SAVE YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY WITHOUT CUTS. WE WILL MAKE OURSELVES RICH AGAIN. A WOMAN SAID TO ME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, SHE SAID, I'M VOTING FOR YOU, I LOVE YOU, BUT IT IS VERY CRUDE WHEN YOU SAY YOU WILL MAKE THE COUNTRY WHICH AGAIN. I SAID I KNOW IT SOUNDS THAT, BUT MANY THINGS I SAY ARE CRUDE. WE CANNOT MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN UNLESS WE MAKE OUR COUNTRY RICH AGAIN. WE CANNOT LET EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD RIP US OFF.  REMEMBER, WE BUILT CHINA. THE MONEY THEY TOOK OUT OF OUR COUNTRY, WE REBUILT CHINA. THEY HAVE BRIDGES ALL OVER. THEY HAVE BRIDGES LIKE THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE. MAYBE I SHOULD NOT MENTION THAT ONE PARTICULARLY. BIGGER THAN THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE. ONLY A FEW PEOPLE GOT THAT. THEY HAVE BRIDGES GOING UP. WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA. THEY HAVE TAKEN OUR JOBS, FAITH, MANUFACTURING. THEY HAVE TAKEN OUR MONEY. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE, FOLKS. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.  I KNOW THE GREAT BUSINESSPEOPLE. WE HAVE THE GREATEST BUSINESSPEOPLE IN THE WORLD. GUYS LIKE CARL ICAHN. HE CALLS ME SAYING HE WANTS TO HELP. WE ARE NOT GOING TO USE SPECIAL INTERESTS. WE USE DONORS TO NEGOTIATE WITH CHINA BECAUSE HE GAVE SOME GUY, WHOEVER IT MIGHT BE -- AGAIN, I'M THE ONLY ONE CELL FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN. -- SELF FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN. WHEN THESE GUYS GIVE MONEY TO POLITICIANS, TO A LARGE EXTENT, THEY OWN THOSE POLITICIANS. THEY WILL DO WHATEVER THE HELL THE SPECIAL INTERESTS AND DONORS WANT. SOCIAL SECURITY, WE ARE SAVING IT. MEDICARE, WE ARE SAVING IT. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE HER COUNTRY RICH. THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.  HI.  AM I GOOD WITH THE VETERANS?  WE ARE LEADING WITH THE VETERANS BY LIKE -- FORGET IT.  YES, IT IS CALLED --  WHAT I LIKE ABOUT JEFF, HE STARTED OFF WEAK, BUT FINISH STRONGED STRONG. THAT WAS A LONG ROUTE TO GET TO A GOOD QUESTION. YEAH, IT IS CALLED THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, RIGHT? IT IS A SIX-YEAR STATUTE. MAYBE FIVE. YEAH, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT. HILLARY CLINTON -- YOU KNOW THE STORY. IT IS A CRIME. SHE COMMITTED A CRIME. NOW, PERHAPS, PERHAPS -- WE HAVE TO HAVE A FAIR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. AND PERHAPS JEFF WILL HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT WILL SAY -- LOOK, WE WANT TO BE FAIR WITH EVERYBODY, INCLUDING HILLARY CLINTON, BUT SHE COMMITTED A CRIME. SHE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO RUN. SHE IS BEING PROTECTED. I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT THEY WILL FIND ANYTHING, BUT THEY HAVE ALREADY FOUND IT. WHEN YOU WATCH TELEVISION, YOU HAVE THESE BIG SCHOLARS, LAWYERS -- YES, SHE VIOLATED SECTIONS OH AND SO AND SO. MANY MANYNY, MANY LAWS. YOU MENTIONED THE GENERAL. HIS LIFE WAS OVER DESTROYED OVER NOTHING. I THINK SHE WILL BE THEIR NOMINEE. THE ONLY QUESTION IS IF SHE WILL BE ALLOWED TO RUN. SHE IS BEING PROTECTED BY THE DEMOCRATS, BY THE PRESIDENT. WHY DO YOU THINK SHE IS GOING ALONG WITH THESE INSANE POLICIES OF HIS? SHE GOES ALONG WITH EVERYTHING. HONESTLY IN FAIRNESS TO HER, I DON'T THINK SHE BELIEVES IT. BUT I THINK SHE IS AFRAID HE IS GOING TO SAY, I DON'T LIKE HER ANYMORE. I WILL GET SOMEBODY ELSE. I'M TELLING YOU. SO, THE QUESTION OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS -- IT IS A FIVE-YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. SHE HAS A PROBLEM. IN ONE WAY, SHE IS RUNNING FOR HER LIFE BECAUSE I KNOW ONE THING -- IF SHE WINS, THAT IS THE END OF THAT. IF SHE LOSES, SHE COULD HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM. ANOTHER QUESTION, PLEASE.  HI.  IT IS ALWAYS EXCITING.   OUT. OUT. GET HIM OUT.  GET HIM OUT. GET HIM OUT.   USA, USA, USA.  THAT IS A HILLARY SUPPORTER. YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS SAY IT -- A SINGLE PERSON ALWAYS WANT TO BE RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE CAMERA. STANDS UP, HE IS GONE IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES. TOMORROW, THE HEADLINES WILL BE PROTESTS. WE HAVE LIKE 2000 PEOPLE HERE. THE HEADLINE WILL BE THIS -- WAIT, THIS PERSON.  SORRY. YOU KNOW, IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH. I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE. I HAVE NEVER BEEN A POLITICIAN. I HATE BEING A POLITICIAN. I KNOW POLITICIAN SO MUCH. IF YOU CANNOT MAKE MONEY WITH POLITICIANS, THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG. IT IS AMAZING. I SEE THESE PEOPLE AND SOMETIMES -- I HAVE HAD 20,000 PEOPLE. NOT EVEN A MURMUR, JUST LOVE. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, YOU HAVE SOMEBODY STAND UP. EVERY SINGLE TIME IT TURNS OUT TO BE A BIG STORY. IT IS A SHAME. THAT IS THE PRESS ALSO.  WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE ANOTHER ONE STAND UP AT SOME POINT.  I SAID AT THE BEGINNING WE WILL BUILD A WALL. IT IS GOING TO BE A REAL WALL. NOT GOING TO BE -- YOU SEE THAT FEELING? -- CEILING. THAT IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE WALL. WE CAN BUILD IT, WE CAN BUILD IT RIGHT. IT WILL BE STRONG AND POWERFUL AND AS BEAUTIFUL AS A WALL COULD LOOK. IT HAS TO BE BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE SOMEDAY THEY WILL NAME IT THE TRUMP WALL.  IT IS GOING TO WORK. WALLS DO WORK. THEY WANTED TO BUILD A WALL 20 YEARS AGO. THEY COULD NOT GET ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENTS. CHINA IS BUILDING IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA MASSIVE MILITARY BASES. WHY? THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO. THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR OBAMA, OUR COUNTRY. THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THIS. WE CAN GET THEM TO STOP BY SAYING WE WILL NOT DO BUSINESS WITH YOU ANYMORE. WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO WAR. IT IS ECONOMICS. THE WHOLE COUNTRY WOULD COLLAPSE IN TWO SECONDS. WE HAVE SUCH POWER AND WE DON'T KNOW IT. THEY ARE BUILDING MASSIVE -- NOW, THEY HAVE LITTLE ISLANDS. THEY BUT THEPUT THE BIGGEST EXCAVATORS. I SAID TO A FRIEND OF MINE FROM CHINA, VERY RICH AND SUCCESSFUL -- HE PAID ME A FORTUNE SO I HAPPEN TO LIKE HIM. I SAID JOKINGLY, HOW LONG DID IT TAKE THEM TO BUILD THESE MASSIVE VIOLENCE? ISLANDS. ? HOW LONG DID IT TAKE THEM TO GET THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT? HE SAID NOTHING. THEY SAID THEY WILL BUILD THERE AND THEY WERE DIGGING TWO SECONDS LATER. WE HAVE A PROBLEM -- I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER. I'M A BIG BELIEVER. I HAVE GOTTEN SO MANY AWARDS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW WE'RE IMPINGED -- THE WALL WAS STOPPED BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT GET AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT. AMONG OTHER THINGS. THERE WAS PROBABLY A SNAIL OR TURTLE OR SNAKE OR SOMETHING. YOU ARE RUINING THE HABITAT OF A RATTLESNAKE. I DON'T KNOW. THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE, PEOPLE THAT WOULD NOW BE AGAINST IT, BUT THEY WANTED TO BUILD A WALL YEARS AGO. I SAID BOMB THE OIL. I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT FOR YEARS. NOW THEY ARE. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE DID NOT BOMB THE OIL, OBAMA DID NOT WANT TO HURT THE ENVIRONMENT. I HEARD THAT AND I THOUGHT SOMEBODY WAS KIDDING. I THOUGHT A COMEDIAN WAS SAYING THAT. IT TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE. HE DIDN'T WANT IT GOING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. THIS IS THE WAY WE FIGHT TODAY. I'M TELLING YOU, WE ARE BEING LED BY STUPID PEOPLE. WE ARE BEING LE BY STUPID D BY STUPID PEOPLE.  I SAID, I HAVE BEEN SAYING TAKE THE OIL. I DIDN'T WANT TO GO INTO IRAQ, BUT ONCE WE WERE THERE -- WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THERE, BUT WE LEFT THE WRONG WAY. FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO TOLD HIM A DATE. IT WAS LIKE 18 MONTHS LATER. THEY SAID WOW, DON'T BELIEVE IT. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE KILLED. THE ENEMY SAID THEY WOULD LEAVE ON A CERTAIN DATE? THE PULLED BACK AND THEN NOW YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED. IT IS A DISASTER AND IRAN IS TAKING OVER IRAQ. WHEN WE SENT 50 SOLDIERS WEEKS AGO AND THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES WE ARE SENDING 50 SOLDIERS. HE THINKS IT IS A GOOD PRESS ANNOUNCEMENT. IT IS NOT. 50 SOLDIERS IS NOT A LOT EVEN IF THEY ARE ELITE. THOSE 50 SOLDIERS, BECAUSE OF THAT ANNOUNCEMENT, HAVE A TARGET ON THEIR HEART. WHY DOES HE HAVE TO SAY THAT? WHY CAN'T HE LET 50 SOLDIERS GO THERE QUIETLY? STEALTH. WHY CAN'T HE JUST DO THAT?  WHY CAN'T HE DO THAT? THOSE 50 SOLDIERS ARE IN GRAVE DANGER TODAY BECAUSE OF THAT. AND, THEY PROBABLY DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT, BUT EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR THEM. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. WE STILL HAVE GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR, GENERAL GEORGE PATTON -- THESE WERE REAL PEOPLE.  TODAY, WE HAVE GENERALS THAT GO ON TALK SHOWS. I SAW A GENERAL THE OTHER DAY ON A TALK SHOW. HE SAID -- THIS IS SERIOUS. THEY ARE GOOD MEN, BUT YOU HAVE TO LEAD THESE MEN. THE GENERALS, YOU HAVE TO HAVE POWER OVER THEM. HE SAID WE ARE IN THE WORST SHAPE IN TERMS OF PREPAREDNESS THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN FOR DECADES . THIS IS THE TIME WHERE WE HAVE TO BE IN THE BEST SHAPE BECAUSE THE WORLD WANTS TO KILL US. THEY SAID WE ARE IN THE WORSHIP WE HAVE BEEN IN MANY DECADES -- WORST SHAPE WE HAVE BEEN IN MANY DECADES. HE SHOULD NOT BE SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE TELLING THE ENEMY THAT. THE ENEMY FEELS EMBOLDENED, RIGHT? WE SHOULD NOT BE SAYING IT.  EVEN IF IT IS TRUE, YOU DON'T SAY IT. YOU DO THE OPPOSITE. ONE THING I WILL DO -- I WILL BUILD THE MILITARY SO BIG AND SO STRONG AND SO POWERFUL THAT -- SO POWERFUL --  THAT NOBODY IS GOING TO MESS WITH US. NOBODY WILL MESS WITH US. IN MANY WAYS, IT IS THE CHEAPEST THING YOU CAN DO. EVERYBODY IS TOYING WITH US RIGHT NOW. IT IS THE ABSOLUTE CHEAPEST THING YOU CAN DO. OK, COME ON.  HI.  YOU ARE RIGHT. I'M A BIG SECOND AMENDMENT PERSON, BY THE WAY.  COME HERE. GET OVER HERE. MY GUNMAN. THIS GUY, HE HAS ONE OF THE GREAT PLACES. MIGHT AS WELL GIVE HIM FREE PUBLICITY. MY SON BUYS WEAPONS FROM HIM. MY SON AND I ARE MEMBERS OF THE NRA. COME HERE.  LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY WAS AIMING AT HIM. YOU KNOW, MY SONS, RIGHT? THEY ARE SERIOUS BELIEVERS IN THE GUNS. WHAT IS THE NAME INTERCOMPANY -- NAME OF YOUR COMPANY?  YOU HAVE A GREAT COMPANY. THIS IS LONG BEFORE I WAS EVER THINKING ABOUT DOING THIS, RIGHT?  THEY MAKE YOU A LOT OF MONEY? I HOPE THEY NEGOTIATED A LITTLE BIT. IT IS A GREAT COMPANY. THANK YOU. BE CAREFUL.  MY SON IS A REALLY GREAT MARKSMAN. I'M A MEMBER OF THE NRA, BUT NOT SUCH A GOOD SHOT. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT QUESTION -- SO, YOU KNOW THERE IS TREMENDOUS PRESSURE TO GET RID OF THE GUNS, THE MAGAZINES, THE BULLETS. I WILL THE THREE BULLETS IN EVERY MAGAZINE, THEN 12 AND THEN 23. I DON'T THINK THE BAD GUYS WILL SAY I DON'T WANT TO BREAK THE LAW, BUT I WILL PUT THREE BULLETS IN. THESE PEOPLE. I HAVE ARGUMENTS WITH THEM ALL THE TIME. I'M A PRACTICAL GUY. IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT, I COULD NOT SAY IT. IN FRANCE OR IN CALIFORNIA -- I HAVE PERMISSION TO CARRY WHICH IS A BIG THING IN NEW YORK. I HAVE A LICENSE TO CARRY. BUT, IN FRANCE OR CALIFORNIA OR ALL THESE PLACES WE HAVE SEEN SHOOTERS, IF INSTEAD OF HAVING HUNDREDS LIKE IN FRANCE, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM -- PARIS AS THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE WORLD. FRANCE HAS THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS IN THE WORLD. NOBODY HAS GUNS EXCEPT THE BAD GUYS. THEY WALKED IN WITH THE WORST, TOUGHEST, BEST BEST WEAPONRY YOU CAN HAVE AND THEY SAID OVER HERE, BOOM. OVER HERE, BOOM. THEY KILL 128 BUT MANY MORE ARE DYING RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE IN TERRIBLE SHAPE IN THE HOSPITALS. THEY WIPED THE PLACE OUT AND THEY COULD HAVE STAYED THERE LONGER. YOU HAVE THOSE TWO SLEAZE BAGS FROM CALIFORNIA, THE MARRIED COUPLE. A YOUNG MARRIED COUPLE DID THE SHOOTING. THEY ARE NOT A YOUNG MARRIED COUPLE. THEY ARE THE WORST. THEY ARE SLEAZE.  THEY SAY THE YOUNG MARRIED COUPLE. THAT IS NO YOUNG MARRIED COUPLE. THEY WALK INTO A PLACE AND THEY KILLED 14 PEOPLE AND OTHERS ARE GOING TO BE DYING PROBABLY. IF SOMEBODY HAD GUNS -- NOBODY HAD A GUN. LOOK AT THIS GUY RIGHT HERE. STAND UP. HOW WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IF YOU HAD A GUN? WOULD YOU FIRE BACK A LITTLE BIT? THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN TROUBLE. BELIEVE ME. THAT GUY.  YOU KNOW, I WENT TO AN IVY LEAGUE COLLEGE AND HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS. I ARGUE WITH THEM. I SAY, OK, WE'RE IN PARIS. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE AND YOU HAVE NO GUN. DON'T YOU THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER? THEY LOSE THE ARGUMENT, BUT THEY NEVER CHANGE THEIR MIND. WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT. IT IS SO SIMPLE. IT'S SO SIMPLE.  BELIEVE ME -- BELIEVE ME, THEY WANT TO TAKE THOSE GUNS AWAY AND YOU ALWAYS KNOW THE BAD ONES WILL HAVE THE GUNS AND HAVE IT MORE SO THAN EVER BEFORE SO WE WILL PROTECT THE SECOND AMENDMENT IF I'M PRESIDENT.  BY THE WAY, WE WILL ALSO BE SAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN.  DO YOU EVER NOTICE -- DO YOU EVER NOTICE --  THAT'S RIGHT, BRAD. MERRY CHRISTMAS. BY THE WAY, MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY. AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS. I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS THAT AREN'T CHRISTIAN. THEY LIKE CHRISTMAS. EVERYBODY LIKES CHRISTMAS. IT IS POLITICALLY INCORRECT TO SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS ANYMORE. WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY HOLIDAYS, ENJOY YOURSELVES. WE ARE GOING TO SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR COUNTRY, BRING THAT SPIRIT BACK. GO AHEAD.  HE IS A GOOD GUY.  THAT SECOND IS INTERESTING. I LIKE TED CRUZ A LOT. HE IS DOING WELL, I'M DOING WELL. IT IS NOT A CONTEST BETWEEN THE TWO OF US. I DO LIKE AM. HIM. I WOULD SAY WE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE THINGS IN MIND FOR TED. HE IS SOMEONE I CAN CERTAINLY SAY THAT FOR.  I LIKE HIM, HE LIKES ME. HE PUT OUT A TWEET TONIGHT AND SAID DONALD TRUMP IS TERRIFIC. THAT IS A NICE WORD. OTHER CANDIDATES ARE NOT EXACTLY SAYING THAT ABOUT ME. WILL YOU SAY HELLO TO PHYLLIS FOR ME? SHE IS AN AMAZING WOMAN.  GREAT QUESTION. THE SUPER PACS ARE HORRIBLE. I HAVE HAD MANY SET UP FOR ME FROM PEOPLE I DO NOT KNOW. SOME PEOPLE CALLED IT THE ART OF THE DEAL PAC. I STARTED GOING AROUND AND SEE THE CORRUPTION WITH THE SUPER PACS, WHERE THEY ARE STUFFED WITH MONEY. PEOPLE THAT PUT THE MONEY IN OUR DEALING WITH CANDIDATES. THE WHOLE THING IS WRONG. I SEE IT. BUSH HAS $125 MILLION. IF HE HAD $2 BILLION, IT WOULD NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE, OK?  BUSH HAS $125 MILLION -- HONESTLY, HE IS A NICE PERSON. HE IS A VERY NICE PERSON, BUT $125 MILLION. YOU SAY TO YOURSELF, PEOPLE GIVE $2 MILLION, $7 MILLION -- YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. SOME OF THE SUPER PACS ARE ACTUALLY RUNNING THE CAMPAIGN. ANOTHER THING THAT IS INTERESTING -- ONE OF THE SUPER PACS HAS $6 MILLION. OF THE $6 MILLION -- THIS WAS REPORTED ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE ""LOS ANGELES TIMES"" -- ONE OF THE CANDIDATES WHICH I WILL NOT MENTION THE NAME. OF THE $6 MILLION, AFTER ALL OF THE BLOODSUCKERS TOOK THEIR CUTS, THE FUNDRAISERS, THEY HAD $140,000 LEFT FOR THE CAMPAIGN. THAT IS BETTER THAN BEING A REAL ESTATE BROKER. I WOULD RATHER DO THAT THAN SELL HOUSES. THEY HAD $140,000 LEFT. IT WAS IN THE NEWSPAPER. I THINK I BELIEVE IT. I HAVE SEEN IT. THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN -- THE GUY MADE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS RAISING MONEY FOR ROMNEY. YOU GIVE THEM MONEY AND THEY GET A CUT. OUR LAWS ARE SO CORRUPT. OUR CAMPAIGN-FINANCE  I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO STOP PEOPLE FROM GIVING, BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS A GOOD THING. BUT YOU HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM THE SUPER PAC'S. WHAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE HIS PEOPLE HAVE TO KNOW WHO IT IS, SO YOU HAVE TO OPEN UP THE PROCESS AND LET PEOPLE KNOW -- IF THEY WANT TO GIVE $1 MILLION, THEN THEY CAN, BUT YOU MUST KNOW WHO IT IS. THAT PUTS A LITTLE PRESSURE ON GUYS LIKE BRAD, WHO RAISES HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THE CONCEPT OF THE SUPER PAC, IT IS NO GOOD. IT IS NO GOOD. IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS, TERRIBLE THING. WE WILL CHANGE OUR LAWS BECAUSE YOU REALLY HAVE NO CHOICE. IT IS SO OUT OF CONTROL. IT IS SO TERRIBLE. THE PAPERS THAT ARE IN THIS ROOM TONIGHT SHOULD LOOK AT THIS, THERE IS SO LITTLE MONEY LEFT OVER FOR THE CANDIDATE, THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS I'M SO HAPPY THAT I'M DOING MY OWN. WE ACTUALLY SENT LEGAL LETTERS TO AROUND EIGHT OR NINE SUPER PAC'S. FIRST OF ALL, I'M SURE THAT OUT OF SOME OF THEM, THEY SOLD THE MONEY. SEND I HAVE NO MONEY AND SETS UP A DONALD TRUMP SOMETHING SUPER PAC. HE SETS IT UP. ALL OF A SUDDEN HE HAS TWO MAIN DOLLARS. PEOPLE SEND HIM MONEY. HOW MUCH OF THAT MONEY DO YOU THINK HE IS TO USE TO DO WHAT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING? THAT IS COMMON SENSE. MAYBE ALL OF IT. BUT, I DOUBT IT. SO WE SENT LEGAL NOTICES TO EVERYONE THAT WE COULD FIND HAVING TO DO WITH DONALD TRUMP. WE DO NOT WANT THEIR MONEY. WE SAID, DON'T DO IT. WE DON'T WANT IT. IDEALLY, GIVE THE MONEY BACK TO THE PEOPLE THAT GAVE IT TO YOU. BUT THE SUPER PAC CONCEPT IS CORRECT AND IT IS TERRIBLE AND IT SHOULD BE ENDED. WE WILL GO TO NEW CAMPAIGN-FINANCE LAWS THAT WILL BE TERRIFIC. OK? THANK YOU.   GO AHEAD.  YES, IT IS.   IT IS. IF HE IS FROM TEXAS, TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, THERE IS A LOT OF OIL IN TEXAS. HE GETS A LOT OF MONEY FROM THE OIL COMPANIES AND HE IS TOLD -- TOTALLY AGAINST ETHANOL AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. I AM NOT. I'M TOTALLY IN FAVOR. IT IS A BIG INDUSTRY HERE.   YOU KNOW, IS THAT INDUSTRY IS UPSET, IOWA HAS PROBLEMS. I WAS HERE THROUGH WEEKS AGO WITH A GROUP --  ANY OF THE PEOPLE HERE THAT WERE AT THAT MEETING? THEY WERE SUCH AMAZING PEOPLE, RIGHT? STAND UP. WE HAD A GOOD MEETING, RIGHT? I LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT IT. I WAS IN FAVOR OF IT EVEN BEFORE. THAT IS CORRECT, EITHER MEMBER YOU VERY WELL. HOW COULD YOU FORGET? IT WAS AMAZING. LOOKING AT THE PLANTS. ALSO, BEYOND EVEN THE FUEL CAPACITIES WHICH WE WANT TO CREATE AS MUCH AS WE CAN, TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF JOBS IN IOWA. I SAY TO MYSELF, IF TED CRUZ IS AGAINST ETHANOL, HOW DOES HE WIN IN IOWA? THAT IS VERY ANTI-IOWA. I DON'T KNOW HOW HE WINS IN IOWA.   BUT I TOTALLY FOR IT, OK? THANK YOU.  SOMETIMES PURPOSEFULLY THOUGH.  WOW, THANK YOU. THANK YOU.   COME HERE. BRING HER UP. SO NICE.   WHEN SHE FIRST STARTED THAT QUESTION, I THOUGHT OH NO, HERE IT COMES. AFTER MIDWAY THROUGH, I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. COME ON OVER HERE. GET UNDER THERE. THAT'S GREAT. THAT ASSESSING NICE QUESTION, THANK YOU. COME HERE. DON'T FALL.   THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT IS SO NICE. WHAT IS YOUR NAME?  THANK YOU. BE CAREFUL. I WAS A MEMBER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT SIX MONTHS AGO. I GAVE THE RANGE OF $50,000 TO THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION. I GAVE TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY AWAY. I WAS LIKE THE FAIR-HAIRED BOY. ONCE I SAID I WAS RUNNING, THEY SAID WHAT? YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO RUN. THEN I RAN AGAINST ALL OF THESE SENATORS AND GOVERNORS AND EVERYONE SAID, WELL, I DON'T KNOW. MY WAYS THAT, IF YOU RUN, YOU ARE GOING TO WIN. SHE UNDERSTANDS THE LOVE PEOPLE AND PEOPLE LOVE ME. SHE SAID -- YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY GO AND RUN. YOU HAVE TO ANNOUNCE THAT YOU ARE RUNNING. BECAUSE, NOBODY WILL BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE RUNNING. I DID NOT WANT TO ANNOUNCE BECAUSE I DID NOT WANT TO ANNOUNCE AND THEN HAVE THINGS NOT WORK OUT AND BE LIKE SOME OF THESE GUYS WERE THERE AT ZERO. MANY OF THEM ARE AT ZERO. FINALLY I SAID, WE ARE GOING TO DO IT. THERE WERE TOO MANY THINGS THAT I WATCHED ON TELEVISION WITH OUR PRESIDENT AND THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE. WE GET THIS HORRIBLE, DIRTY, ROTTEN TRADER -- TRAITOR, AND THEY GET FIVE KILLERS THAT THEY HAVE WANTED FOR NINE YEARS. THE WORST KILLERS. THEY ARE ALL BACK ON THE BATTLEFIELD. SOME A DECISION. IRAN DEAL. HOW BAD IS THAT? THEY SELF INSPECT? OK, WE ARE NOT BUILDING. THEY PROMISE THEY'RE NOT BUILDING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THAT'S OK. WE GIVE THEM $150 BILLION AND WE DO NOT EVEN GET OUR PRISONERS BACK? THE WHOLE THING IS CRAZY. I SAW THIS. AND I SAID TO MY WIFE, I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL DO WELL OR NOT. WHO KNOWS? IS A RISKY THING. I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD THAT IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL PERSON YOU CANNOT RUN FOR OFFICE, ESPECIALLY PRESIDENT. I SEE IT ALL THE TIME. THE PEOPLE GO AFTER ME. I DON'T EVEN CARE AT THIS POINT. I SAY, WE HAVE TO DO IT. I LOOKED AT IT THE LAST TIME WITH MITT ROMNEY AND I DID NOT DO IT AND I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE, BECAUSE YOU LET US DOWN. LOOK, HE LET US DOWN. WE HAD A FAILED PRESIDENT. HE WAS A FAILED PRESIDENT. JUST AS BAD AS HE IS NOW. IT IS TRUE.  AND MITT ROMNEY LET US DOWN. THAT LAST MONTH IT WAS LIKE HE WAS NOT EVEN CAMPAIGNING. I SAID, WHY ARE YOU JAY LENO OR DAVID LETTERMAN? WHY ARE YOU NOT DOING A? HE JUST DID NOT DO IT. SO HE LOST THE ELECTION. I BACKED JOHN MCCAIN AND HE LOST. I BACKED MITT ROMNEY AND HE LOST. THIS TIME I SAID, I'M DOING IT MYSELF. WE'RE GOING TO WIN.   BUT, THERE IS AN ESTABLISHMENT OUT THERE. IT IS A REAL ESTABLISHMENT. REAL PEOPLE. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE USED TO HAVING THEIR LITTLE PUPPETS ALL OVER THE PLACE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE USED TO GIVING DONATIONS AND HAVING CONTROL. THEY ARE PEOPLE THAT MAY CALL ME, I WILL TREAT THEM WITH RESPECT, BUT I WILL NOT BE DOING BAD THINGS IF IT IS BAD FOR THE COUNTRY. I WILL NOT LET FORD WILL THEY PLANT IN MEXICO IF I CAN KEEP IT IN MICHIGAN.   I'M NOT GOING TO LET THE CAR COMPANIES AND NABISCO AND ALL OF THESE PEOPLE AND ALL OF THESE COMPANIES -- I AM ALL FOR FREE TRADE AND I THINK IT IS GREAT. I AM FOR IT. IT HAS TO BE SMART TRADE. I WILL NOT LET THEM MOVE TO MEXICO AND SELL THINGS WITHOUT TAX OR ANYTHING. WE LOSE OUR JOBS AND OUR FACTORIES AND THEY GO OVER HERE AND MAKE IT AND WE LET THEM COME THROUGH. HOW DOES THAT HELP US, FOLKS? I WENT TO THE BEST BUSINESS SCHOOL IN THE WORLD, BELIEVE ME, IT DOES NOT HELP US. TRUST ME. WE WILL NOT MAKE IS LIKE THAT ANYMORE. WE CAN'T. WE OWN 19 TRAIN DOLLARS. THE ESTABLISHMENT IS NOT EVER PROBABLY -- IN THE END, IF THIS COUNTRY STARTS HUMMING EVEN THE ESTABLISHMENT, THEY WILL SAY IT IS A GOOD THING. THEY WILL BE BENEFICIARIES ALSO. WE HAVE A REAL ESTABLISHMENT AND THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS HAPPEN BEFORE. A WRITER CALLED UP AND SAID --  ONE OF THE TOP JOURNALISTS TO MY WAY OF THINKING, CERTAINLY IN THE COUNTRY AND BEYOND, AND HE SAID, MR. TRUMP, HOW DOES IT FEEL? AND I SAID HOW DOES WHAT FEEL? HOW DOES IT FEEL, WHAT YOU HAVE DONE HAS NEVER, EVER BEEN DONE BEFORE? I SAID, WHAT HAVE I DONE? HE SAYS YOU HAVE DOMINATED THE SUMMER OF DONALD TRUMP. NOW THEY CALL IT THE AUTUMN OF DONALD TRUMP. HOPEFULLY THEY CALL IT THE SPRING OF DONALD TRUMP. I WANT THE NEXT AUTUMN OF DONALD TRUMP.   I SAID TO THE WRITER, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, I HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING. FRIENDLY, IF I DON'T WIN, I CONSIDER THIS TO BE A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME. I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU. AS MUCH AS I LIKE EATING WITH YOU, I WANT PEOPLE TO DO ANYTHING. HE SAYS, NO YOU HAVE ONE, EVEN IF YOU DON'T WIN. I SAID NO, I DON'T WIN. IF I DO NOT WIN, I HAVE WASTED MY TIME. THE POINT IS, THE ESTABLISHMENT CANNOT BELIEVE IT. THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN A HAPPEN BEFORE. I WAS ON THE COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE FOUR WEEKS AGO OR FIVE WEEKS AGO. TIME MAGAZINE WAS GOING TO PICK THE PERSON OF THE YEAR. EVERYBODY, EVEN MY ENEMIES SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN. I SAID, I WANT WIN. THEY SAID WHY? I SAID I WAS. JUST LIKE I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE EMMY FOR THE APPRENTICE THE FIRST THREE YEARS. I WAS NOMINATED AND I SHOULD HAVE. AND I SAID I WILL NEVER WIN. BECAUSE I'M NOT HOLLYWOOD ESTABLISHMENT. AND WITH TIME MAGAZINE, I SAID, -- O'REILLY IS A GREAT GUY. HE DID AN EDITORIAL AT THE END OF THE SHOW SAYING, NOBODY HAS DONE MORE THAN DONALD TRUMP. HE SHOULD HAVE ONE. I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE, IN ALL FAIRNESS. BUT HE SAID, NOBODY HAS DONE MORE -- TAKEN OVER -- WHAT WE HAVE DONE HAS BEEN AMAZING. IT IS NOT JUST ME, IT IS ALL OF US. FROM DALLAS AND MOBILE AND OKLAHOMA. ALL OF US. BECAUSE THE SPIRIT -- BILL O'REILLY HAD A WHOLE BIG THING. THE OTHER SHOWS, WHERE THEY SAID, DONALD TRUMP, WHAT DO YOU THINK? WELL, ANGELA MERKEL GOT IT. WHAT DID SHE DO? SHE HAS DESTROYED -- SHE IS IN THE PROCESS OF DESTROYING GERMANY. WITH THE MIGRATION. WE HAVE TO HELP THE PEOPLE AT THE MIGRATION. WE HAVE TO CREATE A SAFE ZONE SOMEPLACE IN SYRIA. I DO NOT WANT THEM COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY. I DON'T WANT THEM. WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE.   WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE.   THEN WITH THEIR PRINTING PRESSES THAT NOW DO THE FORGED PASSPORTS. YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT. SO, WE DO NOT KNOW. THE BOTTOM LINE ON THAT IS IT IS SUCH AN INTERESTING QUESTION. YOU WILL KNOW IN ABOUT A MONTH OR TWO WHETHER OR NOT THE ESTABLISHMENT HAS TREATED ME FAIRLY. BUT THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN SAY IS THIS, IF I WIN IOWA, I THINK IT IS OVER. I HAVE SAID BEFORE. BECAUSE, I THINK IF I WIN IOWA, NEW HAMPSHIRE IS AMAZING, PEOPLE ARE AMAZING, YOU WOULD LOVE THE PEOPLE AND THEY WOULD LOVE YOU. YOU HAVE EVERYBODY. THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS IN LOVE. I CALL IT THE NOISY MAJORITY. IT IS NO LONGER A SILENT MAJORITY. IT IS THE NOISY MAJORITY.   BUT, IF WE WIN LIKE I THINK WE ARE GOING TO WIN, BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH A BIG LEAD. HONESTLY, IT IS NOT GOING TO MATTER, THEY CAN DO ANYTHING. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE ESTABLISHMENT. THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING. THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN DO IT IS IF I'M A LITTLE BIT SHORT. IF I'M TO VOTE SHORT I HAVE A PROBLEM. I WILL HAVE TO GO IN THAT CONVENTION AND DEAL WITH ALL OF THESE BLOODSUCKER POLITICIANS AND THEY WILL MAKE THEIR DEALS AND I WILL HAVE ALL OF THE MONEY GUYS AROUND AND THEY WILL BE IN THE BACK ROOM MAKING DEALS. BUT, IF I GET THE NUMBER OF DELEGATES, THERE IS NOT A THING THAT THEY CAN DO. I WILL END UP DOING FINE WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT. AGAIN, I WAS A MEMBER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT SIX MONTHS AGO. THAT WAS A NICE QUESTION AND I APPRECIATED, THANK YOU.   ABSOLUTELY.   THAT WAS AN EASY ONE, I'LL TELL YOU.  SO, COMMON CORE, I'M SUCH A BELIEVER IN EDUCATION. I HAD AN UNCLE WAS A PROFESSOR AT M.I.T.. HE WAS A BRILLIANT GUY. IN FACT, I JUST RETWEETED AN ARTICLE ABOUT HIM TODAY. YOU HAVE TO READ IT. WHEN I SEE SOMEBODY LIKE JEB BUSH -- I WILL TELL YOU ONE THING I RESPECT, HE DID NOT CHANGE HIS VIEWS. HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO GET KILLED ON THIS ISSUE AND I RESPECT THAT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. BUT, IT IS SO WRONG. COMMON CORE IS A TOTAL DISASTER. WE HAVE PEOPLE --    WE HAVE PEOPLE, BUREAUCRATS IN WASHINGTON TELLING YOU HOW YOUR CHILD SHOULD BE EDUCATED IN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE AND ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PLACES THAT WE GO TO. IT IS RIDICULOUS. I GO AROUND AND I SEE THE PRINCIPLES -- I HAVE SEEN SO MANY STUDENTS AND TEACHERS AND PROFESSORS AND PRINCIPLES AND I HAVE SEEN SOME OF THE PEOPLE. EVEN IN IOWA, I HAVE SEEN SOME OF THE LOVE THAT THESE PARENTS GIVE TO THOSE SCHOOLS. THIS IS REAL LOVE. THESE ARE SMART PEOPLE. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT WORKING FOR A PAYCHECK. THESE ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE AND I HAVE SEEN -- MEMBER THIS -- OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS A MESS. WE SPEND MORE MONEY PER PUPIL AS A GOVERNMENT THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND WE ARE IN 20TH PLACE. I MEAN, LIKE DOUBLE WHAT ANYONE ELSE HAS. I WANT TO BRING EDUCATION BACK TO THE LOCAL AREAS. YOU WILL HAVE PARENTS AND YOU WILL HAVE UNBELIEVABLY TALENTED PEOPLE AND THEY LOVE THEIR KIDS AND THEY WANT THEIR KIDS TO BE WELL EDUCATED BECAUSE IT IS SO IMPORTANT. AND YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY WITH IT, OK? THANK YOU.   A TOUGH LOOKING COOKIE. GO AHEAD.  YOU PEOPLE DO IT. I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW YOU REALLY WELL. YOU PEOPLE DO IT. WE ARE BACKING YOU 100%. THE JOB AND THE SPIRIT THAT YOU ALL HAVE, YOU ARE ALWAYS PERFECTLY I TIRED WITH YOUR GREEN, WE ARE BACKING YOU 100%. YOU DO A PHENOMENAL JOB. THERE SHOULD BE MORE PEOPLE LIKE YOU IN THIS COUNTRY. THE WHOLE GRID IS A DISASTER. THE WHOLE COUNTRY. THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR COUNTRY IS FALLING APART. AND NOBODY CAN BUILD LIKE ME. THAT IS WHAT I DO, I BUILD. I AM BUILDING ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, A BIG, TREMENDOUS HOTEL. THAT I GOT FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES. FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. WE HAVE THE BEST PLAN. THE GSA IS TERRIFIC. THEY'RE VERY TALENTED PEOPLE. WE ARE UNDER BUDGET AND AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. THAT IS WHAT WE DO. WHEN YOU SEE THESE THINGS, WHERE THEY ARE BUILDING A BRIDGE AND IT WILL COST A BILLION DOLLARS AND THEN ACROSS $12 BILLION -- HOW ABOUT WHEN THEY BUILT THE HOSPITAL THAT COST $3 BILLION. I LOOK AT IT AND I CAN TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT WILL COST. I SAY, $250 MILLION, NO SIR, $3 BILLION. $3 BILLION? DO YOU THINK SOMEBODY GOT RICH ON THAT WHEN? WE ARE GOING TO STOP ALL OF THIS DEBT. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SO STRONG AND SO WONDERFUL. WE LOVE IT ANYWAY. BUT IT IS SO SAD TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. IT IS SO SAD. AND WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE IT AROUND. ARE WE ALL FINISH WITH THOSE QUESTIONS?  YOUR PLANNER DOESN'T LET UP. SHE IS BRUTAL. COREY, SHE IS BRUTAL. SHE DID A GOOD JOB ON THE APPRENTICE THOUGH.  I'LL TELL YOU, AND THERE IS ANOTHER SPECIAL PERSON WHO DID A GREAT JOB ON THE APPRENTICE GREAT SHAWN JOHNSON. SHE IS ANOTHER CHAMPION. SHE IS ANOTHER ONE. AND SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE YOUNG WOMAN. SHE IS GETTING MARRIED. SHE IS FANTASTIC. WHEREVER SHE MAY BE, SAY HELLO. GO AHEAD.  THAT IS TRUE. WE HAVE SUCH A PROBLEM AND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE RELATES TO EDUCATION. THE HARDEST THING THAT YOU GET IS WHEN YOU GO AROUND AND YOU SEE STUDENTS AND SOMEBODY STUDENTS COME OUT AND HERE'S AND THEY ALWAYS WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE LOANS. STUDENT LOANS. AND THEY ARE GOING THROUGH NICE COLLEGES AND THEIR GOOD STUDENT TO WORK HARD TO COULD BE REALLY TOP IN THEIR CLASS. AND THEY GET ON THE SAY, MR. TRUMP, WE HAVE NO JOBS. WE CAN'T GET JOBS. THEY CAN GET JOBS. WE ARE TO BRING OUR JOBS BACK FROM CHINA. WE'RE GOING TO BRING OUR JOBS BACK FROM ALL OF THESE PLACES OVERSEAS THAT HAS STOLEN OUR JOBS. WE WILL BRING OUR JOBS BACK FROM SOUTH AMERICA AND WILL BRING THEM BACK FROM MEXICO. WE WILL HAVE JOBS AGAIN, BELIEVE ME. WE WILL BE MANUFACTURERS AGAIN. WE WILL START MAKING APPLE COMPUTERS IN THIS COUNTRY. WHAT THE HELL GOOD TO== DOES IT DO TO MAKE THEM IN CHINA? WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR JOBS BACK. LADIES AND THIS HAS BEEN A LOT OF FUN. THIS IS THE FIRST ARRIVED IN THIS KIND OF A THING, AND IT HAS BEEN AMAZING. YES?  THANK YOU. THANK YOU.   I THOUGHT YOU WERE A PROTESTER AT FIRST.   ISN'T THAT A TERRIBLE WAY TO END? A PROTESTER IN YOUR FINAL WORDS. THAT WAS VERY NICE, THANK YOU. WE LOVE THE MILITARY. THANK YOU.   SO, I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE, WE LOVE YOU ALL AND IT IS SO IMPORTANT. IOWA IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME AND THE RELATIONSHIP THAT I DEVELOPED HERE HAVE BEEN AMAZING. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SAFE AGAIN. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU.   WHERE NOT BEEN A TAKE IT NO, WE ANGERED AND TAKE IT WERE NOT A TAKE IT ANYMORE     WE'VE GOT THE RIGHT TO DO IT THERE IS NO WAY WILL LOSE IT THIS IS OUR LIFE,     ","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Rally in Des Moines, Iowa"

MR. TRUMP: WOW! THANK YOU SO MUCH!   THANK YOU. WE START BY PAYING OUR GREAT RESPECTS TO PEARL HARBOR.  WE DON'T WANT THAT STUFF AND   DON'T WANT WORLD TRADE CENTERS. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO US AGAIN. I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO WAIT AN HOUR AND -- WE ALL GOT LUCKY AND WE ARE ALL TOGETHER TONIGHT. A LOT OF BIG NEWS. C NMP N CAME OUT WITH A NEW POLL AND IOWA, GREAT, GREAT STATE, TRUMP, 33%!    YOU HAVE CRUZ AT 20% AND RUBIO AT 11% AND BUSH AT 4%. AND IOWA. WE LOVE IOWA! BY THE WAY, GREAT SHIP NAMED AFTER IOWA. THE OTHER BIG POLL THAT CAME OUT WAS THE NATIONAL POLL, TRUMP 36% AND I WON'T EVEN MENTION THE   OTHER NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY ARE   SO LOW.  WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE   RUNNING, WE HAD 17 AND THEY STARTED TO DROP. BINGE. BINGE. I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. AND YOU WILL BE LOSING A LITTLE. WHEN SOMEONE IS DOWN AT ZERO,  THEY WILL DROP OUT.  BUT YOU WILL BE SEEING IT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE SO  IMPORTANT IN THE SAME POLL WHICH IS THE BIG NATIONAL C NMP N  POLL, ON THE ECONOMY, SO   IMPORTANT, TRUMP, 55%, EVERYONE ELSE, NOTHING.   ON THE BUDGET, THE ECONOMY, BUDGET, I EXPECTED  THIS, ON THE BUDGET, TRUMP, 15 PEOPLE REMAINING. TRUMP, 51%, EVERYONE ELSE -- DISTINCT. HERE'S ONE THAT I STARTED AND I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT. LIKE THE ONE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TODAY BUT I HAVE TAKEN A   LOT OF HEAT, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. NOW, HAD I NOW BROUGHT THAT UP   IN JUNE WHEN I WAS GOING TO ANNOUNCE -- WHICH TAKES COURAGE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.  ALL OF MY LIFE I HAVE HEARD, IF  YOU ARE A SUCCESSFUL PERSON, YOU HAVE DONE A LOT OF DEALS, YOU  CAN'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT. THAT IS THE MINDSET. WE ARE BEING RUN BY PEOPLE WHO   DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE  ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, 48%.  THIS WAS 15 PEOPLE. EVERYONE ELSE, NO GOOD.  AND THING CALLED ISIS. ISIS, DONCHT WORRY, WE WILL TALK A LOT ABOUT ISIS. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?  HERE WE HAVE GERMS WHO HAVE  TALKING. WHO IS MILITARY HERE?  I LOVE YOU.  WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR   MILITARY SO STRONG, SO GREAT,  NOBODY IS GOING TO MESS WITH US  AGAIN. NOBODY!  AND IN MANY WAYS IT'S THE CHEAPEST THING WE CAN DO.  INSTEAD OF FIGHTING THESE WARS   AND WE HAVE LEADERS THAT ARE AFRAID TO DO ANYTHING, THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE US STROW GREAT AND SO STRONG. AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR WOUNDED WARRIORS.  WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.  CLAUPCLAUP  BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT  BEING TAKEN CARE OF OF.  WE HAVE ILLEGAL ALIENS THAT ARE BEING TAKEN CARE OF BETTER THAN  OUR WOUNDED WARRIORS AND THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. ISIS, 46%, WITH ALL OF THESE CHARACTERS RUNNING, ON FOREIGN POLICY.  AND YOU COULD SAY MAYBE IT'S NOT MY THING.  THEY WANT TO SEE STRENGTH AND WANT TO BE PROTECTED. I WATCHED LAST NIGHT AND I   WATCHED THE PRESIDENT TRULY THAT DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING. HE DIDN'T -- HE DIDN'T KNOW WHY HE WAS THERE. HE REFUSES TO USE THE TERM RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. HE REFUSES TO USE THE TERM.  I DON'T KNOW IF HE KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON. I REALLY DON'T!  [CHEERS AND  AND LOOKING AT  HILLARY CLINTON. AND HONESTLY, I KNOW HILLARY, GOING TO BE AN EXTENSION OF OBAMA, MAYBE WORSE.  SHE'S GOT NO STRENGTH, NO STAMINA. YOU DON'T NEED A PRESIDENT WITH  NO STRENGTH OR STAMINA AND BEING RIPPED OFF ON TRADE AND OBAMACARE WHICH IS GOING TO BE REPLACED BY SOMETHING REALLY GOOD!    WHEN OUR SOLDIERS AREN'T BEING TAKEN CARE OF AND OUR MILITARY ISN'T LIKE IT IS TODAY AND ONE OF OUR GENERALS SAYING, WE ARE THE LEAST PREPARED NOW THAN ANY TIME HE HAS EVER SEEN IT AND THAT'S HOW WE ARE.  IN THE MOST DANGEROUS WORLD WE   EVER HAD BECAUSE OF THE POWERFUL WEAPONS. I WATCH THESE GENERALS BEING INTERVIEWED. YOU THINK GENERAL GEORGE PATTON WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED? AFTER BEING INTERVIEWED. THESE GUYS -- AND JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND. BUSH --    BUSH, HE SAID YESTERDAY AFTER BEING INTERVIEWED, HE IS TALKING ABOUT ME AND SAYING THE NICEST THINGS ABOUT ME.  HE SAID 3%, RIGHT? HE SAID, SOME THINGS, I SAID WHO SAYS THAT ABOUT AN OPPONENT? YOU'LL FIND WHAT HE SAID. HE SAID VERY NICE THINGS. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS, WHERE HE IS UPSET WITH ME BECAUSE HE SAYS, THE TONE, THE   TONE OF DONALD TRUMP IS NOT NICE.  AND I SAID ALL THE TIME, WE HAVE PEOPLE WHOSE HEADS ARE BEING CHOPPED OFF IN THE MIDDLE EAST BECAUSE THEY ARE CHRISTIAN AND FOR OTHER REASONS AND BEING DUMPED AND DROWNED IN STEEL CAGES. HILLARY SAID THE SAME THING. MR. TRUMP'S TONE IS NOT NICE. THESE PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN A DIFFERENT PLANET, DIFFERENT PLANET.   AND REMEMBER WHAT I SAID ABOUT HILLARY. WE NEED SOMEBODY'S WHO IS STRONG AND WITH INCREDIBLE ENERGY AND INCREDIBILITY INTELLIGENCE.  I KNOW A LOT OF TOUGH PEOPLE BUT THEY ARE NOT SMART. WE NEED TO YOU.  WE NEED -- WE ARE SO FAR BEHIND THE EIGHT-BALL AND OWE $19 TRILLION THE BUDGET THEY SIGNED  IS GOING TO MAKE IT $ 1 TRILLION. WHO THE HELL EVER HEARD OF A WORD.  THERE WAS NO SUCH WORD. WE OWE $21 TRILLION IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE. WE ARE IN TROUBLE. WE HAVE TO REBUILD OUR COUNTRY   AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND MILITARY AND YET WE DEAL WITH CHINA WHERE THERE IS $00 BILLION IN THEIR  FAVOR. JAPAN, THEY SEND THE CARS BY THE MILLIONS, 70 BILLION A YEAR  IMBALANCE. THAT'S LIKE A LOSS.  LOOK AT MEXICO. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL.  IT WILL BE A REAL WALL.    IT'S GOING TO  THE PEOPLE I'M  DEALING WITH, AND I FOCUS ON   HILLARY. THERE IS 15 OF US. I HAVE MERRY CAME AT ME STRONG AND HE WENT DOWN AND WALKER. EVERY GUY THAT ATTACKED ME, THEY ALL WENT DOWN. WE HAVE TO KEEP IT THAT WAY, RIGHT?   LINDSAY GRAHAM IS AT ZERO.  ZERO.    I DON'T GET LINDSAY GRAHAM.  HE IS LITERALLY AT ZERO. YOU SEE IT.  AND HE KEEPS TALKING.  AND HE IS ON TELEVISION ALL THE  TIME AND HE DOESN'T GO UP. HE IS AT ZEROOVE.  HIS IDEAS ARE SO BAD.  I KNEE HOW TO WIN. AND HE IS ALWAYS LIKE JOHN MCCAIN AND THEY ARE LIKE THE BO BMP BSEY TWINS.  HE IS ALWAYS SITTING WITH JOHN MCCAIN.  YOU HAVE TO KNOW.  ME, I WAS AGAINST THE WAR IN   IRAQ.  YOU HAVE THE RIGHT -- I HAVE A GREAT TEMPERMENT.  YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING HERE TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. I SAID IF YOU ATTACK IRAQ AND WIPE IT OUT. IRAN IS GOING TO TAKE OUT THE EN TIRE THE MIDDLE EAST.  AND THEY SENT A GROUP FROM THE   WHITE HOUSE TO SEE ME BECAUSE I  GOT SO MUCH PUBLICITY, SO MUCH PUBLICITY, THAT THEY SENT A  GROUP FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, SEE MR. TRUMP -- I SAID FELLOWS, YOU ARE GOING HAVE IRAN TAKE OVER  THE MIDDLE EAST AND THAT'S WHAT IS GOING ON. AND IRAN WILL TAKE OVER IT.  IRAQ WITH THE SECOND LARGEST OIL RESERVES ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.  WE LOLS THOUSANDS OF LIVES.  WE HAVE WOUNDED WARRIORS THAT I  LOVE ALL OVER THE PLACE, $2 FRILLION, WE GOT NOTHING.  WE GOT NOTHING.  WE GOT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. AND WE LEFT AND A PRESIDENT WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE.   THANK YOU. ARE  I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SAID, BUT WHATEVER YOU SAID. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SAID, BUT  WHATEVER IT IS. I TREAT HER NICELY.  THANK YOU VERY  TREAT HER NICELY. TO HAVE A SYSTEM NOW, THEY'LL HAVE FOUR PEOPLE WHO INTERRUPTED FOUR TIMES ONE NIGHT AND FOUR PEOPLE, ONE PERSON AT A TIME AND THEY'LL SCREAM SOMETHING AND   THEN THE NEXT DAY THE PRESS WILL SAY, YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT AND TALK ABOUT THREE, FOUR PEOPLE AND   THAT PERSON HAD A VERY WEAK VOICE.   WHAT A WEAK VOICE. STRANGE. STRANGE. TOO BAD. THE FUPPY IS, I LOOK AT DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, AND WOULDN'T IT BE NICE TO GET TOGETHER AND MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN?   I'LL BET YOU IF I SPOKE TO THAT YOUNG WOMAN THAT   QUICKLY -- I THINK I COULD CONVINCE HER WE ARE ALL TOGETHER IN THIS. WE WANT TO HAVE A STRONG COUNTRY. AND WHAT A GOOD GUY THIS IS. YOU HAVE BEEN SO GREAT TO ME AND A PASTOR AND A GREAT GUY. HE HAS BEEN SO GREAT TO ME. I APPRECIATE IT, PASTOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.   IF YOU THINK ABOUT AND THERE WILL BE SO MANY THAT   WON'T BE SATISFIED. AND THEY BELIEVE SOMETHING AND   SOME FRIENDS DON'T AGREE WITH  ME.  IF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT MAKING AMERICA STRONG, WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT AND IF WE'RE NOT  VIGILANT --      THAT WAS THE SAME   PERSON.  I GOT TO TELL YOU SO FAR THE   SECURITY ISN'T DOING A GREAT JOB IN HERE. THAT WAS THE SAME PERSON. WHY DON'T YOU GET HER OUT, BECAUSE HONESTLY, IT IS  INAPPROPRIATE. STRENGTHEN YOURSELF UP. SEE, OUR COUNTRY HAS THIS KIND   OF SECURITY. THAT'S THE PROBLEM WE HAVE. GET HER OUT. PLEASE, THANK YOU. TREAT HER NICELY. ONE PERSON.  THEY LET HER OUT TO GIVE HER A SECOND CHANCE. BUT YOU WOULD THINK THAT EVERYBODY WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME  BASKET THAT EVERYBODY, EVERY   SINGLE PERSON.   I HAVE A LOT OF TIME. DOES EVERYBODY HAVE A LOT OF TIME TONIGHT?    I DON'T WANT THE  PERSON TO BE HURT, BUT SECURITY IS VERY WEAK. ONE PERSON.  ONE PERSON THAT WE HAVE WASTED FIVE MINUTES.  GET THEM OUT.  SO YOU WOULD THINK IF WE COULD   GET TOGETHER WE WOULD BE IN THE SAME BOAT. LAST NIGHT WE WITNESSED  SOMETHING THAT WAS HIGHLY  INAPPROPRIATE. IS THAT ALL THERE IS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH. AND I WROTE SOMETHING THAT IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT AND   PROBABLY NOT POLITICAL CORRECT. I DON'T CARE.    YOU KNOW WE HAD A SITUATION IN   CALIFORNIA, HAVE RECENTLY, WHERE ARE SOMEBODY WAS MAKING BOMBS IN AN APARTMENT, THE MOTHER DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING WRONG. I WATCHED THE SISTER BEING INTERVIEWED. BELIEVE ME IN MY OPINION, SHE WAS LYING. I WATCHED THAT INTERVIEW.  THE BROTHER SAYING, I DIDN'T   KNOW. I DIDN'T KNOW. AND I WATCHED THE NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR AND SAID WE DIDN'T  REPORT THEM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO PROFILE. GIVE ME A BREAK. GIVE ME A BREAK. STUPID COUNTRY. SO MANY DIFFERENT WAIST. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT OUR GREAT   LEADERS WOULD HAVE SAID? THEY DIDN'T WANT TO REPORT THEM  BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS PROFILING. THEY SAW THE PIPE BOMBS. THIS WASN'T TO BUILD A BATHROOM, YOU GOT TO PUT TOO MANY TOGETHER FOR A BATHROOM. BUT OK, YOU ARE OK.  HOW ABOUT WHERE THE FAMILIES AND THE GIRLFRIENDS THEY GO BACK TO  THE WORLD TRADE CENTER. WORST THAN PEARL HARBOR. THEY WERE KILLING INNOCENT CIVILIANS. IT WAS A DIRTY ROTTEN SNEAK ATTACK.  AT LEAST -- THANK GOODNESS HE IS ON MY SIDE. LOOK, WHILE IT WAS AN ATTACK, AT LEAST IT WAS MILITARY. BUT THIS WAS AN ATTACK ON THE WORLD TRADE CENTER. SO, WHAT HAS HAPPENED, WE ARE  OUT OF CONTROL AND NO IDEA WHO IS COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY AND NO IDEA IF THEY LOVE US OR HATE  US OR BOMB US. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON. AND I LOOK AT POLL NUMBERS, THESE NUMBERS I HATED TO LOOK AT AND IT'S VERY, VERY SAD, GO  AFTER SOME OF THE NUMBERS. 25% OF THOSE POLLS, AND THIS WAS FROM THE CENTER OF SECURITY POLICY.  THIS IS PEOPLE LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY. 25% OF THOSE POLLS AGREE VIOLENCE AGAINST AMERICANS IS JUSTIFIED, MUSLIMS. 25%. 51% IS MUSLIMS LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY. I HAVE MUSLIMS WHO ARE GREAT FRIENDS. THEY KNOW WE HAVE A GREAT PROBLEM. BUT SOMETHING IS GOING ON AND WE CAN'T PUT UP WITH IT, FOLKS. 51%, 51%, HIGHLY RESPECTED NUMBER OF POLLING GROUPS WANT TO BE GOVERNED AACCORDING TO SHARI'A. I WROTE THIS UP. MAINSTREAM MEDIA WANTS US TO SURNED THE CONSTITUTION. THEY ARE SO DISHONEST.     AND YET, I GUARANTEE YOU THAT YOUNG WOMAN WHO GOT TAKEN OUT, I GUARANTEE YOU THE   CAMERAS WILL BE ON HER.  DISGUSTING.  WE TALK ABOUT THE MEDIA AND SEE  OF THE MEDIA IS TERRIFIC, BUT MOST OF IT, 70% IS ABSOLUTE  DISHONEST, SCUM. THEY ARE TOTALLY DISHONEST.  I HAVE ONE THE OTHER DAY WHERE I FINISHED THE SPEECH AND SAID   TRUMP WAS INTERRUPTED AND HE   LEFT EARLY.  I SPOKE 45 MINUTES AND I THEN ANSWERED QUESTIONS AND THEN I WEPT AROUND AND -- EVERYBODY   KNEW IT WAS FALSE. AMAZE IDGESLY, THERE IS A MEDIA  GROUP THAT CALLS THE MEDIA AND   WHAT A LIE IT WAS FROM NBC, SHE  IS BACK THERE, LITTLE CATEY. SHE'S BACK THERE.  WHAT A LIE IT WAS    WHAT A LIE IT WAS.  IT WAS A TOTAL LIE.  AND I DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD A   GROUP LIKE THIS WHERE THEY   CRITICIZED THE MEDIA.  AND I LOVED IT.  AND OTHER PEOPLE PICK IT UP. AND THIRD-RANKED REPORTER. REMEMBER THAT. [CHEERS AND  THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA  WANTS TO SURRENDER OUR   CONSTITUTION AND OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. AND I DON'T WANT THAT. I WANT ISIS TO SURRENDER!    VERY SIMPLE.  IT'S VERY SIMPLE. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.  LITTLE BIT OF A CONTROVERSY. THE POLL NUMBERS ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. I LIKE THAT. I -- IS THERE ANY WAY WE COULD   CALL THE ELECTION TOMORROW? I LOVE THAT. THEY ARE NOT COMING AT ME BUT  COMING AT ALL OF US. WE HAVE A NOISY MAJORITY.  PEOPLE ARE FED UP. THEY ARE FED UP WITH   INCOMPETENCE AND STUPID LEADERS AND FED UP WITH STUPID PEOPLE. THEY ARE FED UP WITH STUPID PEOPLE.  WHERE OUR PRESIDENT MAKES A DEAL WITH A DIRTY ROTTEN TRADER. A COLONEL AND A GENERAL WENT TO  SEE HIS GROUP. SIX PEOPLE WERE KILLED. I WATCHED THE PARENTS ON   TELEVISION. I SEEN THE PARENTS.  BUT I WATCHED THE PARENTS ON   TELEVISION. WE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. HE LEFT AND DESSERTED. IN THE OLD DAYS, IT WOULD BE BOOM, GONE.  THAT WOULD BE CALLED DESERTION. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?  HE IS GOING TO HAVE NOTHING. SO HE LEFT. AND TREATED HIM PRETTY LEFT. HE SAID I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS. THIS ISN'T WORKING OUT THE WAY I THOUGHT. ANY WAY, WE GET HIM BACK.  AND HERE'S THE DEAL. WE GET A DIRTY NO-GOOD TRADER,   SIX PEOPLE KILLED. THEY GET FIVE OF THEIR GREATEST  KILLERS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN  AFTER, AFTER, THINK OF IT, FOR   SIX YEARS, IN FACT, I HEAR NINE YEARS. THEY GET -- RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE OUT ON THE BATTLEFIELD TRYING TO KILL EVERY ONE OF YOU FOLKS. THEY GET BERGDAHL AND THEY GET FIVE.  THAT'S THE WAY WE DO IT. THE IRAN DEAL. WE GIVE THEM 150 BILLION. CALLED AMATEUR NIGHT.  WE GAVE THEM $150 BILLION. 24 DAYS, 24 DAYS, WE THINK THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG. 24 DAYS, WE HAVE TO WAIT, BUT MUCH LONGER THAN THAT BECAUSE THERE IS A WHOLE PROCESS BEFORE THE CLK STARS TICKING. BUT THE BEST IS WHERE THEY HAVE  THE RIGHT TO SELF-INSPECT. YOU DOING NUCLEAR WEAPONS? WE ARE NOT DOING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. AND SOMEBODY WOULD SAY THAT IS PROFILING. TRUST ME, THEY ARE GREAT NEGOTIATORS. AND OBAMA IS A HORRIBLE NEGOTIATOR. HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE.   I ALWAYS THOUGHT OBAMA WOULD BE  A UNION FILER. AND YOU KNOW, I DON'T BLAME MCCAIN FOR LOSING. I BACKED ROMNEY AND HE WENT ON   VACATION THE LAST MONTH AND I SAID THIS TIME I'M GOING TO MYSELF.  WE'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE.   AND THE RECENT FOX POLL THAT JUST CAME OUT HAS ME BEATING HILLARY ONE-ON-ONE.  I LOVE THAT. SO IMPORTANT. SO WE PUT OUT A STATEMENT. WE WATCHED THIS A IT IS  IMPOSSIBLE TO WATCH THIS GROSS INCOMPETENCE THAT I WATCHED LAST NIGHT AND WE PUT OUT A   STATEMENT. THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING CRAZY.    SHALL I READ YOU THIS STATEMENT? DONALD J. TRUMP IS CALLING FOR   -- YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS BECAUSE THIS IS PRETTY HEAVY   SENSE. REMEMBER THE POLL NUMBERS, 25%,  51%. REMEMBER THIS. SOLISEN. DONALD J. TRUMP IS CALLING FOR A COMPLETE SHUTDOWN OF MUSLIMS   ENTERING THE UNITED STATES UNTIL OUR COUNTRY'S REPRESENTATIVES CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!    HAVE NO CHOICE. WE HAVE NO CHOICE.   WE HAVE NO CHOICE.  ACCORDING TO PEW RESEARCH, THERE A GREAT HATRED TOWARDS AMERICANS BY LARGE SEGMENTS OF THE MUSLIM  POPULATION. MOST RECENTLY, A POLL FROM   CENTERS FOR SECURE POLICY RELEASED DATA SHOWING THAT 25% OF THOSE POLLED AGREED THAT VIOLENCE AGAINST AMERICANS, THOSE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE   -- BY THE WAY, 1% WILL BE UNACCEPTABLE, 1% IS UNACCEPTABLE, 25% OF THOSE   POLLED AGREE THAT VIOLENCE   AGAINST AMERICANS HERE IN THE  UNITED STATES IS JUSTIFIED.  AS PART -- THINK OF THAT -- AS   PART OF THE GLOBAL JIHAD --  [AUDIENCE  YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR RELIGION? I DON'T THINK SO.  I DON'T THINK SO.  AS PART OF THE GLOBAL JIHAD AND  51% OF THOSE POLLED AGREED THAT  MUSLIMS IN AMERICA SHOULD HAVE THE CHOICE OF BEING GOVERNED ACCORDING TO SHARI'A. 51%. SHARI'A AUTHORIZES -- AND THIS IS -- I MEAN IT'S TERRIBLE -- SHARI'A AUTHORIZES SUCH ATROPICAL STORM TIES AGAINST   NONBELIEVERS WHO WON'T CONVERT,  BEHEADINGS AND MORE UNTHINKABLE ACTS AGAINST AMERICANS   ESPECIALLY WOMEN. ESPECIALLY WOMEN. TOUGH STUFF. AND WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT   WON'T EVEN MENTION THE TERM. AND YOU TALK ABOUT NUMBERS LIKE THIS.  MR. TRUMP WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE VARIOUS POLLING DATA, IT IS  OBVIOUS THAT THE HATRED IS BEYOND COMPREHENSION. WHERE THE HATRED COMES FROM AND  WHY WE'LL HAVE TO DETERMINE -- WE HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT. IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE AND WORSE, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE WORLD TRADE CENTERS. WE CAN BE POLITICALLY CORRECT. UNTIL WE ARE ABLE TOWER DETERMINE AND UNDERSTAND THIS PROBLEM AS A DANGEROUS THREAT IT POSES, OUR COUNTRY CANNOT BE THE VICTIM OF HORRENDOUS ATTACKS BY PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE ONLY IN JIHAD. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN JIHAD. THEY DON'T WANT ON OUR SYSTEM. I HAVE NO, MA'AM SENSE OF REASON FOR RESPECT FOR HUMAN LIFE. WHO HAVE NO RESPECT FOR HUMAN LIFE.    THAT'S ALL RIGHT. SOUNDS LIKE HE IS VERY EXHAUSTED. SO, THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR HUMAN-. SO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.  WE CAN BE WEAK. WE CAN BE INEFFECTIVE AND WE CAN BE FOOLISH. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I'M SURE HE IS A NICE PERSON. BE VERY GENTLE. WHEN I'M TOUGH, THEY SAY HE WAS NASTY. THEY SAY HE WASN'T STRONG AS WE THOUGHT HE WAS. BE VERY NICE. SO BY THE WAY, IF SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THOSE PLACES WHERE   THERE WAS ABSOLUTE SLAUGHTER HAS GUNS YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE CARNAGE THAT YOU HAD IN PARIS!   YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THAT CARNAGE. SO IMPORTANT THE SECOND AMENDMENT, WE HAVE TO PRESERVE IT AND CHERISH. IF THEY HAD GUNS IN PARIS IN   FIVE PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM, PARIS AND FRANCE HAS PROBABLY THE TOUGHEST GUN LAWS AND IT WAS   LIKE TARGET PRACTICE.  COME OVER HERE. BOOM! COME OVER HERE, BOOM! MANY ARE GOING TO BE SITTING OVER H.R. WAITING TO DIE. SAME THING A FEW DAYS AGO IN CALIFORNIA, NO GUNS. WE DIDN'T HAVE GUNS. THE BAD GUYS HAD THE GUNS. AND THESE YOUNG PEOPLE -- AND I TELL THE PRESS, YOU HAVE TO STOP CALLING THEM MASTERMINDS.  THESE ARE DIRTY, ROTTEN SCUM!    REMEMBER THE GUY IN PARIS, I WAS WATCHING THE  NETWORK, BUT SOME OF THEM DISGUSTED ME. THE MASTERMIND IS ON THE LOOSE.  AND YOU WONDER WHY WE LOSE THESE KINDS. THEY ARE YOUNG AND   IMPRESSIONABLE. AND OUR ANCHORS. BUT THEY SAY THE YOUNG   MASTERMIND.  HE IS BRILLIANT. I DON'T EVEN THINK HE HAS A HIGH I. Q. I CALL HIM A DUMMY. BINGE, BINGE, BINGE. SO THE PRICE HAS TO BE   RESPONSIBLE. THEY AREN'T BEING RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE WE ARE LOSING A LOT OF   PEOPLE. WREFF TO SEE BILL GATES AND A  LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT   UNDERSTAND WHAT IS MAPPING.  WE HAVE TO TALK TO THEM CLOSING  UP THAT INTERNET. PEOPLE SAY FREEDOM OF SPEECH,  FREEDOM OF SPEECH. WE HAVE A LOT OF FOOLISH PEOPLE. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE INTERNET BECAUSE THEY ARE  RECRUITING BY THE THOUSANDS. AND WHEN THEY COME BACK, WHERE WERE?  I WAS FIGHTING FOR ISIS. WHEN THEY LEAVE OUR COUNTRY AND GO TO FIGHT FOR ISIS, THEY NEVER COME BACK, THEY NEVER CAN COME   BACK. THEY SHOULD NEVER EVER EVER EVER COME BACK. IT'S OVER. AND THEY ARE TOTALLY RADICALIZED. THE WOMAN, SHE COMES IN ON AN  ENGAGEMENT AND RADICALIZED THE   GUY, THE GUY COULDN'T GET WOMEN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON,  BUT HE BECAME RADICAL IDSED  QUICKLY. HE BECOMES RADICALIZED AND GO ON A SPREE. FOLKS, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.  THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. WE HAVE TO BE TOUGH AND WE HAVE  TO BE SMART AND HAVE TO BE VIGILANT AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT  MOSQUES AND RESPECT MOSQUES. WE HAVE NO CHOICE. WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE SOMETHING IS HAPPENING.  MAN THERE IS ANGER. AND WE HAVE TO GO ABOUT IT.  AND THESE PEOPLE ARE SITTING BACK. WE CAN'T BEAT PEOPLE.  AND DIDN'T WANT TO TELL ANYBODY. WE CAN'T BE THAT.  WHEN WE SEAL VIOLATIONS, YOU   HAVE TO REPORT THOSE VIOLATIONS AND QUICKLY. DON'T WORE ABOUT PROFILING. I WILL DEFEND YOU FROM PROFILING !   SO WHEN I SAW I STARTED THIS WHOLE QUEST. IT'S BEEN AN AMAZE MAZEING. AND 20,000 PEOPLE IN DALLAS. I MEAN, MOBILE, ALABAMA, 35,000 PEOPLE.  HERE, EVERY TIME I COME TO SOUTH CAROLINA, EVERY TIME I GO TO IOWA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, VIRGINIA, FLORIDA, WE HAVE CROWDS THAT ARE NUTS. THE THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TRYING TO GET IN.  I TALKED TO THEM FOR A WHILE. BUT THERE IS AN UNBELIEVABLE LOVE IN THIS ROOM.  THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO. UNBELIEVABLE LOVE IN ALL OF THESE PLACES. OKLAHOMA, 20,000 PEOPLE STANDING IN A PARK ON QUICK NOTICE. THERE IS AN UNBELIEVABLE LOVE AND UNBELIEVABLE LOVE OF THE COUNTRY. WE DON'T WANT TO BE BAD PEOPLE AND DON'T WANT TO BE TOUGH AND NASTY AND WE BELIEVE IN THE CONSTITUTION BUT WE CAN'T LET PEOPLE KILL US. THEY WANT TO KILL US AND WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN. AND I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS IS L A VERY, VERY SUCCESSFUL MAN AND  HE CAME TO AN EPT WITH MONTH   WITH 24,000 PEOPLE. HE IS A GREAT FINANCIAL GUY. BELIEVE ME, YOU ARE GOING TO BE  IN GOOD SHAPE. YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE THING WITH   ALL OF THESE ZPICE. EVERYONE ELSE IS -- I'M SELF-  FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN. AND THESE GUYS ARE GETTING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I CAN'T TAKE IT. I DON'T WANT TO DO IT. MY HOLE LIFE I COULDN'T DO IT. BUT CAME IN AND I SAID, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? I DON'T WANT YOUR  THEY ARE LIKE GAMBLERS.  LET ME TELL YOU, I GAVE  MILLIONS.  DON'T FORGET, I WAS THE FARE-HAIRED BOY. I WAS THE ESTABLISHMENT AND GAVE CHECKS. I USED TO SAY SENATORS, DON'T CALL ME. WE'LL SEND YOU A CAMPAIGN  CONTRIBUTION. IN THE END, THE PEOPLE THAT  GIVES THE MILLIONS DOLLARS TO THE CORRUPT PACS, THEY CONTROL PUSH -- BUSH AND RUBIO.  HE HAS TO HIT ME FIRST.  I PROMISE YOU -- I PROMISE YOU.  I HAVE BEEN NICE TO CHRISTIE.  CHRIS CHRISTIE, HE IS A FRIEND OF MINE AND NOT DOING WELL IN  THE POLLS. HE HATED THIS AND YET HE SAID, YOU GOT TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE   STATEMENTS IN THE PAST.  BUT HE HIT ME THAT WE HAVE TO  STOP THE MUSLIMS UNTIL WE KNOW   WHAT'S GOING ON. AND HE TALKED ABOUT THAT.  THAT IS AN EXPERIENCE. BUT THAT'S THE STATEMENT OF AN   INEXPERIENCED MAN. A STATEMENT THAT WE HAVE TO STOP PEOPLE FROM COMING IN. SO CHRIS, WHO IS FRIEND OF MINE, HE HIT ME HARD.  SO I WON'T DO THIS.  SO LOOK, HERE'S THE STORY,   GEORGE WASHINGTON BREACH.  HE KNEW ABOUT IT. HOW DO YOU HAVE BREAKFAST? THE BIGGEST IN THE UNITED STATES.  PEOPLE COULDN'T GET IN.  AMBULANCES, FIRE TRUCKS, THEY  WERE ALL THE TIME. THEY NEVER SAID, HEY, BOSS, WE ARE CLOSING UP THE GEORGE  WASHINGTON BRIDGE AND THEY   NORTHWESTERLY TALKED ABOUT THE   WEATHER. HE KNEW ABOUT IT.  HOW DID HE KNOW ABOUT IT. AND LOOK, IT CALLED LIFE.  I WOULD TAY THERE IS LESS THAN 1% CHANCE. HE KNEW ABOUT IT. THEY DIDN'T MENTION ABOUT IT.  THEY JUST SAY, CHRIS, WE ARE CLOSING UP THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE BECAUSE A CERTAIN AREA IS AGAINST YOU. NINE DOWNGRADES. NINE DOWNGRADES. I HAVE PROHIBIT OVER THERE. I'LL USE AN EXPRESSION COMING OUT OF MY EARS, OK.  TREMENDOUS TAXES OVER THERE. NINE DOWNGRADES. YOU HAD CHRISTIE, SO FRIENDLY WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA.  I CALLED AND SAID, IS HE GOING   TO VOTE FOR OBAMA? I THINK HE POSSIBLY DID. AND ROMNEY.  ONE OF THE REASONS I WAS DISAPPOINTED.  HE HAD DINNER. IF CRIFERTEY DID THAT TO ME I WOULD HAVE NEVER TAUN TO HIM   AGAIN. I FILED PAPERS AND PEOPLE ARE SAYING WOW!  YOU KNOW, I BUILT A GREAT, GREAT COMPANY. TREMENDOUS CATCH, TREMENDOUS ASSETS, TREMENDOUS NETWORK, UNBELIEVABLE CASH FLOW. EVERYBODY SAID, HE WON'T RUN. I TOOK A DEEP BREATH AND WE CAME DOWN THE FAMOUSES CALL ATOR. WE WOULD HAVE TURNED OUR COUNTRY AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A   POSITIVE NOTE. THEN THEY SAID, HE ANNOUNCED AND ALL THESE TALKING HEADS WHO  AREN'T SMART PEOPLE AND THEY SAID THEY WEPT TO AN IVY-LEAGUE COLLEGES.  ONE IS BRILLIANT BECAUSE HE  WEARS GLASSES. WHAT HAPPENS, WHAT HAPPENS, IS THEY SAY, I NEVER FILED FOR HIM. YOU SIGN YOUR LIFE AWAY. THEY SAID WELL, HE WILL NEVER SIGN HIS FINAL STATEMENT. AND WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW.  AND IF HE DOES, YOU ARE ENTITLED TO DELAYS AND DELAYS. AND THEY WILL LAST TO THE LAST   OF THE ELECTION. I FILED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. AND WHAT HAPPENS?  THEY WENT DOWN AND COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.  IT WAS MUCH, MUCH BETTER. I BUILT A GREAT COMPANY. IT IS WORTH BILLIONS AND   BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. DORAL, TRUMP TOWER.  SO MANY GREAT THINGS. LAND THE POE TAMACK AND UNTIL  NORTH COORM GREAT PIECE OF PROPERTY. BEST LOCATION. AND PERHAPS? I FILED. AND THEY CAN'T BELIEVE IT. THEN THEY SAID, MAYBE HE WON'T DO SO WELL WITH THE POLLS. AND PEOPLE NEVER THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO RUN.  THE REASON IS, LOOK,  THE REASON I TELL YOU CERTAIN  THINGS AND THE REASON WHY I HAVE DONE AND CITY COULDN'T GET IT  BUILT FOR EIGHT YEARS. AND THEY COULDN'T GET IT DONE. I WENT TO THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK, ED KOCH, HE DIDN'T LIKE IT.  I SAID THAT'S OK.  IF IT COSTS MORE THAN $2 MILLION. I GOT IT DONE IN FOUR MONTHS AND ICE SKATING IN SENT FROOL PARK   AND I STILL RUN IT.   TRALM  I DID A BIGGER VERSION. THINGS HAVE BEEN UNDER   CONSTRUCTION. THEY COULDN'T GET IT DONE AND OPERATING. THAT'S WHAT I DO. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED IN OUR   COUNTRY AND BUILDING ON PENNSYLVANIA.  ONE OF THE GREATEST HOTELS. IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. EVERYBODY WANTED IT. ONE OF THE MOST SOUGHT-AFTER   PROJECTS AND I GOT IT. CAN YOU IMAGINE ME GETTING IT IN THE BOW ALLA ADMINISTRATION. THEY WANTED STRONG FINANCIALS. WE CAME UP WITH THIS INCREDIBLE PLAN.  THE PLAN IS UNDER PLAN A GOING   TO OPEN UP IN 2017 AND GOING TO OPEN UP IN SEPTEMBER 2016, RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION ON   PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE.   THIS IS THE KIND OF MIND-SET, ONE OF THE GREAT BUSINESSMEN. PFIZER IS LEADING THE UNITED   STATES. IN THE OLD DAYS WOULD LEAVE TO SOUTH CAROLINA, FLORIDA OR   SOMEPLACE WHERE THE TAXES ARE  LOWER. TODAY THEY LEAVE THIS COUNTRY FOR OTHER COUNTRIES. WE ARE LOSING PFIZER AND LOSING  OUR GREAT COMPANIES. $2.5 TRILLION OFFSHON AND  EVERYBODY AGREES IT SHOULD COME HOME.  FOR THREE YEARS THEY CAN'T MAKE A DEAL.  THERE IS NO LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON.  WE WILL MAKE THIS COUNTRY SO GREAT. WE HAVE PEOPLE -- AND I'LL TELL  YOU SOMETHING -- I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING. SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING TO ME  THE OTHER DAY AND WHAT I REALLY WANT TO DO --  [CROWD  I WANT TO BE THE PEOPLE'S PRESIDENT. THINK OF THIS. I DON'T WORK FOR ANY OF THE  LOBBYISTS OR ANY OF THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE LEADING OUR COUNTRY IN  THE WRONG  THE BEST THING I'VE SEEN GOING AROUND, AND THE THING OF SEEN ANYTHING ELSE, IS HOW SMART THE PEOPLE ARE. THERE DON'T BELIEVE THOSE PEOPLE IN THE BACK. COLONEL BELIEVE THEM.-- THEY DON'T BELIEVE THEM. THE PEOPLE ARE REALLY SMART. WHAT HAS GIVEN ME INSPIRATION ARE THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE IT GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE, AND I LOVE YOU ALL, AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SOUTH CAROLINA.   WE LOVE YOU, THANK YOU.   THANK YOU VERY MUCH.        WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT    WHOA    WE;RE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT ","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Rally in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina"

MR. TRUMP SAYS HE IS UNSURE IF JERUSALEM SHOULD BE NAMED THE  CAPITAL OF ISRAEL.  HE ALSO SAYS -- DISCUSSES PLANS  TO FIGHT TERRORISM AND NEGOTIATE  A BETTER NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN.  THIS IS ABOUT 35 MINUTES.  MR. TRUMP: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU JUST LIKELY BECAUSE MY  DAUGHTER HAPPENS TO BE JEWISH.  SHE HAS A GREAT HUSBAND, JARED. IVANKA CANNOT BE HAPPIER. THE ONLY BAD NEWS IS I CAN'T GET HER ON SATURDAY NIGHT FOR A CALL. I CAN'T SPEAK TO MY DAUGHTER ANYWHERE ON SATURDAY BUT THAT'S OK.  IS AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU. I HAVE DEVOTED SO MUCH TIME OVER  MY LIFE TO ISRAEL. THE OTHER POLITICIANS CAN TALK,  AND BELIEVE ME THEY HAVE NOT  KNOWN THAT I'VE DONE. I RECEIVED MANY AWARDS. I WAS THE GRAND MARSHALL OF THE  ISRAELI DAY PARADE AT A VERY  DANGEROUS TIME OF PEOPLE SAID  DON'T DO IT. I WALKED UP FIFTH AVENUE. I WAS LOOKING FOR LOTS OF  TROUBLE BUT I SAID NO WAY I'M  NOT GOING TO DO IT.  IT WAS A ROUGH TIME. IT WAS 2004 AND IT WAS A  TREMENDOUS WAS SUCCESSFUL --  MAYBE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PARADE  EVER HAD.  SO I MET A DIFFERENT POSITION  THAN THE OTHER CANDIDATES BECAUSE OF THE ONE CANDIDATE THAT I DON'T WANT ANY OF YOUR  MONEY. I WANT YOUR SUPPORT AND NOT YOUR  MONEY. I AM SELF FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN. IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I VERY LITTLE MONEY INVESTED SO FAR. I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS TIME I  WOULD HAVE ABOUT $30 MILLION IN  ADS AND I HAVE NONE. I TOOK A SMALL REGULAR COMMERCIAL THE OTHER DAY IN IOWA  BUT WE HAVE VIRTUALLY NO MONEY  INVESTED IN ADS OR ADVERTISING. I THINK HE WAS BUSINESS PEOPLE  WILL FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THIS  AND RESPECT IT. AT FIRST I WAS EMBARRASSED. I SAID I THINK WE WILL HAVE TO  SPEND MONEY TO SPEND MONEY BUT  IT'S NOT REALLY LIKE A GOOD  THING TO DO BECAUSE I AM IN FIRST PLACE BY A LOT.  IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE. EVERY SINGLE POLL IN EVERY  SINGLE STATE. THE NUMBERS JUST CAME IN THREE  MINUTES AGO IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. TRUMP HAD 27. THE NEXT ONE IS 13, 10, 9, 8, 5 AND THE REST ARE OFF THE BOARD. THEY WILL HAVE TO DROP OUT SOON. FAVORABILITY -- ISIL AT THE TOP  OF HER MOST BUT FAVORABILITY IS  NOW WITH 50-39 NIV HILLARY EASILY 46-41. THAT IS ULTIMATELY THE MOST  IMPORTANT.  AND I HAVE BEEN A TREMENDOUS FAN  AND A COMMITTEES CONTRIBUTOR. I'VE GIVEN A LOT OF MANY RECENTLY TO HAZALA $100,000 EMERGENCY RESPONSE. THEY DO A FANTASTIC JOB. MY FATHER WAS A WAS A BIG  SUPPORTER.  I GREW UP IN THAT ENVIRONMENT. I GREW UP IN BROOKLYN QUEENS AND  ISRAEL WAS ALWAYS VERY PAIR OF -- THEIR AMOUNT THAT OUR MINDS. I BEEN CRITICIZED FOR RECEIVING SUMMIT HE AWARDS FROM JEWISH  GROUPS. THEY LOOK AT MY WALL.  IT IS LOADED UP. ANOTHER CHRISTIANS ARE CATCHING  UP. -- BUT NOW THE CHRISTIANS ARE  CATCHING UP.  THEY ARE CATCHING UP NOW AND  THEY ARE GREAT. OBAMA IS THE WORST THING THAT IS  EVER HAPPENED ISRAEL.  THE WORST. AND WHEN I SEE GREAT FRIENDS OF  MINE WHO ARE VERY PRO-ISRAEL,  VERY -- THEY LOVE ISRAEL.  THEY LOVE IT WITH PASSION. AND HAVING FUNDRAISER FOR OBAMA. I SAY WHAT YOU DOING?  THEY SAY WE DON'T KNOW. HE COMES TO THE WORK AND WE  DON'T KNOW. I SAY HE IS A DISASTER.  I BELIEVE THE IRAN DEAL -- WE  ARE NEGOTIATORS. WE DON'T BUILD GAS STATIONS IN  THE MIDDLE OF AFGHANISTAN FOR $43 MILLION. $43 MILLION IN THE THE USE THE  WRONG KIND OF TERMINAL BECAUSE  THEY DON'T SELL THAT TYPE OF  GAS. $43 MILLION FOR A GAS STATION. HOW MANY THINK THEY COULD'VE DONE IT FOR LESS? COULD YOU RAISE YOUR HANDS PLEASE. I LOOK AT OBAMA AND THE DEAL WE  GIVE TO IRAN. $150 BILLION. THEY DON'T NEED TO DEVELOP  NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THEY CAN BUY  THEM. IT'S TRUE. WHY DID THEY HAVE TO DEVELOP  THEM. WE GIVE THEM $150 BILLION. THEY GO OUT AND IN TERMS OF SURVEILLANCE, THEY HAVE THE  RIGHT TO SELF INSPECT. HOW ABOUT THAT? THEY CAN SELF INSPECT.  WE WILL LET THEM SELF INSPECT  AND THAT YOU HAVE THE 24 DAYS.  THE 24 DAYS, WE ARE ALL GIVEN  CONTEXT ON START UNTIL SUCH AND  SUCH HAPPENS. IT COULD BE FOREVER BEFORE YOU  GET TO GO IN AND INSPECT. WE DON'T EVEN GET OUR PRISONERS  BACK. AND THEY WANT TO START A  NEGOTIATION TO GET THE PRISONERS  BACK AND THEY WANT 19 PEOPLE FOR OUR 3. WE HAVE 4, BUT THEY ONLY WANT TO  TALK ABOUT THREE. THAT SHOULD OF A NEGOTIATED RENT THE BEGINNING THREE YEARS AGO.  AND MAYBE BETTER THAN ANY -- PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM UNDERSTAND. YOU WALK IN AND, BY THE WAY, DID  YOU EVER SEE A NEGOTIATION TAKES  A LONG? WE CONCEDED ON EVERY SINGLE -- WE DID NOT WIN ANYTHING. THAT SHOULD OF BEEN WITH OUR  PRISONERS DAY ONE, WHATEVER IT  WAS, YEARS AGO. WE HAVE TO GET OUR PRISONERS BACK.  WE NEED THEM.  IT WILL MAKE US LOOK BETTER. EVERYBODY IS GOING TO LIKE US  MORE WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. ANY DEAL WE STRIKE IS GOING TO  LOOK GOOD. WE HAVE TO GET OUR PRISONERS  BACK. DAY ONE. THEY SAY WILL NOT GIVE THEM AND  WE WILL SAY BYE-BYE. CALL US WHEN YOU'RE READY. THEN WE GO OUT AND DOUBLE UP IN  TROUBLE OF SANCTIONS. I GUARANTEE YOU WITHIN 40 HOURS THEY ARE CALLING, BEGGING US TO COME BACK TO THE TABLE AND YOU  HAVE YOUR PRISONERS BACK.  IT IS SO EASY. THE PRESIDENT AND JOHN KERRY, IT  WAS PROBABLY THE WORST NEGOTIATOR I'VE EVER SEEN, HE  DID NOT READ THE ARTICLE -- ""THE  ART OF THE DEAL.""  HE IS ONE OF THE FEW. HE DID NOT READ IT. AND OBAMA DEFINITELY DO NOT READ IT. OBAMA.  BUT THEY SAID, THIS IS HARD TO  BELIEVE BUT THIS IS WHAT THEY SAID, I HAVE TO SAY EVERYTHING  ETC. COLLECT -- EXACTLY CORRECT. THEY SAID WE DID NOT DO, GET NEGOTIATIONS BY S&P PRISONERS. IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED. WE WANT OUR PRISONERS BACK.  SO COMPLICATED. SO NOW WE WILL END UP MAKING A  NEW DEAL PROBABLY AT SOME POINT.  I WILL TELL YOU THIS.  IF I WIN, BEFORE I TAKE OFFICE I  GUARANTEE THOSE PRISONERS ARE  GOING TO BE BACK.  THEY WILL BE BACK. I GUARANTEE IT. THEY WILL BE BACK. NOW, OUR PRESIDENT DOES NOT WANT  TO USE THE TERM. WE HAD ANOTHER EVENT WHICH PROBABLY WAS RELATED. IT ALWAYS HAPPENS. BUT PROBABLY WAS. I THINKING -- IT PROBABLY WAS RELATED. RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT REFUSES TO USE THE TERM. HE REFUSES TO SAY IT. THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON WITH HIM THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT.  AS FAR AS HILLARY IS CONCERNED, SHE HAS GOT TO GO WITH WHAT HE  WANTS. SHE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO  RUN. . WHAT SHE DID IS CRIMINAL WITH  THE E-MAILS  SHE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO  RUN. SHE IS GOING TO HAVE TO FOLLOW HIS LINE BECAUSE SHE IS ON A  THREAD. IN REAL LIFE IS ATTORNEY GENERAL -- HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL IS GOING  TO LISTEN TO HIM. I THINK IT'S VERY DISHONEST WHAT  IS GOING ON WITH OUR GOVERNMENT. GENERAL PETRAEUS WAS GIVEN A LIFE-CHANGING SENTENCE. OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SENT TO  JAIL. HE WAS -- I DON'T WANT TO GET  INTO IT WITH THE POOR GUY.  HE WENT FOR NOTHING COMPARED TO  WHAT SHE DID.  FOR NOTHING. FOR 5% OF WHAT SHE DID. AND OBAMA -- SHE CANNOT GO AGAINST HIM OR SHE GETS  INDICTED.  THAT IS THE END OF IT.  WHEN YOU SEE HILLARY BACKING OF  VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING HE SAYS,  AND HE IS GOT CONTROL OF HER.  IT'S TOTAL CONTROL. SHE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO  RUN. WHAT YOU GIVE IS A CRIMINAL ACT. THIS IS A SIX-YEAR STATUTE OF  LIMITATIONS. SHE IS FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE. IF SHE DOES NOT BECOME  PRESIDENT, SHE CAN BECOME A --  THIS IS MAKE SENSE TO ANYBODY? WHAT SHE DID WAS JUST WRONG. SHE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN CORRUPTION HER WHOLE LIFE.  WHETHER IT IS WHITEWATER -- HER  WHOLE LIFE IS CORRUPTION.  SHE WAS A HORRIBLE SECRETARY OF STATE. SHE DID A HORRIBLE JOB OTHER  THAN TRAVEL A LOT. NOTHING EVER GOT DONE. THE WORLD BLEW UP AROUND HER. IT BLEW UP. 500-600 CALLS AND E-MAILS FROM  OUR AMBASSADOR ASKING FOR HELP  AND SHE DID NOT RESPOND. THE TRUTH IS SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH OR THE ENERGY. SHE RESPONDED TO HER FRIENDS. SOME OF THOSE FRIENDS ARE QUITE INTERESTING. AN INTERESTING FRIEND GOING ON  THERE. SHE RESPONDED -- YOU GET THAT,  RIGHT?  A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T GET THAT. SHE RESPONDED TO HER FRIEND BUT  SHE DOES NOT RESPOND TO AN  AMBASSADOR THAT IS ASKING FOR  HELP. HUNDREDS OF REQUESTS AND SHE  DOESN'T RESPOND. MEMBER THIS -- FOR MEMBER THIS. -- REMEMBER THIS. THE OTHER DAY I WAS IN FLORIDA  AND WE HAD 12,000 PEOPLE IN  SARASOTA. 12:00 IN THE AFTERNOON WITH A  FOOTBALL GAMES GOING ON.  12,000 PEOPLE. EXHIBIT CONSIDER HEALTH 5000 -- THE CONVENTION CENTER HELD 5000. I ASKED IF I COULD GET A LARGER SPACE? WE SET A BIG RECORD. WE SET A RECORD EVERYWHERE. WE BEAT THE RECORD OF ELTON JOHN.  ELTON JOHN. I'M NO LONGER COMPETING THE  POLITICIANS. I'M COMPETING WITH MUSICAL  TALENT. ONE OF THE GREAT MUSICIANS SAYS  YOU GET THE LARGEST CROWDS OF  ANY SINGLE HUMAN BEING ON EARTH WITHOUT A GUITAR. MEANING WHO DISLIKE COUNT ON  MUSIC. -- WHO DOES NOT COUNT ON MUSIC. WE HAD AM IN -- AN INCREDIBLE  RESPONSE. BASED ON THE RESPONSE AND THE POLLS, I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY. STUPIDLY DOING TO GET MONEY. TRUMP DOES NOT WANT MONEY. EVEN THOUGH HE IS BETTER THAN  ALL THESE GUYS AND HE IS GOING  TO DO MORE FOR ISRAEL THAN  ANYBODY ELSE. EATING -- EVEN THOUGH BIBI NETANYAHU WANTED ME TO DO  COMMERCIAL FOR HIM AND I DID  ANYONE HIS RACE -- ADN HE -- AN DHE WO -- AND HE WON HIS  RACE. MY WHOLE LIFE I'VE BEEN A BUSINESSMAN AND A DEVELOPER. I HAVE EMPLOYED TENS OF  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OVER MY  LIFETIME. I HAVE UNBELIEVABLE STATEMENTS AND UNBELIEVABLE -- A LOT OF  PEOPLE SAID HE WILL NEVER RUN  BECAUSE HE WILL NEVER WANT TO  FILE VARIOUS PAPERS AND HE WILL KNOW -- HE WILL NEVER FILE THIS. WE KNOW ABOUT PAPERS. HE SIGNED A LIFE AWAY. THEY SAID HE WILL NEVER SIGN OR  FILE HIS FINANCIALS BECAUSE  MAYBE HE IS NOT AS RICH AS  PEOPLE THINK. I FINANCIALS, -- MY FINANCIALS,  100 PAGES LONG. PEOPLE REALIZE HE'S MUCH BIGGER  AND MUCH STRONGER. LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS. WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW IS IF I DID NOT RUN I PROBABLY WOULD'VE  FILED ANYWAY BECAUSE IT BUILD A  GREAT COMPANY AND I LIKE TO BRAG  ABOUT IT WHENEVER POSSIBLE. IT IS TRUE. SOME OF THE GREATEST ASSETS, DURAL AND TRUMP TOWER AND MANY BUILDINGS IN MANHATTAN. BANK OF AMERICA BUILDING IN SAN  FRANCISCO. SO MANY OTHER BUILDINGS. THE REASON I BRING THAT UP IS  BECAUSE THAT IS THE KIND OF  THINKING WE NEED. I DON'T BRING IT UP AS REGULAR  AS YOU. -- BRAGODICIA. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT DON'T OF THE FIRST THINK ABOUT THE WORD  NEGOTIATION. I THINK ANYBODY IN THIS OFFICE, BELIEVE ME, AND THEY ARE BETTER  THAN OBAMA AND BETTER THAN KERRY  AND BETTER FROM THE FULLEST PEOPLE -- FOOLISH PEOPLE. IT'S SO EMBARRASSING WHEN YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS. SERGEANT BARNARD -- WE GET A  TRAITOR IN THEY GET FIVE OF THE  GREATEST KILLERS THEY WANTED FOR  YEARS. AND THEY KNEW HE WAS A TRAITOR BEFORE YOU MAKE THE DEAL.  YOU KNOW ABOUT SERGEANT  BERGDAHL. HE DESERTED AND SIX PEOPLE WERE  KILLED TRY TO GET HIM BACK. THEY WERE LOOKING FOR HIM. A GENERAL AND A KERNEL TO SEE  THIS PEOPLE AND THEY SAID NO, HE  DESERTED. AND WE STILL NEED TO DEAL. WE GET A TRAITOR. HE WANT TO RENEGOTIATE DEALS? I WOULD SAY ABOUT 99.9 -- IS HER  ANY WAY THAT DOES NOT  RENEGOTIATE DEALS IN THIS ROOM?  PERHAPS MORE THAN ANY ROOM I'VE  EVER SPOKEN IN.   IT'S OK. I'VE BEEN CALLED THAT A COUPLE TIMES. I WENT TO RENEGOTIATE THE DEAL. I WANT TO DROP HIM RIGHT BACK IN  THE SMACK WHERE HE CAME FROM. YOU KNOW OF THOSE FIVE ARE NOW? THEY ARE ALL ON THE BATTLEFIELD  FIGHTING US IN TRYING TO KILL US  AND KILLING ANYBODY THEY CAN SEE  THEM. SO THEY CAN GET THEIR FIVE GUYS THEY WANTED FOR NINE YEARS. AND WE GET A DIRTY, ROTTEN  TRADER. THAT'S THE WAY OUR PEOPLE NEGOTIATE.  THEY ARE STUPID PEOPLE.  IT'S VERY SAD. IT'S VERY SAD. I'LL JUST TELL YOU THAT I'M GOING TO WIN. I AM. UNLESS SOMETHING HAPPENS. YOU WALK ACROSS THE STREET IN  THE WRONG THING HAPPENS BUT I  HAVE A GREAT SECRET SERVICE. IT'S NICE WHEN YOU ARE NUMBER  ONE, THE GIVE YOU SECRET  SERVICE.  TALENTED PEOPLE, GREAT PEOPLE. I BELIEVE I'M GOING TO WIN. I HAVE A GREAT FEELING ABOUT IT. MY LIFE IS BEEN ABOUT WINNING. MY LIFE IS BEEN ABOUT WINNING  AND THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO DO  FOR THE COUNTRY.  AND PEOPLE SAY ABOUT MY COMPANY AND DEALS.  I HAVE NO INTEREST. THE OTHER DAY IVANKA, DAD,  WEAKENED BY THIS WONDERFUL  OFFICE BUILDING. I SAID HONEY, WHO CARES? HOW CAN YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT SUCH TRIVIAL THINGS?  IT'S AMAZING. NOW I'M DEALING IN TRILLIONS. WE OF $19 TRILLION -- OWE $19  TRILLION. WE DESIGNED A BUDGET DEAL THAT IS SO BAD. THESE REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS GO TO WASHINGTON AND THEY WILL END OBAMACARE, WHICH I AM DOING. IT WILL BE REPEALED AND REPLACED WITH SOMETHING MUCH BETTER. THEY GO TO WASHINGTON AND THEY  ARE GOING TO DO THIS AND  BUDGETS. THE GUY BEFORE SAID WE'RE GOING  TO WORK ON THE BUDGET.  IT'S ALL ABOUT THAT. WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY WILL DO BUDGETS AND WE ARE GOING TO DO  THIS AND THAT. I TELL THE STORY. THEN THEY WALK INTO THE CAPITAL  BUILDING WHICH IS MAGNIFICENT  AND THEY LOOK UP. DARLING, LOOK AT THOSE COLUMNS. LOOK AT THE CEILING. WITH THE ANGELS. LOOK AT THESE MAGNIFICENT FLOORS.  WE HAVE ARRIVED. THIS IS INCREDIBLE. AND THEN THEY BECOME MAINSTREAM. THEY VOTE ON OBAMACARE.  THEY DON'T BELIEVE. THEY LOSE ALL THEIR COURAGE.  I WANT THESE A NICE WORD AROUND  WORDS I GET REPORTED FOR FOUL  LANGUAGE.  THEY LOSE ALL OF THEIR COURAGE AND THEY HAVE LET US DOWN. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN WITH ME. AGAIN, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO  SUPPORT ME EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW  I'M THE BEST THING THAT COULD  EVER HAPPEN TO ISRAEL. I WILL BE THAT.  I KNOW WHAT YOU WILL NOT SUPPORT  ME. I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY. ISN'T IT CRAZY?  IT'S TRUE. I WANTED YOUR MONEY AND I THINK  WOULD HAVE A DAM GOODN -- DAMN GOOD CHANCE. GEISLER TO GIVE ME MILLIONS. THIS POOR JEB BUSH WITH HIS LOW  ENERGY, IT IS SAD. I CAME UP WITH THAT TERM IN A  BECAME SO DEFINING. IT'S LIKE HAVING IT ON HIS FOUR HEAD.  IT IS SAD. HE RAISED $125 MILLION WHICH  MEANS HE HAS CONTROLLED -- IS  TOTALLY CONTROLLED BY THE PEOPLE  THEY GAVE HIM THE MONEY. THAT'S WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE ME MONEY. YOU WANT TO CONTROL YOUR OWN  POLITICIAN, THAT IS FINE.  THINK ABOUT THAT. FIVE WAS AGO I WAS WITH YOU. IT WAS BETTER THAN THE? -- WHO  WAS BETTER THAN THE? I GIVE 350,000 DOLLARS TO THE  REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION AND NEVER GOT A LETTER THANK YOU. $350,000. I DID NOT RECEIVE ONE LETTER,  NOT ONE LETTER FROM ONE  GOVERNOR. STUPID. BUT WHY WOULD HE GIVE ANY MORE? I DON'T GET A THANK YOU LETTER. POLITICIANS FORGET. THEY GENERALLY ARE NOT  COMPETENT. THE ONE THING THEY ARE GOOD AT  IS GETTING ELECTED AND THAT IS  WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO END UP HAVING. I WONDER SUPPORT THE DON'T WANT  YOUR MONEY.  NOW LET'S TAKE SOME QUESTIONS  OK?   HE SAID THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT  DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER GUYS.  HE DOES A GREAT JOB.   I'M GLAD YOU REMINDED ME! I DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT. I BUILDING A TREMENDOUS HOTEL.   THIS IS MUCH BETTER BUT I WILL  GO THERE RIGHT AFTER THIS. YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE MISSION OF  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL NOT  STEALING EVERYTHING YOU OFFER  NOTHING ELSE. TO SHOW YOU HOW IMPORTANT THIS ALL IS AND HOW IMPORTANT ISRAEL IS, I DON'T MENTION MY PROJECTS. IT'S NOT THAT IT'S VERY  IMPORTANT TO ME ANYMORE. WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS UNITED  STATES AND MAKING A GREAT AGAIN. MY THEME IS MAKE AMERICA GREAT  AGAIN.  IT IS TAKING OFF LIKE CRAZY. THE HATS. IT'S CRAZY. SOME OF THESE GUYS TRY TO COPY. I HAD A TRADEMARK BECAUSE WE  ARE SMART. A COUPLE OF THEM GOT UP. I WAS MAKING A SPEECH NEVER BUT  HE STOOD UP.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! BUT WE SENT THEM A LITTLE NOTICE  IS SENT ITS TRADEMARKED. -- THAT SAID IT IS TRADEMARKED. WE ARE BUILDING A LITTLE HOTEL DOWN THE ROAD.  I WAS INTERVIEWED YESTERDAY. THEY DID A VERY GOOD JOB. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS ABOUT ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS AND  WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. I SAID I'D USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE OF A BE THE HARDEST DEAL  IN HISTORY TO MAKE. WE ALL HAVE TOUGH DEALS. SOME ARE GOOD AND SOME ARE BAD. SAM? HOW ARE YOU, SAM? GOOD MAN. VERY NICE TO SEE YOU. I KNOW EVERYBODY IN THIS AUDIENCE.  BUT I SAID PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO  MAKE SACRIFICES ONE WAY OR  ANOTHER.  I'M A DEALMAKER. I BELIEVE I CAN DO BOTH SIDES  TOGETHER. BUT I SAID IT WILL TAKE SIX MONTHS. AT THE END OF SIX MONTHS AND MAYBE SOONER, WITH US WE HAVEN'T DEAL INSTINCT -- WE HAVE A DEAL  INSTINCT. YOU CAN TELL IN TWO SECONDS  WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO  MAKE A DEAL.  I WILL KNOW QUICKLY IF I CAN PUT  THE DEAL TOGETHER. I USE THAT IN THIS INTERVIEW WITH PERHAPS THE HARDEST DEAL IN  HISTORY TO PUT TOGETHER.  THERE IS PROBABLY NO TOUGHER  DEAL. IT WOULD MAKE ME SO HAPPY  BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH  VIOLENCE IN SO MUCH THAT -- DEATH. I SAID YOU HAVE TO HAVE A  COMMITMENT TO MAKE. I DON'T KNOW THAT ISRAEL HAS A  COMMITMENT TO MAKE IT AND I  DON'T KNOW IF THE OTHER SIDE HAS  THE COMMITMENT TO MAKE IT.  WITH THAT SAID, WE HAVE A GOOD  CHANCE OF WINNING IF YOU LOOK AT  WHAT IS GOING ON. AS A DEALMAKER I DON'T THE GIVE AWAY A LOT OF CARDS ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS AND THAT.  I WOULD SAVE IT FOR THE VOTE -- MOMENT WHEN YOU WALK INTO THE  ROOM.  I THINK PEOPLE KNOW WHERE I  STAND. WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF THEY  COULD MAKE A DEAL?  NOT A PHONY DEAL THE LAST A WEEK AND THEN THAT THING START  HAPPENING AGAIN.  I WILL GIVE IT. OBAMA SAID IT WILL NOT HAPPEN DURING -- HE GAVE UP ON THIS  BEFORE IT STARTED. I THINK IT WILL BE A GREAT THING FOR ISRAEL AND A GREAT THING FOR BOTH SIDES IS A REAL DEAL TO BE  MADE. I WILL GIVE IT MY BEST. I'M A GREAT DEAL MAKER. I'VE MADE A LOT OF MONEY. I WILL GIVE IT MY BEST. IT WOULD BE GREATER THAN DEAL TO BE MADE.  ISRAEL HAS GIVEN A LOT. I THINK THE PUBLIC RELATIONS FOR  ISRAEL HAS NOT BEEN SO GREAT.  ISRAEL HAS GIVEN A LOT BUT HAS  NOT BEEN GIVEN A LOT OF CREDIT  FOR WHAT THEY HAVE GIVEN.  I DON'T KNOW IF YOU AGREE WITH  THAT.  SOMETHING SIPPING GIVEN WHICH WERE UNTHINKABLE. -- SOME THINGS WERE GIVEN THAT WERE  UNTHINKABLE. I WOULD LIKE TO GO IN WITH A  CLEAN SLATE AND SAY EVERYBODY IS  EVEN AND WE LOVE EVERYBODY AND  LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO  SOMETHING. I DO THINK THIS AND RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, AND I'M SAYING IT NOW EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT CONNECT  THE HOBBY LATER ON.  IT HAS TO BE SAID THAT ISRAEL  HAS GIVEN A LOT. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY  WANT TO GO THAT FAR IN THE FINAL  STEP IN A WILL BE UP TO THEM.  ISRAEL HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN THE  CREDIT THAT THEY DESERVE FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE.  I WILL SAY THAT. THAT IS IT.  I WANT TO WAIT UNTIL  HE MEET WITH BB. I'M LEAVING FOR ISRAEL.  IT WAS THE WISEGUY. RELAX. YOU LIKE ME VERY MUCH. AND YOU WONDER WHAT YOU GET  YOURSELF IN TROUBLE. YOU WILL LIKE ME VERY MUCH. AGAIN, YOU CANNOT GO IN WITH  THAT ATTITUDE. YOU CAN MAKE A GREAT DEAL EDUCATED -- BUT YOU CAN'T DO  WHEN WITH THE ATTITUDE NEVER  BEEN TO SHOVE IT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.  YOU WILL BE VERY HAPPY.   I THINK HE IS BEEN  TREATED VERY BADLY. I THINK OUR PRESIDENT HAS BEEN  UNBELIEVABLY RUDE TO BB. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE LIKE BB BUT I THINK HE WAS RUDE. WE WILL TALK ABOUT DEALS AFTER  THE FACT WHICH IS A SHAME. I THINK IRAN DEAL IS THE WORST  SINGLE THING PERHAPS, AND I HAVE  BEEN PRETTY GOOD AT PREDICTING  THINGS.  I THINK ILL BE THE WORST -- I  THINK IT WILL BE THE WORST  SINGLE THING EVER TO HAPPEN TO ISRAEL.  I THINK FOR OBAMA TO MAKE A DEAL AND FOR ANYBODY THAT LOVES  ISRAEL TO SUPPORT HIM OR THE  DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS IMPOSSIBLE  TO BELIEVE.  I THINK HE WILL BE ONE OF THE  GREAT CATASTROPHES.  BUT IF I GET IN, I WILL  STRAIGHTEN IT OUT.  IT WILL BE STRAIGHTENED OUT. IT WILL BE STRAIGHTENED TOUGH AND FAST.  IF I GET IN, THE $150 BILLION IS  GONE. THAT HURTS ME AND IT HURTS THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. THE $150 BILLION IS GONE BECAUSE  IT WILL BE GONE BEFORE WE CAN  GET THERE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A YEAR AND  MORE. ALTHOUGH THE ELECTION IS VERY  QUICK COMING UP. IT IS NOW LESS THAN A YEAR. WE HAVE THE I WAS STARTING ON  FEBRUARY 1 -- IOWA STARTING ON FEBRUARY 1. FOR A PERSON LIKE ME IT'S VERY  EXCITING.  I HAVE NOT BEEN  WORKING TOO MUCH WITH THE ARAB  LEADERSHIP. I MAKE COMMERCIALS FOR BB AND I  DO NOTE THAT WILL HAPPY WITH THE  NEGOTIATION.  I DID PEOPLE SCREAMING AT ME -- I GET PEOPLE SCREAMING AT ME. THE KING OF JORDAN SEEMS LIKE A  NICE MAN. I DON'T KNOW. WE WILL SEE. A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE HIM AND  SOME PEOPLE DON'T. I THINK I WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE -- I TOOK SOME HEAT BECAUSE I  GET ALONG WITH DEMOCRATS AND  LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES AND  REPUBLICANS. THAT IS WHAT I WAS. I WAS A BUSINESS PERSON AND I  GET ALONG WITH EVERYBODY.  WE HAVE TO GET ALONG WITH EVERYBODY.  I SAY WAIT A MINUTE,. I'M A  BUSINESSMAN I LIVE IN MANHATTAN. IT'S ALL DEMOCRAT. REPUBLICANS DON'T EVEN WANT  PEOPLE FOR THE MOST PART. IF THEY DO, THEY WILL GET 5%. I HAVE TO GET ALONG WITH  EVERYBODY. I THINK THAT WILL BE A  TREMENDOUS ASSET. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE GRIDLOCK IN  WASHINGTON. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT THEY DON'T  TALK. I HAVE BEEN A VERY POLITICAL PERSON, ALWAYS. YEARS AGO, THE REPUBLICANS AND  DEMOCRATS, THEY LIKED EACH OTHER, THEY GOT ALONG. WE WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THINGS, BUT, IN THE EVENINGS, THEY WOULD GO OUT AND HAVE DINNER TOGETHER WITH THEIR  FAMILIES. YOU DON'T SEE THAT ANYMORE. THERE IS TOTAL HATRED AND TOTAL GRIDLOCK.  I WILL GIVE YOU ONE POINT. YOU HAVE COUNTRIES LEAVING THE  UNITED STATES. THEY ARE LEAVING FOR BETTER TAXES, AND A LOT OF THINGS. PFIZER.  HOW BIG IS PFIZER?  THOUSANDS OF JOBS WILL BE LOST.  THEY ARE ALSO LEAVING BECAUSE WE HAVE $2.5 TRILLION -- AT LEAST -- THAT IS OUT OF DRINK AND  THESE COMPANIES CANNOT GET BACK BECAUSE OF BUREAUCRACY AND  HORRIBLE AGREEMENTS, BUT BECAUSE THE TAXES ARE TOO HIGH. THEY ACTUALLY TAKE THE COMPANY,  AND MOVE THE COMPANY TO THE  MONEY. THE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TOTALLY AGREE THAT THE MONEY  SHOULD COME BACK. FOR THREE YEARS, THEY CANNOT GET A DEAL.  THERE IS NO LEADERSHIP. IT IS GRIDLOCK.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING -- ALL THE PEOPLE APPEAR, THEY  ALL AGREE. THEY ARE POLITICIANS.  ALL TALK, NO ACTION.  IT IS NOT LIKE SOMETHING WHERE  THEY CAN'T AGREE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY AGREES, THE MONEY SHOULD POUR  INTO THIS COUNTRY, WE SHOULD USE  THIS MONEY. THEY AGREE, AND THEY CANNOT GET IT DONE BECAUSE OF GRIDLOCK AND INCOMPETENT LEADERSHIP.  HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN SAY. SHE SAYS SHE IS, BUT ALL OF A  SUDDEN, SHE SAYS MAYBE LESS SO  THAN YOU THOUGHT BECAUSE SHE IS GOING FAR TO THE OTHER SIDE.  BERNIE SANDERS HAS BROUGHT HER TO POSITIONS THAT SHE DID NOT  WANT TO BE AT P A YOU LOOK AT  SOME OF THE THINGS SHE IS SAYING  RIGHT NOW. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, SHE DOES  NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH OR ENERGY  TO HELP ISRAEL.  SHE DOESN'T.   TAKE A LOOK. SHE WILL COME OUT AND DO AN EVENT, AND THEN YOU DO NOT SEE  HER FOR ANOTHER 3-5 DAYS. IT'S TRUE. SHE DOES NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH OR ENERGY. ISRAEL NEEDS MORE THAN JUST OUR  SUPPORT, THEY NEED STRENGTH.  THEY NEED REAL POWER.  YOU LOOK AT THE COUNTRIES, AS  THEY FALL OVER THERE, AND ISRAEL  HAS SOME DIFFICULTIES. ONE THING, AND I THINK YOU WILL ALL ADMIT IT, THESE PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING REALLY DIRTY.  THEY FIGHT BETTER THAN WE USED TO THINK.  15 YEARS AGO, WITH MY FRIENDS  FROM ISRAEL -- I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS FROM ISRAEL -- THEY USED TO SMILE AND LAUGH. NOW, THEY ARE SAYING, THEY ARE  DIRTY FIGHTERS. THEY ARE TOUGH. THEY ARE NOT THE JV. OBAMA SAID THEY ARE THE JV.  THEY ARE NOT, FOLKS. THEY ARE TOUGH. WE NEED GENERAL GEORGE PATTON, MACARTHUR. I DO NOT WANT MY GENERALS ON TELEVISION SAYING, ISIS IS VERY  TOUGH. I SAW A GUY THE OTHER DAY  SAYING, ISIS IS VERY TOUGH, I  DON'T KNOW. GENERAL GEORGE PATTON, THEY DID NOT LIKE HIM BECAUSE HE WAS FOUL MOUTHED, A BRILLIANT GUY.  HE WOULD HAVE NEVER MADE IT. WE NEED PATTON.  WE NEED A GENIUS LIKE MACARTHUR.  WE HAVE THOSE PEOPLE.  I WILL FIND THAT PERSON.  WE WILL KNOCK THE CRAP OUT OF  THEM. WE ARE GOING TO WIN.   RADICAL ISLAM --    I WILL TELL YOU ONE  THING I KNOW IT IS NOT IS GLOBAL  WARMING. THAT IS THE ONE THING I KNOW ISN'T.   WE HAVE A GUY THAT  JUST THE OTHER DAY SAID -- RIGHT AFTER PARIS -- THEY WANT TO BLOW OUR CITIES UP, DESTROY OUR  CIVILIZATION, AND HE IS WORRIED  ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING, WHICH A  LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IS A HOAX. BY THE WAY, I HAVE ONE SO MANY ENVIRONMENTAL AWARDS. I WANT A AIR, CRYSTAL WATER, I  WANT A LOT OF THINGS. GLOBAL WARMING -- YOU NOTICED A CHANGE THE NAME. THEY GO GLOBAL WARMING, CLIMATE CHANGE.  I HEAR A LOT ABOUT EXTREME  WEATHER.  HOW CAN YOU MESS WITH EXTREME WEATHER. IT IS A DISGRACE, WHAT IS GOING  ON.  TO HAVE THIS MAN AND VERIZON'S -- AND EMBARRASS US TO SAY  THAT GLOBAL WARMING IS OUR BIGGEST THREAT, WE HAVE TO GET HIM OUT SO FAST. THANK GOODNESS WE ONLY HAVE ONE  YEAR LEFT.  INC. YOU.  THANK YOU. THANK YOU,  EVERYBODY. ",Donald Trump Remarks at Republican Jewish Coalition Presidential Forum

NOW IT IS FULL. TOUGH. I KNOW. THANK YOU, DARLING.   I GUARANTEE YOU THE PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA WILL NOT REPORT THAT, BECAUSE I KNOW HOW THEIR MINDS WORK. 34% FOR TRUMP, 19% FOR CARSON, 9% FOR RUBIO, 7% FOR TED CRUZ. FLORIDA, WELL, I HAVE AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE I HAVE THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN FLORIDA. WE HAVEWE HAVE MANY BUILDINGS ON THE BEACH. WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES. I HAVE AN ADVANTAGE. BUT FLORIDA, A VERY NEW POLL. 37% FOR DROP, 16 FOR RUBIO. I WON'T TELL YOU WHAT BUSH IS, BUT IT IS NOT TOO GOOD. SO COMING OVER I WAS WATCHING THE NEWS. AND ACTUALLY TWO MAJOR ANCHORS FROM TWO DIFFERENT NETWORKS WERE VERY NICE TODAY BECAUSE THEY SAID LIKE IT OR NOT, TRUMP SAID THIS. THEY ARE BOMBING THE HELL OUT OF THE OIL FIELDS. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THAT FOR TWO YEARS BECAUSE THEY ARE TAKING THE WEALTHY WAY FROM ISIS . EVERYBODY SAID, YOU CANNOT DO THAT. I SAID WHY CAN YOU NOT DO IT? FRANKLY WE SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE TO IRAQ AMONG BUT ONCE WE WERE THERE WE SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE OUT THE WAY WE DID. AND WHEN WE DID GO ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE KEPT THE OIL, NOT JUST BOMBED THE OIL. WE SHOULD HAVE KEPT THE OIL AND WE SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THE FAMILIES OF THE GREAT SOLDIERS THAT WERE KILLED AND BADLY WOUNDED AND BADLY INJURED AND OUR WOUNDED WARRIORS, WE SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM A LOT OF MONEY FROM THOSE OIL FIELDS. WE GOT NOTHING. WE GOT NOTHING. WE GOT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. SO NOW THEY ARE BOMBING THE OIL FIELDS AND IT IS ABOUT TIME. STAND THAT WHOEVER SAID THAT. IT IS VERY SMART. IT IS ABOUT TIME. AND TWO OF THE ANCHORS GOT ON INSIDE WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT DONALD TRUMP PREDICTED IT AND HE SAID THAT IS WHAT YOU SHOULD DO. I WROTE A BOOK IN 2000, AND IN THE BOOK I MENTIONED OSAMA BIN LADEN. I SAID BAD GUY, HE IS GOING TO DO DAMAGE TO OUR COUNTRY. AND WE BETTER DO SOMETHING TO STOP HIM. THIS WAS TWO YEARS BEFORE THE WORLD CENTER -- WORLD TRADE CENTER CAME DOWN THROUGH THE AUSPICES OF HIM. AND ANOTHER ANCHOR, ON THE SHOW THE OTHER DAY, SOMEBODY GAVE HIM THE ALL CAPS ON TO DEATH -- GAVE HIM THE BOOK AND SAID TRUMP PREDICTED IT. MY NEW BOOK IS REALLY SUCCESSFUL. CRIPPLED AMERICA. I HOPE EVERYBODY WILL GO OUT AND BUY IT. IT IS VERY SUCCESSFUL. BUT HE SAID WENDY SAY OSAMA BIN LADEN IS GOING TO COME AND DO DAMAGE. THIS WAS BEFORE THE WORLD TRADE CENTER CAME DOWN. HE SAID WELLOAH. WE NEED PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING.  SO YOU JUST TAKE A LOOK. NOW WE ARE ON A SUBJECT THAT I THINK I KNOW A LOT ABOUT, IT IS CALLED IMMIGRATION. HAD I NOT COME OUT IN MY NOW FAMOUS OPEN REMARKS AT TRUMP TOWER WHEN I ANNOUNCED I WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND NOT TALKED ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION , I DO NOT THINK HE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT IT TODAY. BUT I WATCHED TED CRUZ, AND I WATCHED MARCO RUBIO, THEY ARE FIGHTING OVER WHO IS TOUGHER . I WAS TOUGHER WHEN IT WAS NOT VERY POLITICALLY POPULAR TO BE TOUGH. I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT. RUSH LIMBAUGH SAID NOBODY HAS EVER TAKEN IN MORE INCOME THAN DONALD TRUMP. AND I WAS GOING. I WAS TAKING A LUNCH OF ABUSE FROM THOSE CHARACTERS RIGHT BACK THERE. A LOT OF ABUSE. AND THEN PEOPLE STARTED TO SAY TRUMP IS RIGHT. A LOT OF PROBLEMS BEING CAUSED. HAD I NOT DONE THAT, AND HAD I NOT MENTIONED IT AS A MAJOR PART BECAUSE I HAVE FRIENDS WHO LIVE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, WHETHER IT IS TEXAS OR ARIZONA OR LOS ANGELES, WHERE THEY HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM, A HUGE PROBLEM. AND I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY. IT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. IT IS A REALLY SERIOUS PROBLEM. AND YOU HAVE GREAT PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME INTO THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. BUT YOU HAVE SOME VERY BAD PEOPLE. IF YOU CAN LOOK AT SOME OF THE GANGS AND A LEG, ROUGH GANGS. THESE ARE ROUGH DUDES. IF I GET ELECTED, IF I BECOME PRESIDENT THOSE PEOPLE ARE OUT OF HERE. THOSE GUYS ARE GONE, AND FAST. I'VE BEEN GONE. THEY ARE COMING BACK AND WAIT WAY TO PUT THEM WHERE THEY CAME FROM. WE'RE NOT GOING TO PUT THEM IN OUR PRISONS AND TAKE CARE OF THEM FOR 45 YEARS. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN THAT WAY. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN THAT WAY. SO THEY ARE GONE. AND WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL, AND IT IS GOING TO BE A REAL WALL. NOT ONE OF THESE LITTLE WALLS WERE THEY RIDE YOU TO THE TOP LOADED UP WITH DRUGS AND ROCK OUR CITIES AND THE LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN AND EVERYBODY ELSE MADE IT WILL BE A REAL WALL IT WILL BE A TRUMP WALL. I KNOW HOW TO DO IT, BELIEVE ME. YOU KNOW, SOMETHING I NEVER TALK ABOUT, THE OLD POST OFFICE, A GREAT BUILDING IN WASHINGTON DC. IN BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE CAPITAL, ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. I AM BUILDING OCCURRED EVERYBODY WANTED THAT BUILDING. I GOT IT. IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER PROPERTY. EVERY HOTEL COMPANY WANTED IT. WALLED. EVERYBODY. ALL THE HOTEL COMPANIES. HIGHEST WANTED IT. THEY ARE THE BIGGEST BACKER OF OBAMA. THEY WANTED IT. AND I GOT IT. AND I GOT IT FOR A SPECIFIC REASON. WE HAVE THE BEST PLAN. WE HAD AMONG THE BEST FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AND HE MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS DONE RIGHT. THE GSA FOLKS ARE PROTESTING -- ARE FANTASTIC PROFESSIONALS. AND NOW IT IS A HEAD OF SCHEDULE. IT WILL OPEN IN 2017. NOW WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET IT OPEN IN NOVEMBER OR BEFORE NOVEMBER OF 2016. ALMOST A YEAR AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. SO WE ARE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, UNDER BUDGET. OUR DAY NICE WORDS WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THESE BUDGETS THAT THIS COUNTRY BUILDS WHERE THEY ARE A THOUSAND TIMES ON SUCH OVER BUDGET. I'M UNDER BUDGET, AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. IT WILL BE THE GREATEST HOTEL IN AMERICA. ARTIE HAVE THE GREATEST HOTEL IN AMERICA. IT IS CHICAGO. BUT THE GREATEST HOTEL IN AMERICA. IT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE A LOT OF PEOPLE PROUD. BUT I KNOW HOW TO BUILD. IN THAT WALL IS GOING TO BE A REAL WALL. AND THAT IS GOING TO BE A REALLY POWERFUL WALL. IT WILL BE A BEAUTIFUL WALL BECAUSE SOMEDAY THEY WILL PROBABLY NAME IT AFTER TRUMP. IT HAS TO BE BEAUTIFUL. THE TRUMP WALL. IT WILL BE CALLED TO TRUMP WALL. AND IT IS GOING TO HAVE A DOOR THAT IS PRETTY BIG BEAUTIFUL DOOR BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY BECAUSE I WANT THEM TO COME AND SO DO YOU. BUT THEY HAVE TO COME IN LEGALLY. THEY HAVE TO COME IN LEGALLY. THEY HAVE TO COME IN LEGALLY. AND I SENT THE BAD ONES ARE GOING OUT SO FAST, AND THAT IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE. BEFORE WE EVEN START THE WALL. YOU KNOW THAT HILLARY CLINTON -- SHE WILL BE SO BAD. SHE WILL SET THIS COUNTRY BACK SO FAR, SO FAST. IF WE'RE TO GO THROUGH FOUR YEARS OF THIS BED LINEN, OF THIS TURMOIL WITH CLINTON, AND THE WHOLE WORLD BLOWING UP AROUND HER, YOU LOOK AT WHAT SHE HAS DONE AT SECRETARY OF STATE. THE WHOLE WORLD LOVE. WE ARE A DIFFERENT WORLD. ISIS, A ROCK, LOOK AT ALL THE BAD THINGS. LIBYA, BENGHAZI, ALL OF THESE THINGS, JUST LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE MIDDLE EAST AND LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE WORLD. AND I SAY MAYBE KERRY WILL GO DOWN AS BEING A WERE SECRETARY OF STATE THAN EVEN HILLARY. BECAUSE HE MADE A DEAL WITH IRAN. IT CAN BE ONE OF THE MOST INCOMPETENT TRANSACTIONS I HAVE EVER WITNESSED IN MY LIFE OF ANY KIND. OF ANY KIND. OF ANY KIND. SO, WE'RE GOING TO GET THE BAD DUDES OUT, WE'RE GOING TO BUILD ABOUT WALL, AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE ILLEGALLY, AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE THEM OUT AND WE ARE COUNTRY OF LAWS. WE HAVE TO REMAIN THAT WAY. WE NEED A BORDER. YOU CANNOT HAVE A COUNTRY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A BORDER. ALL OF A SUDDEN THE NEWS IS TALKING ABOUT DWIGHT EISENHOWER. EVERYBODY LIKED IKE. EXCEPT GENERAL MACARTHUR. HE DID NOT LIKE HIM TOO MUCH. GENERAL MACARTHUR NEVER UNDERSTOOD IKE. HE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE. BY THE WAY, WE'RE GOING TO FIND A GENERAL ELECTRIC ARTHUR. WE'RE GOING TO FIND A GENERAL GEORGE PATTON. WE HAVE THEM. WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT A PAC-10 OR A MACARTHUR. WE HAVE THEM. THEY ARE IN THERE SOMEPLACE. THEY DO NOT DO SO BECAUSE THEY USE FOUL LANGUAGE, THEY ARE TOUGH, THEY ARE MEAN, THERE ARE NASTY. BUT I DO NOT WANT MEAN GUYS MIGHT THINK NEED TO BE SMART. I WANT SOMEBODY REALLY TOUGH. BUT REALLY SMART. I KNOW A LOT OF TOUGH GUYS THAT THEY ARE NOT SMART. WE ARE GOING TO GET SOMEBODY. I'M REALLY GOOD THAT -- AT THAT. WE AGREE TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO IS SO TOUGH AND SO SMART AND WE'RE GOING TO BUILD UP OUR MILITARY. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT SO POWERFUL AND SO STRONG THAT NOBODY IS EVER GOING TO MESS WITH US COURAGE NOBODY. NOBODY. AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE HER BACK OUR VETERANS WERE NOT BEING TREATED IN MANY CASES AS WELL AS THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. YOU HAVE THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BEING TREATED BETTER THAN OUR VETERANS. SO WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT. BY THE WAY WE ARE GOING TO TERMINATE OBAMACARE AND WE'RE GOING TO REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING MUCH BETTER. MUCH BETTER. BUT BECAUSE THE TOPIC IS SO HOT, I'M JUST GOING TO FINISH UP WITH IMMIGRATION. WE'RE GOING TO TROUBLE UP THE NUMBER OF THE BORDER PATROL. THESE BORDER PATROLS ARE PHENOMENAL. I'M THE. I WAS IN LAREDO, TEXAS A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. THESE ARE TREMENDOUS PEOPLE. THEY WANT TO DO THEIR JOB. THEY CANNOT. THEY ARE TOLD TO STAND DOWN. STAND DOWN. PEOPLE WALK RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM, WAY BACK THEN. JUST WHAT, I BECAME AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, AND ALL OF THESE SUCKERS OUT HERE GOING TO PAY FOR ME FOR THE NEXT 85 OR 90 YEARS. THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. SO THEY ARE TOLD TO STAND ON. WHEN I'M THERE THEY ARE GOING TO BE TOLD JUST THE OPPOSITE. BELIEVE ME. AND WE ARE GOING TO TRIPLE THE NUMBER. WITH EISENHOWER'S PLAN, A LOT OF PEOPLE NEVER HEARD OF HIM. NOW THEY FOUND OUT I WAS RIGHT. JUST LIKE I AM RIGHT ABOUT ANCHOR BABIES. YOU CAN COME INTO THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, HAVE YOUR BABY, AND WE TAKE ADVANTAGE -- TAKE CARE OF YOUR BABY FLEXING FIVE YEARS. YOU DON'T NEED A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. YOU NEED IS SIMPLE ACT OF CONGRESS. HE MIGHT NOT EVEN NEED THAT. AND FOR HIS PEOPLE THOUGHT YOU GO TO MEXICO, TRY HAVING A BABY IN MEXICO AND SEE IF THAT THEY'VE WILL BE A MEXICAN CITIZEN. THEY WOULD LAUGH AT YOU SO HARD. THEY WOULD LAUGH SO HARD. WE ARE RUN BY INCOMPETENT PEOPLE. OUR LEADERS ARE INCOMPETENT. THEY ARE INCOMPETENT PEOPLE. AND I KNOW MANY OF THEM. AND NOT ONLY DON'T THEY HAVE BUSINESS ABILITY, NOT ONLY DON'T THEY HAVE HARD, THEY DON'T HAVE COMMON SENSE. AND A LOT OF IT IS COMMON SENSE. AND A LOT OF IT IS LEADERSHIP. WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO LEADER. I CAN TELL YOU THAT. SO WE WILL TRIPLE UP THE ICE OFFICERS. WE WILL GO NATIONWIDE E-VERIFY. OF WHAT PEOPLE DON'T SAY ABOUT EISENHOWER'S WITH A MOVE THEM OUT MORE THEY STARTED MOVING THEM OUT THEY MOVED OUT AT LEAST A MILLION AND A HALF. IT WAS ALSO TRUMAN THAT MOVED THEM OUT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, PEOPLE STARTED TO SEE THEY ARE MOVING THE MOUSE, AND PEOPLE STARTED LEAVING. MANY PEOPLE STARTED LEAVING. THIS IS TOO TOUGH. WE ARE GETTING OUT OF HERE. AT HIS NUMBERS OF PEOPLE JUST LEFT. AND WE NEEDED IT FROM A JOHNSON STANDPOINT BECAUSE THEY WERE TAKING JOBS AWAY FROM OUR PEOPLE. WE HAVE CLOSE TO 100 MILLION PEOPLE. OUR REAL NUMBER FOR JOBS, UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN TO 5.2%. EVERY PLACE I GO I HAVE 10,000 PEOPLE, 5000 PEOPLE. THIS ROOM WAS EMPTY ON TELEVISION TWO HOURS AGO. NOW IT WAS FULL. IF YOU HAD A REAL FIVE .2% UNEMPLOYMENT, THIS ROOM WOULD BE EMPTY AND I WOULD NOT BE DRAWN 25,000 PEOPLE TO SPEECHES. BELIEVE ME. BELIEVE ME. THAT IS THE WAY IT IS. NOW WE ARE GOING TO DEFUND THE SANCTUARY CITIES BECAUSE CENTURY CITY SORRY DISGRACE. THEY ARE THESE GRACE. I HAVE PROPERTY. I HAVE A GREAT PROPERTY IN SAN FRANCISCO. THE BANK OF AMERICA BUILDING. I LOVE SANDRA IS GO. WHEN HE WAS SHOT IN THE BACK BY AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WHO WAS HERE OR THAN FIVE TIMES, WE WILL NOT LET THAT HAPPEN AGAIN. WHEN A 66-YEAR-OLD VETERAN WAS RAPED, SODOMIZED, AND GUILT IN LOS ANGELES, WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN ANYMORE. WE WILL NOT LET IT HAPPEN ANYMORE. BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. WE ARE STOPPING WITH THE SANCTUARY CITIES. WE ARE GOING TO DO -- DETENTION, FORGET IT. WE'RE NOT WAY TO DO THE CATCH AND RELEASE. UNBELIEVABLE. THE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP, THE ANCHOR BABY, THE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP, AND IT WILL NOT HAPPEN. FUNDS OF -- HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COMING FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. IT IS A OVER. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. WE ARE GOING TO HIRE AMERICANS FIRST. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR WORKERS. DID YOU EVER HEAR OF THE DREAM ACT. IT IS NOT FOR OUR CHILDREN. THE DREAM ACT IS FOR OTHER CHILDREN THAT COME INTO THE COUNTRY. I WANT THE DREAM ACT TO BE FOR OUR CHILDREN. CIVILIANS IN A FANTASTIC HONOR TO BE WITH YOU. THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE DEALS THAT WAS VERY NICE TO ME BECAUSE I HEARD YOU'RE GIVING 20 MINUTES TO SPEAK AND I AM RIGHT ON THE ROAD IN PALM BEACH. I CAME UP, I SPEAK FOR 20 MINUTES, AND I HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB. BUT, I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN EXPRESSION BEFORE WE LEAVE. I HAVE BEEN SAYING IT MORE AND MORE. THE AMERICAN DREAM IS DEAD. BUT I'M GOING TO MAKE IT EAGER AND BETTER AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. WE WILL BRING IT BACK. WE WILL BRING IT BACK VETERANS THAN EVER BEFORE. THE ELECTION THAT IS COMING UP IS SO IMPORTANT. BECAUSE WE CANNOT GO THROUGH ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF GROSS INCOMPETENCE, BUT DIVISION. BELIEVE IT OR NOT I WILL BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. PEOPLE SAY YOU ARE A DIVISIVE FIGURE. I'VE NOT ACTUALLY. I AM THE OPPOSITE. I THOUGHT THAT OBAMA, I SAID HE IS UNQUALIFIED FOR BUT THE ONE THING HE IS GOING TO BE IS A GOOD CHEERLEADER FOR OUR COUNTRY. HE WILL BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. HE TURNED OUT TO BE A DISASTER IS A CHEERLEADER. HE TURNED OUT TO BE TOTALLY DIVISIVE. TOTALLY DIVISIVE. YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS POSSIBLE. NOT ONLY HAS HE BEEN A TERRIBLE PRESIDENT BUT HE HAS BEEN A DIVISIVE PRESIDENT. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN. SO I AM GOING TO END WITH A STATEMENT. I SEE HOW TALL OVER THE AUDIENCE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY -- STATEMENT IS. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT. THIS HAS BECOME VERY POPULAR. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER AND I REALLY BELIEVE THIS. BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE. WE ARE GOING TO WIN THAT TRADE, WE'RE GOING TO START EATING CHINA. WE HAVE A TRADE IMBALANCE WITH CHINA AT THIS YEAR IS 500 AND $5 BILLION. DO YOU BELIEVE THE -- THAT. WITH JAPAN, $70 BILLION. WITH MEXICO, WHO WILL BY THE WAY PAY FOR THE WALL. WITH MEXICO, WE HAVE AN IMBALANCE OF $45 BILLION AND GROWING ALL THE TIME BECAUSE NABISCO IS MOVING THERE. THEY ARE MOVING TO MEXICO. I'M NEVER EATING ANOTHER OR YOU AGAIN. I TELL YOU. BUT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE. AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH PRETTIER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SO PROUD OF YOUR PRESIDENT. WE ARE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH. WE'RE GOING TO WIN ON TRADE. WE'RE GOING TO WIN AND MILITARY. WE ARE GOING TO WIN WITH HEALTH CARE. WE ARE GOING TO WIN. WE DO NOT WIN ANYMORE. NOBODY CAN TALK ABOUT WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE HAD A VICTORY. WE DO NOT HAVE VICTORIES ANYMORE. WE ARE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH RATE AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE VERY PROUD OF YOUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN.  ",2015 Sunshine Summit

MY NAME IS LOUISE BURKE,   PUBLISHER, PART OF SIMON AND SHUSTER, AND I WANT TO SAY IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE. I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE A GREAT MAN, A GREAT NEW YORKER, A   GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOT AND A GREAT BEST-SELLING AUTHOR. AS PUBLISHER, I'VE HAD THE HONOR OF PUBLISHING SOME OF THE LEADING VOICE OF OUR TIME BUT  NEVER HAVE WE PUBLISHED EVERYONE WHO SEEMED TO SPEAK SO VIVIDLY FOR THE DISENFRANCHISED AND AFFECTED VOTERS, THE PEOPLE  WHO FEEL THAT NO ONE SPEAKS FOR  THEM, NOT THE DEMOCRATS, NOT   THE REPUBLICANS, NOT THE   WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT AND NOT THE MEDIA. DONALD TRUMP HAS CREATED ONE OF THE PREMIERE REAL ESTATE EMPIRES IN THE WORLD. HE'S INTELLIGENT.  HE'S A MAN THAT HAS A KEEN SENSE OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE   TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL, AND IN   ""CRIPPLED AMERICA"" HE OUTLINES PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS TO   AMERICA'S PROBLEMS.  WHAT THIS BOOK IS SAYING AND WHAT MAKES US PROUD TO PUBLISH   IT IS THAT WE CAN MAKE AMERICA   GREAT AGAIN. IN ""CRIPPLED AMERICA,"" DONALD  TRUMP EXPLAINS HOW TO MAKE AMERICA THE GREAT COUNTRY HE KNOWS IT CAN BE AND AMERICA'S BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD AND STILL TO COME. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I PRESENT  TO YOU THE MAN WHO HAS THE VISION TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT   AGAIN, DONALD TRUMP.  MR. TRUMP: THANK YOU, LOUISE.  I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. IT'S A GREAT HONOR. I WANT TO THANK YOU SIMON AND SHUSTER, ONE OF THE MOST   MAGNIFICENT PUBLISHERS FOR   YEARS AND YEARS. I HEARD ABOUT THEM AS BEING A  FABULOUS -- I WAS GOING TO SAY   THE ROLLS-ROYCE, I WAS GOING TO  SAY THE HARVARD OR THE YALE BUT  THEY REALLY ARE A GREAT ONE AND  I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'VE GIVEN US SUCH TREMENDOUS  SUPPORT AND WE DID THIS QUICKLY  AND WE THINK WE DID IT VERY EFFECTIVELY. IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE.  WE WROTE A BOOK AND THE TITLE,   ""CRIPPLED AMERICA,"" IS VERY  TOUGH, BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE  HAVE TO DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. AND I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS   WE'VE BEEN DOING SO WELL IN THE  CAMPAIGN IS BECAUSE WE TELL IT LIKE IT IS.  WE TELL THE TRUTH. AND AMERICA IS CRIPPLED. WE OWE $17 TRILLION AND $18  TRILLION AND VERY SOON IT'S  GOING TO BE $19 TRILLION IN  DEBT.  WE HAVE A MILITARY THAT DOESN'T  HAVE PROPER INSTRUCTION FROM   LEADERSHIP.  WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE'RE LOSING ALL OVER THE WORLD  WITH TRADE DEALS. EVERY COUNTRY, NO MATTER WHAT  COUNTRY YOU TALK ABOUT, YOU CAN JUST PICK A NAME OUT OF A HAT,   THEY'RE BEATING US IN TRADE AND  WE CAN NO LONGER GO LONGER.  I MENTION SERGEANT BERGDAHL. THEY GET FIVE OF THE PEOPLE THEY WANTED AND THEY WANT IT   BADLY. AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT'S  GOING TO WORK ANYMORE. SO WE WRITE ABOUT IT IN THE  BOOK. WE TELL LOTS OF DIFFERENT STORIES OF LOTS OF DIFFERENT   THINGS AND I THINK IT'S GOING  TO BE VERY INSTRUCTIONAL, VERY   IMPORTANT TO ME WAS INSTRUCTIONAL. WHEN I DID ""THE ART OF THE   DEAL,"" I THINK ONE OF THE  REASONS IT WAS SO SUCCESSFUL IS  THAT IT WAS LARGELY INSTRUCTIONAL. AND EVEN TODAY WHEN I SPEAK, SO MANY PEOPLE HOLD UP THE BOOK   ""THE ART OF THE DEAL,"" AND THE OTHER BOOKS WE'VE DONE.  SO THIS IS ONE THAT PROBABLY NOT SINCE ""THE ART OF THE DEAL""  -- I HAVE TO TELL THIS TO  LOUISE AND SIMON AND SHUSTER THAT I WORKED SO HARD ON A   BOOK.  WE WANTED TO GET IT OUT REALLY, REALLY QUICKLY SO IT REMEMBER TAINED TO WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. IT'S A MOMENT OF TIME. AND WE GOT IT DONE. AND DAVID DID A FANTASTIC JOB. WHERE IS DAVID? IS HE HERE? DAVID DID A FANTASTIC JOB. AND ALL OF MY PEOPLE DID A   GREAT JOB. THEY HELPED ME SO MUCH SO THIS   WAS NOT EASY GETTING THIS IN WE SEE THE LINES -- THE LINES GO  DOWN TO PARK AVENUE. THEY'VE BEEN FORMING SINCE LAST NIGHT. I WILL BE SIGNING BOOKS STARTING AT 12:00. WE'RE DOING A COUPLE OF INTERVIEWS AND SIGNING BOOKS AT 12:00. THAT WILL BE VERY EXCITING FOR   ME.  WE HAVE FANS THAT BOUGHT THE   BOOK AND THEY JUST BOUGHT IT   AND SOME HAVE BEEN IN LINE FOR   12, 14 HOURS.  I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE DOING   THIS BUT THEY DO IT. THEY FIND A WAY. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO  GETTING TO THE SIGNINGS. DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY  QUESTIONS, PLEASE? OH, THAT'S ALL, JUST ABOUT 30  QUESTIONS. YES, GO AHEAD. KATIE.  WELL, I THINK IT'S A DIFFERENT BOOK.  WE JUST HAD POLLS COME OUT TODAY IN IOWA WHERE I'M LEADING. YOU SAW THE NEW POLL FROM IOWA.  YOU SAW THE NEW POLL IN NEW  HAMPSHIRE WHERE I'M LEADING  BIG. A POLL JUST CAME OUT IN FLORIDA  WHERE I'M LEADING BIG. GEORGIA, TEXAS. I MEAN, ALL OVER THE PLACE.  AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, LOOK,   IT'S -- WE'RE DOING WELL.  IF YOU ADD BEN AND MYSELF,   WE'RE BEATING EVERYBODY BY A LOT. THAT SEEMS TO BE THE BIG STORY THAT WE'RE BEATING -- THEY CALL  IT THE ESTABLISHMENT.  IT'S REALLY CALLED THE FAILED  ESTABLISHMENT BECAUSE THE  ESTABLISHMENT HAS LET US DOWN  BUT I DON'T KNOW.  RILL DON'T KNOW HOW HIS BOOK -- I REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW HIS  BOOK IS DOING. WELL, I THINK MY BOOK IS VERY  HARD-HITTING. HIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF A   BOOK AND HE'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF A PERSON. MY BOOK IS VERY HARD HITTING.  IT SAYS IT LIKE IT IS. AND BASED ON WHAT SIMON AND  SCHUSTER JUST TOLD ME IT'S   SELLING LIKE HOT CAKES SO WE'LL  SEE. WE'RE VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE. WE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT   QUALITIES AND WE ARE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT. AND I'M DIFFERENT FROM ALL OF  THE OTHER CANDIDATES.  LOOK, NOBODY CAN NEGOTIATE TRADE DEALS LIKE ME. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE $00   BILLION A YEAR THAT WE'RE LOSING WITH CHINA, THAT'S GOING  TO BE TURNED AROUND. THE $75 BILLION A YEAR THAT WE'RE SHORT ON WITH JAPAN, THE   $50 BILLION A YEAR THAT WE LOSE  TO MEXICO AND THAT'S RIGHT,  THERE WILL BE A WALL BUILT.  IT WILL GO UP. IT WILL BE BUILT AND PEOPLE  WILL COME INTO THE COUNTRY LEGALLY. SO I MEAN, I'M MUCH DIFFERENT  THAN -- YOU LOOK AT MARCO  RUBIO. VERY, VERY WEAK ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. YOU LOOK AT BEN, HE'S VERY WEAK ON IMMIGRATION AND HE WANTS TO   GET RID OF MEDICARE. I MEAN, BEN WANTS TO GET RID OF MEDICARE.  YOU CAN'T GET RID OF MEDICARE. IT WOULD BE A HORRIBLE THING. IT ACTUALLY WORKS. YOU GET RID OF THE FRAUD, WASTE  AND ABUSE, IT WORKS. SO WHEN A MAN IS WEAK ON IMMIGRATION AND WANTS TO GET   RID OF MEDICARE, I DON'T KNOW HOW HE STAYS THERE. GO AHEAD, TOM.  I REALLY THINK THAT MARCO IS OVERRATED. HAD BUSH BEEN A BETTER MESSAGER, HE WOULD HAVE A  BETTER MESSAGE.  IF IT WAS ME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN  A MUCH DIFFERENT STORY.  MARCO DOESN'T GO TO THE UNITED   STATES SENATE. THAT POLL JUST CAME OUT TODAY. AND I'M WAY UP IN FLORIDA OVER EVERYBODY. BUT MARCO IS A SITTING SENATOR AND HE DOESN'T SHOW UP FOR THE   PEOPLE OF FLORIDA. AND I DON'T THINK HE SHOULD BE   DOING THAT.  NOW, BUSH GAVE A VERY WEAK MESSAGE, I AGREE WITH THAT.  IT WAS POORLY DELIVERED BUT THE FACTS ARE ON BUSH'S SIDE AND I THINK ULTIMATELY MARCO WILL BE HURT VERY BADLY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT MR. SINGER,   YOU HAVE TO SEE WHERE MR. SINGER IS COMING FROM AND WHEN   YOU SEE WHERE HE'S COMING FROM   I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO  SAY, WHOA, WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT.  BUT LOOK AT MARCO'S STANCE ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. IT'S REALLY TROUBLE FOR HIM. I DON'T SEE HOW HE CAN WIN.  OK.  YES. MARK.  MARCO RUBEO'S   PERSONAL FINANCES ARE  DISCREDITED. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT  HIS CREDIT CARD. I MEAN, HE IS A DISASTER WITH HIS CREDIT CARDS.  I TELL YOU WHAT, I LOVE FLORIDA. I'M IN FLORIDA ALL THE TIME. AND FOR YEARS I'VE BEEN HEARING  THAT HIS CREDIT CARDS ARE  DISASTER. I WOULD THINK WHEN YOU TAKE A  LOOK AT IT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THAT.  BUT HIS CREDIT CARD DEBT AND HIS PROBLEMS WITH CREDIT CARD AND WHAT HE DID WHEN HE WAS  RUNNING THE PARTY APPARATUS  WITH CREDIT CARDS, I'VE HEARD  ABOUT IT FOR YEARS.  YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND OUT. >>   WELL, HE HAS A VERY BAD RECORD OF FINANCES IF YOU  LOOK WHAT HAPPENED WITH HIS  HOUSES. HE CERTAINLY LIVES ABOVE HIS   MEANS, THERE'S NO QUESTION   ABOUT THAT.  WELL, WE'RE GOING TO LOOK -- I TELL YOU ON THE  DEBATES IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY CARE THAT MUCH. I WANT A ROOM, I WANT A PODIUM   AND LET'S GET GOING BECAUSE I  DON'T REALLY CARE THAT MUCH. BUT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CANDIDATES WHO I RESPECT   MANY OF THEM. NOT ALL BUT I RESPECT MANY OF  THEM. THEY FELT IT WAS VERY UNFAIR BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON WAS  GIVEN ALL SOFT BALLS.  I MEAN, SHE WASN'T ASKED ONE   TOUGH QUESTION.  THEY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT HER   FOUNDATION. THEY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT ANY OF  THE PROBLEMS. THEY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE EMAILS.  WHEN THE EMAIL PROBLEM CAME UP, BERNIE SANDERS LOST HIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN.  I MEAN, WHAT HE DID WAS SO   STUPID FROM HIS STANDPOINT. IN ORDER TO GET A ONE-MINUTE SOUND BITE OF APPLAUSE, HE GAVE UP EMAILS. THAT WAS THE END OF HIS CAMPAIGN.  FIRST OF ALL, PEOPLE AREN'T  GOING TO HIS RALLIES ANYMORE. HE'S FINISHED. SO UNLESS SOMETHING HAPPENS TO HER WITH RESPECT TO THE EMAILS, SHE'LL EASILY BE THE CANDIDATE. BUT I WILL SAY THIS, SHE ONLY GOT SOFTBALLS. THAT'S ALL SHE GOT. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY WE  WERE TREATED, IT WASN'T THE  SAME WAY. WITH THAT BEING SAID, I DON'T  REALLY CARE. YES.  YOUR NAME IS?  WELL, I THINK THE   REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY ARE DOING   A PRETTY GOOD JOB OVERALL. THEY COALESCED THAT LAST   DEBATE.  IT REALLY STARTED WITH ME. THE GUY ASKED ME A QUESTION. I THINK HARWOOD IS PROBABLY FINISHED AS A CREDIBLE REPORTER.  HE'S A DISASTER. AND IT WAS SUCH A HORRIBLY PUT   QUESTION AND SO OBVIOUS, AND   THE REPUBLICANS COALESCED AROUND EACH OTHER. IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY BEAUTIFUL WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT   IT.  AND ALL WE WANT TO DO IS BE  TREATED FAIRLY.  BUT WITH ME, I DON'T CARE THAT   MUCH.  JUST GIVE ME A PODIUM. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THIS, THE NETWORKS HAVE MADE A FORTUNE   BECAUSE OF ME. NOT BECAUSE OF ANYBODY ELSE. YOU KNOW, THEY WERE SAYING THAT  THE LAST CYCLE, THEY HAD TWO   MILLION AND ONE MILLION PEOPLE   AND THE NETWORKS DIDN'T WANT TO  BROADCAST IT BECAUSE NOBODY WATCHED, OK. NOBODY WANTED TO WATCH.  NOW THEY HAD 25 MILLION PEOPLE,  24 MILLION PEOPLE, 23 MILLION  PEOPLE AND 16 MILLION PEOPLE.  I MEAN, GIVE ME A BREAK. SO SOMEBODY SAID, HOW DID THEY   GET THERE? AND ACTUALLY VARIETY AND   HOLLYWOOD REPORTER WHO DO  REPORT THIS STUFF PRETTY WELL,   MUCH BETTER THAN THE POLITICAL   PRESS, SOLELY FOR ONE REASON IS  TRUMP. I'LL TAKE THE CREDIT.  I TELL YOU WHAT I ALSO WANT, I   THINK THAT WOUNDED WARRIORS AND  OUR VETERANS SHOULD BE GIVEN SOME OF THE ENORMOUS PROFITS BEING MADE ON THESE DEBATES, ENORMOUS PROFITS.  BY THE WAY, BEYOND ANYTHING  THEY EVER ENVISIONED.  CNN WAS GOING TO GET $2,000 FOR 30-SECOND AD. THEY ENDED UP GETTING $215,000.  THEY WENT FROM $2,000 TO   $215,000 FOR A 30-SECOND AD. THE NETWORKS AND CABLE ARE MAKING A FORTUNE AND I THINK   THEY SHOULD GIVE SOME OF THE   PROFITS TO THE WOUNDED WARRIORS  AND THE VETERANS. THAT'S WHAT I WANT.  I'M GIVING THEM   AWAY.  I'M GIVING THE PROFITS OF MY   BOOK, I'M GIVING THEM AWAY TO  -- INCLUDING THE VETS. OK.  WHO YOU WITH? OK, GOOD. NEW FORM OF REPORTING. DO YOU BELIEVE IT? THEY USED TO COME UP WITH CAMERAS. THEY USED TO COME UP WITH A CELL PHONE.  GO AHEAD.  SPEAK FAST.  I HAVE BEEN AMAZING   WITH RESPECT TO THE HIRING OF WOMEN. THIS BUILDING WAS BUILT AS THE HEAD PERSON WHO WAS FANTASTIC BY A WOMAN AND THAT WAS A TIME   YOU DIDN'T SEE IT IN THE   CONSTRUCTION TRADES. I MEAN, IT WAS TOTALLY UNIQUE. I HAVE MANY, MANY EXECUTIVES UPSTAIRS AND IN DIFFERENT  BUILDINGS THAT I HAVE THAT ARE WOMEN. MANY. A PROPORTION OF 50%. MIGHT BE OVER 50%. THEY GET PAID A LOT OF MONEY. IN MANY CASES MORE MAN MEN   DOING THE SAME JOB. SO WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS APPRECIATED THAT ABOUT ME. I'VE -- IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT, REALLY A STANDOUT AND I'VE BEEN HONORED FOR DOING SO WELL WITH WOMEN. YES. YES, GO AHEAD. FRENCH TELEVISION. ARE YOU GOING TO BE VOTING? I DON'T THINK SO.  SO LET'S GO. WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT   THE FRENCH RIGHT NOW.  GO AHEAD.  WHAT JEB BUSH WAS   SAYING AT THE LAST DEBATE, I   DON'T KNOW BUT HE DIDN'T SAY IT  WELL.  WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION, GO  AHEAD, BEHIND YOU? YOU'RE WITH TELEMONDAYO. OH, WELCOME. WELCOME TO -- TELEMUNDO. OH, WELCOME. WELCOME TO TRUMP TOWER.  I LIKE TELEMUNDO.  I LIKE IT BETTER THAN UNIVISION. I'M SELLING IT FOR $500  MILLION. GO AHEAD.  BECAUSE THE COUNTRY   IS DOING SO POORLY.  IT'S A VERY ACCURATE TITLE.  BECAUSE THE COUNTRY IS DOING SO  POORLY.  GO AHEAD.  THAT'S GOOD. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME DEMONSTRATIONS.  GOOD.  BECAUSE IT WILL GET HIGHER   RATINGS IF THEY DO.  I THINK IT'S FINE. LOOK, I THINK THEY SHOULD  DEMONSTRATE. RATINGS WILL GO EVEN HIGHER. IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATED SHOWS EVER.  AND THEY'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT   IT.  AND I HAVE A GREAT   RELATIONSHIP, AS YOU KNOW, FROM  TELEMUNDO, WITH THE HISPANICS. YOU'VE TREATED ME ACTUALLY VERY  FAIRLY.  WON THE POLL RECENTLY IN NEVADA.  WON OTHER POLLS AND IN NEVADA I THINK I GOT 37% AND LEADING  EVERYBODY. SO I'VE HAD A GREAT  RELATIONSHIP WITH THE  HISPANICS. I HAVE WORKING FOR ME THOUSANDS RIGHT NOW, THOUSANDS OF HISPANICS. I'VE HAD TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS WORKING FOR ME. I'M A JOB MACHINE. I'M A JOB MACHINE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DOES  COME OUT IN EVERY SINGLE POLL  AND EVERY SINGLE SURVEY IS THAT  NOBODY FOR THE ECONOMY NOBODY'S EVEN CLOSE.  I AM TWO, THREE -- AND YOU SEE   THAT -- TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE   TIMES GREATER THAN ANYBODY   ELSE. AND YOU ALMOST SAY LIKE IT'S   ABOUT THE JOBS, IT'S ABOUT THE ECONOMY, THEN HOW IS ANYBODY GOING TO BEAT TRUMP, IN ALL FAIRNESS?  I'VE HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WORKERS, I'VE HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH JOBS   AND I'VE HAD AN AMAZING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HISPANICS. I THINK I'M GOING TO WIN THE HISPANIC VOTE. I THINK I'M GOING TO WIN THE HISPANIC VOTE. YEAH, I THINK I'M GOING TO GET THE NOMINATION AND I WILL WIN THE WHITE HOUSE. I THINK BEATING HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO BE EASY BECAUSE HER  RECORD IS SO BAD. OK.  GO AHEAD.  THAT'S THE QUESTION I LIKE.  HOW AM I PREPARING FOR MY  ""S.N.L.""? WELL, I'M MEETING WITH LOREN   MICHAELS IN A LITTLE WHILE. LATER ON. WE'RE GOING TO SIGN -- I GUESS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ONLINE, BUT  WE'RE GOING TO SIGN AND THEN   LATER ON THIS EVENING I'M MEETING WITH LOREN MICHAELS AND  THE WHOLE STAFF AND WE'LL START  THE PREPARATION. WE'LL PICK OUR SKITS.  AM I NERVOUS? NOT TOO NERVOUS. NOT TOO NERVOUS. WE'LL DO A GOOD JOB AND WE'RE  GOING TO HAVE A FANTASTIC SHOW.  WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF FUN. MY JEB IMPRESSION, NO, I DON'T   WANT TO DO THAT. I DON'T LIKE SHOWING A PERSON  SLEEPING AT A PODIUM.    TOM IS ASKING, CAN JEB MAKE A COMEBACK I? THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD.  VERY HARD. NOT ABOUT MONEY. I CAME UP WITH THE ENERGY. AND I JUST THINK WE NEED TREMENDOUS ENERGY BECAUSE WE   NEED A PERSON THAT HAS   TREMENDOUS PERSONAL ENERGY TO  GET US BACK ON TRACK. YOU CAN'T DO THAT WHEN YOU   DON'T HAVE THAT. I THINK MARCO IS HIGHLY OVERRATED. HIGHLY OVERRATED. HE DOESN'T HAVE IT.  AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK   AT HIS STANCE ON THINGS. JEB, HE LACKS THE QUALITY THAT   YOU NEED. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EVERYBODY  IN THE WORLD IS RIPPING US OFF. YOU NEED A VERY STRONG PERSON WITH TREMENDOUS ENERGY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, FOLKS. I'LL TAKE THE JOB. BUT -- AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT. AND BY THE WAY, BEN CARSON DOES NOT HAVE THAT ENERGY.  WE NEED SOMEBODY WITH  TREMENDOUS ENERGY TO STRAIGHTEN  OUT THE MILITARY, TO STRAIGHTEN OUT ISIS, TO STRAIGHTEN OUT OUR HORRIBLE TRADE DEALS AND DEAL WITH OBAMACARE.  YOU NEED SOMEONE WITH PERSONAL   ENERGY AS PRESIDENT. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW THAT DOESN'T HAVE ENERGY.  YOU THINK OBAMA HAS ENERGY, HE   HAS NO ENERGY AND HE'S BEEN A HORRIBLE PRESIDENT. WE NEED SOMEBODY WITH GREAT  PERSONAL ENERGY AS A LEADER SO   THAT WE CAN MAKE GREAT DEALS   WITH OTHER COUNTRIES AND DO  WELL IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT. AND CERTAINLY JEB DOES NOT HAVE THAT ENERGY, IN MY OPINION.  YOU ARE WHERE SFR FROM THE GUARDIAN. THEY TREAT ME VERY NICELY IN   SCOTLAND.  GO AHEAD. GOOD.  THANK YOU.  WELL, WE JUST WENT OVER THAT, HONESTLY. WE JUST WENT OVER THAT.  IT'S -- YOU KNOW, IT'S ONLY GOING TO MAKE IT HOTTER. OK.  ANOTHER QUESTION. GO AHEAD.  SAY IT AGAIN.  YOU'RE GOING TO SEE   WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.  YOU'RE GOING TO SEE. BUT THE WHOLE THING WITH ANCHOR BABIES I WAS RIGHT. A PERSON HAS A BABY, LIVES IN MEXICO, LIVES IN ASIA OR -- HAS  A BABY, WALKS ACROSS THE BORDER, HAS THE BABY HERE. NOW WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT   PERSON FOR THE NEXT 85 YEARS.  I DON'T THINK SO.  AND BY THE WAY, I WAS RIGHT, THEY WERE WRONG. THE 14TH AMENDMENT DOES NOT GIVE THEM CLEARANCE ON THAT. AND IF YOU WANTED TO DO THAT IN  MEXICO OR IF YOU WANTED TO DO THAT IN ALMOST ANY OTHER   COUNTRY WHERE YOU HAVE A BABY  IN THAT COUNTRY AND THAT COUNTRY HAS THAT PERSON FOR 85 YEARS, INCLUDING ALL OF THE  COSTS OF THAT PERSON, THEY   WOULD LAUGH YOU RIGHT OUT OF   THE COUNTRY. YOU WOULD BE LAUGHED OUT OF THE  COUNTRY SO FAST SO THAT TURNED   OUT I WAS 100% RIGHT.  WE'LL HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.  WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF IT   AND IT'S GOING TO BE DONE IN A   VERY HUMANE WAY BUT WE'RE GOING  TO BRING BACK OUR COUNTRY AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A WALL AND   MEXICO'S GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL.  YOU KNOW WHY THEY'RE GOING TO  PAY? AND I HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS   WITH MEXICO AND PHENOMENAL   RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE MEXICAN PEOPLE.  PHENOMENAL. THEY BUY APARTMENTS FROM ME. THEY WORK FOR ME BY THE THOUSANDS, BY THE THOUSANDS. PHENOMENAL RELATIONSHIPS, BUT  LET ME JUST TELL YOU. WE LOSE SO MUCH MONEY WITH   MEXICO IN TERMS OF TRADE IMBALANCE. $45 BILLION LAST YEAR. PLUS WE GIVE MEXICO BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THEY WILL PAY FOR THE WALL AND IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME INTO  THIS COUNTRY BUT THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN LEGALLY, SARAH. OK.  YEAH, GO AHEAD. ITALIAN DAILY NEWS.  CAN YOU TALK LOUDER?  NOBODY CAN HEAR.  A LOT OF EUROPEAN -- HE'S FROM ITALY. A LOT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE GOING TO BUILD WALLS TO STOP THE IMMIGRATION. WELL, WALLS WORK. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK ISRAEL.  WALLS WORK IF IT'S PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED. NOT THE WALLS THAT THESE   CHARACTERS, THESE POLITICIANS  THAT WE HAVE RUNNING OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE A DISGRACE ALL TALK, NO ACTION POLITICIANS,   THEY BUILD A WALL THIS BIG. THEY DRIVE CARS RIGHT THROUGH IT.  WALLS WORK.  ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO AND   SEE ISRAEL.  THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT WALLS  WORK.  OK.  GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD.  YEAH. WE NEED POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE. GOOD QUESTION, ACTUALLY. OUR COUNTRY HAS NO SPIRIT. OUR COUNTRY HAS NO GRAPH TOES. OUR COUNTRY DOESN'T FEEL GOOD  ABOUT ITSELF AND THE PRIMARY   REASON IS WE HAVE NO VICTORIES. I MEAN, WHERE HAVE WE HAD A  VICTORY? WHERE HAVE WE HAD A VICTORY IN   TRADE? WHERE HAVE WE HAD AN VICTORY -- THIS HORRIBLE DEAL WE SIGNED   WITH IRAN WHERE WE GIVE $150 BILLION AND WE LOSE EVERYTHING.  WE LOSE EVERYTHING.  IT'S A LAUGHING STOCK. WORST DEAL, WORST CONTRACT I'VE  EVER SEEN DRAWN. WE HAVE NO VICTORIES, AND I DO WRITE ABOUT IT.  WE NEED SOME POMP AND  CIRCUMSTANCE. WE NEED SPIRIT.  WE NEED A CHEERLEADER. I THOUGHT SEVEN YEARS AGO WHEN   OBAMA GOT ELECTED, THE ONE   THING I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE A  GREAT CHEERLEADER FOR THE  COUNTRY, HE'S NOT. HE'S BEEN A GREAT DIVIDER FOR  THE COUNTRY. HE'S BEEN ONE OF THE GREAT   DIVIDERS OF ALL-TIME. I'M NOT SAYING DRESS.  IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DRESS. WHAT HE SAYS HAS BEEN VERY DIVISIVE.  HE'S BEEN A GREAT DIVIDER FOR  THIS COUNTRY AND THAT SHOULD   NOT HAVE HAPPENED. OK. YES.  I'LL GO ANYWAY THEY WANT.  I DON'T CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT THE  DEBATES. LOOK.  I'M THE ONE THAT GETS ALL THE NASTY QUESTIONS REALLY. NO ONE GETS ALL THE NASTY  QUESTIONS. IN A CERTAIN WAY MAYBE THEY'RE DEFENDING YOU ALTHOUGH I'LL  TELL YOU THEY'RE NOT DOING IT  FOR THAT REASON. I THINK IT'S IRRELEVANT. I JUST -- I LIKE THE DEBATES.  I'VE HAD THE DEBATES.  I'VE DONE WELL IN THE DEBATES. AS YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE POLL  SAID I WON ALL THREE DEBATES.  NOW, I DON'T KNOW IF I DID OR  NOT BUT I CERTAINLY DIDN'T DO  BADLY. EVEN CNBC'S POLL SAID I WON THE  DEBATES. I LIKE THE DEBATES.  I THINK THEY'RE GOOD FOR ME,   BUT WE HAVE TO BE TREATED A  LITTLE BIT FAIRLY. AS AN EXAMPLE, HILLARY CLINTON, NO TOUGH QUESTIONS.  I MEAN, WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK ABOUT BILL?  WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK ABOUT ALL  OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS? NO TOUGH QUESTIONS. NOW, THAT WAS STAGED BY THE DEMOCRATS, AND FRANKLY THEY DID  A VERY SMART THING IN THE WAY THEY STAGED IT.  WELL, WE'RE GOING TO STAGE SOMETHING PROPERLY ALSO. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, I   REALLY DON'T CARE THAT MUCH. I JUST WANT TO DEBATE. I THINK IT'S HEALTHY. GETS EVERYTHING INTO THE OPEN. BUT YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE LIKE   HARWOOD THAT READ A QUESTION, BLAH, BLAH, THAT HE WROTE  CAREFULLY WROTE. HE THOUGHT HE WAS SUCH -- HIS  CAREER, IN MY OPINION, HIS   CAREER IS PROBABLY RUINED OR CERTAINLY THREATENED.  YOU CAN ASK ABOUT ANYTHING YOU   WANT.  I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO ASK ABOUT  ANYTHING YOU WANT. HILLARY HAD ONLY SOFTBALLS ALL NIGHT LONG.  IT WAS LIKE THIS, HERE,  HILLARY, HIT THIS ONE OVER THE PARK.  YEAH. GO AHEAD.  ARE YOU FROM RUSSIA? ALL RIGHT. I THINK OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA WILL BE VERY GOOD. VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS ON ""60 MINUTES"" WITH ME THREE WEEKS   AGO, RIGHT? PUTIN. AND THEY HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATINGS THEY HAD IN A LONG TIME. SO I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM TOTAL CREDIT.  BUT WE WILL HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP I THINK WITH RUSSIA.  NOW MAYBE WE WON'T BUT I BELIEVE WE WILL HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA. I BELIEVE THAT I WILL HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH PUTIN. GO AHEAD.  SOUNDS OK TO ME.  YEAH.  GO AHEAD.  WELL, I THINK THERE   ARE A LOT OF ECONOMIC ISSUES.  WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT TRADE.  WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT   DEVALUATIONS, RIGHT? WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT CORPORATE   INVERSIONS BY WHICH THE WAY  NONE OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES,  THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS  BUT WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT   CORPORATE INVERSIONS WHERE   COMPANIES ARE LEAVING OUR  COUNTRY, MASSIVE COMPANIES   BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET THEIR   MONEY BACK AND BECAUSE THEY GET LOWER TAXES ELSEWHERE AND SO   THEY'RE LEAVING AND TAKING   THEIR JOBS WITH THEM. THE CORPORATE INVERSION  SYNDROME IS A VERY IMPORTANT   THING TO BE TALKING ABOUT. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT  WEREN'T TALKED ABOUT AT THE  DEBATE.  INSTEAD THEY TALKED ABOUT  FANTASY FOOTBALL.  I MEAN, IT WAS A BIG QUESTION. FANTASY FOOTBALL.  I'M SAYING, WHAT ABOUT CORPORATE INVERSIONS?  $2.5 TRILLION AT LEAST.  I THINK IT'S PROBABLY TWICE  THAT NUMBER IS IN OTHER COUNTRIES WANTING TO COME BACK   AND BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM IS SO CORRUPT AND TERRIBLE THEY CAN'T GET THE MONEY BACK TO INVEST IN THIS COUNTRY.  SO THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT CORPORATE INVERSIONS AT THE  DEBATES. THEY TALK ABOUT FANTASY FOOTBALL.  THAT'S -- I MEAN, THOSE ARE A FEW. YEAH.  GO AHEAD, SARAH. >>   YOU HAVE TO TALK LOUD ENOUGH.  I WAS AGAINST THE   WAR IN IRAQ, YES, VERY EARLY ON. I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU. YEAH, I HAVE IT UPSTAIRS.  I DON'T KNOW. I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU UPSTAIRS.  WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND I WAS A DEVELOPER.  A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T CARE  ABOUT MY VIEW. IN 2003, 2004, BUT THERE WAS A   REUTERS ARTICLE TAKEN FROM A   MAGAZINE ABOUT MY STANCE IN  2004, I BELIEVE, IN JULY OF  2004 AND IT TALKED ABOUT MY STANCE ON HOW I FELT ABOUT IRAQ AND I SAID VERY STRONGLY EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. I SAID YOU WILL DESTABILIZE THE  MIDDLE EAST AND WHEN YOU DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST, IRAN WILL TAKE OVER IRAQ. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND THEY'LL TAKE OVER THE OIL  RESERVES, WHICH ARE AMONG THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD, AND IN ADDITION, OTHER BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN.  THE OTHER BAD THINGS ARE ISIS. I SAID THAT IN 2004, AND THAT  WAS AN ARTICLE THAT WAS TAKEN  FROM A MAGAZINE WHICH WAS PREVIOUS TO THAT.  I FELT THAT FOR A LONG TIME. IT'S A GREAT -- THAT'S YOUR BEST QUESTION THAT YOU'VE EVER   ASKED ME, SARAH. SARAH, FINALLY YOU'RE ASKING ME THIS GREAT QUESTION. SARAH FROM CNN, TERRIFIC   PERSON. DO I THINK THAT IT'S TIME FOR SOME OF THE OTHER REPUBLICANS IN THE RACE THAT ARE REGISTERING ZERO, IN A COUPLE OF CASES THEY HAVE ZERO WITH AN ARROW POINTING LESS. IT'S LESS THAN ZERO. I DON'T THINK THAT'S HAPPENING. DO I THINK IT'S TIME FOR SOME  OF THE OTHER REPUBLICAN  CANDIDATES DROP OUT? YES. THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE. WELL, I DON'T WANT TO GET PERSONAL BUT YOU CAN LOOK AT   THE POLL NUMBERS. LOOK, IF A PERSON'S BEEN CAMPAIGNING FOR FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS AND THEY'RE AT ZERO OR ONE OR 2%, THEY SHOULD GET OUT.  LIKE, YOU KNOW, LOOK AT ME.  I GO TO FLORIDA AND LOOK AT THE  NUMBERS THAT JUST CAME OUT IN FLORIDA. 37%. GEORGIA. THOSE ARE REAL NUMBERS.  THESE NUMBERS THAT THESE PEOPLE  HAVE -- AND I OFTEN ASK MYSELF   -- I ASKED MARK YESTERDAY. WHAT ARE THEY DOING? DO THEY DO THIS FOR THEIR  BRAND? BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO THINK IT'S   VERY BAD FOR THEIR BRAND.  I THINK WALKER DID A GOOD  THING. I THINK THE WAY WALKER -- HE   SAW IT WASN'T HAPPENING, WASN'T  GOING TO HAPPEN AND HE JUST GOT OUT QUICKLY. YOU KNOW, HE WAS FAVORED, DON'T  FORGET, YOU KNOW.  THAT WAS BEFORE TRUMP WAS GOING  TO HAPPEN, RIGHT?  BUT HE WAS FAVORED FOR A PERIOD  OF TIME. HE WAS FAVORED. WALKER.  GOVERNOR WALKER. THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO WIN. HE GOT OUT. I THINK THE WAY HE GOT OUT WAS   GREAT. I THINK HE DID A REALLY SMART  THING FOR HIMSELF. FRANKLY, OTHER PEOPLE SHOULD   GET OUT BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO PERSONALLY HAVE MORE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF THE UNITED STATES AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW TO SOLVE THE   PROBLEMS BECAUSE WE CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEMS.  SO IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.  PEOPLE SHOULD GET OUT, YES.  EVANCA. THEY SAID ONE OF THE BIGGEST -- IVANKA.  THEY SAID ONE OF THE BIGGEST   APPLAUSE LINES IS WHEN I TALK  ABOUT MY DAUGHTER, IVANKA. SHE WAS AT FORTUNE MAGAZINE FOR SOMETHING LIKE WOMAN OF THE  YEAR. SHE DOESN'T KNOW.  IVANKA, JUST SAY HELLO, OK.  BUT SHE'S GOING TO BE VERY   INVOLVED. AND MELANI IS GOING TO BE INVOLVED VERY SOON. OH, IVANKA IS GOING TO IOWA. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO IOWA? VERY SOON. YES, MARK. GOOD QUESTION. I WOULD SAY I DON'T SEE THREATS. WHATEVER IT IS I HAVE TO DO -- MARK SAID, WHAT ARE YOUR TOP THREATS TO YOUR CANDIDACY? I DON'T KNOW.  PEOPLE CHANGE MINDS. I'LL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. NOBODY ELSE CAN DO IT. I WILL MAKE IT, IN MY OPINION,   BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE. AND I THINK THAT'S AWFULLY   TOUGH TO COMPETE WITH. AND ONE OF THE REASONS IN MY BOOK I ACTUALLY PUT FINANCIALS IN THERE. I SHOW YOU SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENTS. AT SIMON & SCHUSTER, YOU KEPT  ME TO EIGHT OR NINE PAGES, RIGHT? AND THERE ARE FOUR AND FIVE ON   A PAGE BUT I SHOW YOU SOME OF THE GREAT DEVELOPMENTS THAT I'VE DONE THAT ARE SO SUCCESSFUL AND SO INCREDIBLE AND SO FINANCIALLY GOOD I SHOW MY FINANCIAL STATEMENT FROM A  YEAR AND A HALF AND TWO YEARS  AGO BUT NOW IT'S BETTER. I DON'T DOUGH IT IN A BRAGADOCIUS WAY BUT IT'S   SOMETHING OUR COUNTRY NEEDS  RIGHT NOW. WE ARE RUN BY PEOPLE THAT ARE INCOMPETENT. WE ARE RUN BY PEOPLE WHO IN SO MANY WORDS -- I HATE TO USE THE WORD ""STUPID,"" I HAVE TO USE IT UNLESS THEY HAVE BAD INTENTIONS  BUT I DON'T THINK THEY DO BUT  WE ARE RUN BY INCOMPETENT  PEOPLE. WE HAVE INCOMPETENT LEADERSHIP.  I MENTION CORPORATE INVERSION. THE DEMOCRATS WANT THE MONEY TO  COME BACK. WHO DOESN'T? THE REPUBLICANS WANT THE MONEY   TO COME BACK.  FOR THREE YEARS THE DEMOCRATS  HAVE SAID WE WANT THE MONEY TO   COME BACK. FOR THREE YEARS THE DEMOCRATS  AND THE REPUBLICANS AGREE 100%.  YOU HAVE TO VAST MAJORITY. MAYBE EVERYBODY. FOR THREE YEARS, GUESS WHAT,   THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING, RIGHT? THEY CAN'T EVEN GET ALONG WHEN   THEY AGREE.  SO HERE'S A THING WHERE WE CAN   TAKE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS,   BRING IT BACK INTO THIS COUNTRY  , REBUILD BIG PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY WITH IT, COMPANIES CAN   SPEND THAT MONEY WITHIN OUR COUNTRY, WE AGREE EVERYBODY  SAID IT NEEDED TO BE DONE FOR  YEARS. WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK.  A LOT OF CONTROVERSY WITH MR.  SINGER.  THERE ARE THOSE PEOPLE THAT PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE WANT HIM  TO BACK BUT WE'LL SEE. I'LL TALK TO YOU.  GO AHEAD.  THEY'LL AGREE. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THE UNFAIR QUESTIONS.  THEY WEREN'T QUESTIONS.  THEY WERE STATEMENTS.  THEY WERE GIVEN STATEMENTS IN A  SARCASTIC DISGUSTING WAY. AND BY THE WAY, I THINK BECKY  IS TERRIFIC AND I THINK CARL IS  TERRIFIC BUT I THINK JOHN HARWOOD IS NOT VERY GOOD AT  WHAT HE DOES. BUT I THINK BECKY QUICK IS A   TERRIFIC PERSON. I THINK CARL IS A TERRIFIC PERSON.  BUT I WILL TELL YOU JOHN   HARWOOD WAS A DISGRACE TO CNBC. YEAH, GO AHEAD, TOM. IT'S REALLY AN INTERESTING   QUESTION. THE QUESTION IS, SHOULD THE FED  RAISE RATES? THEY ARE NOT RAISING THEM BECAUSE OBAMA HAS ASKED THEM   NOT TO RAISE THEM. IN MY OPINION, HE WANTS TO GET   OUT OF OFFICE BECAUSE WE ARE IN  A BUBBLE AND WHEN THOSE RATES ARE RAISED, A LOT OF BAD THINGS  ARE GOING TO HAPPEN OR   POTENTIALLY GOING TO HAPPEN AND IN MY OPINION, JANET YELLIN IS HIGHLY POLITICAL AND SHE'S NOT   RAISING RATES FOR A VERY SPECIFIC REASON BECAUSE OBAMA TOLD HER NOT TO BECAUSE HE   WANTS TO BE OUT PLAYING GOLF IN  A YEAR FROM NOW AND HE WANTS TO BE DOING OTHER THINGS AND HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE A BIG  BUBBLE BURST DURING HIS ADMINISTRATION.  JANET YELLIN SHOULD HAVE RAISED THE RATES. SHE'S NOT DOING IT BECAUSE THE   OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND THE   PRESIDENT DOESN'T WANT HER TO. AND IF SHE DOES IT, YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS EVERY TIME THERE'S EVEN A THOUGHT OF RAISING THEM JUST A LITTLE BIT. AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IS OUR CURRENCY RIGHT NOW   IS NOT COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER CURRENCIES BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK   AT THE DEVALUATIONS OF CHINA, OF JAPAN, OF MANY, MANY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, THEY'RE   MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR   COMPANIES TO COMPETE WITH THEM   BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE LEADERS THAT KNOW HOW TO SAY TO CHINA, DON'T DO THAT, DON'T DO THAT, BECAUSE IF YOU DO THAT WE'RE   GOING TO PUT A BIG FAT TAX ON YOU. DON'T DO THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT, IF YOU SAID THAT  THEY WOULDN'T DO IT IF YOU HAD THE RIGHT MESSAGE. HOW ABOUT ONE MORE QUESTION? HOWIE, DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER   QUESTION? I LOVE HOWIE. ALWAYS TREATS ME SO NICE. WHO? YES. YES.  REALLY, I'M FOCUSED   ON ONE VERY BIG ELECTION. ONE VERY IMPORTANT ELECTION. THERE'S SOME PRETTY GOOD ELECTIONS. I'LL BE WATCHING THEM ON TUESDAY NIGHT BUT I'LL BE OUT THERE, WE'LL BE OUT VOTING.  BUT THE ELECTION I AM WATCHING   IS THE ELECTION FOR THE  PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED   STATES.  THAT IS GOING TO BE, IN MY OPINION, THIS WILL BE TRULY ONE  OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTIONS  WE'VE EVER HAD IN THIS COUNTRY. WE'RE SO FAR BEHIND AND WE CANNOT GO ANOTHER FOUR YEARS   WITH INCOMPETENT LEADERSHIP. GOOD QUESTION. FINE.  OK.  WHAT ELSE. ONE MORE QUESTION. YEAH.  GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD.  THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. OK.  SO SIMON & SCHUSTER CAME UP TO   ME, THEY WANTED TO DO A BOOK. THEY WANTED IT TO DO ON SUCCESS AND HOW DO YOU DO THIS AND HOW   DO YOU BUILD IT AND THAT'S WHAT  THE BOOK IS LARGELY ABOUT BUT  WE TALK ABOUT THE COUNTRY. I SAID I'LL DO IT BUT WE HAVE  TO TALK ABOUT THE COUNTRY. WHAT HAPPENED IS THEY SENT THIS  INCREDIBLE PHOTOGRAPHER UP TO  DO A BOOK COVER, TO DO A PICTURE AND HE DID SOME GREAT  -- ALMOST AS GOOD AS YOU.  MY FRIEND OVER HERE. DID SOME GREAT PHOTOS. I'M SMILING. I'M HAPPY. I LOOK GOOD. EVERYTHING WAS FINE. AND THEN HE TOOK ONE WHERE I   WASN'T LIKE REALLY THINKING ABOUT A PHOTO. AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A NASTY  PICTURE. AND THEN THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN  AND THE TITLE WAS GIVEN AND THE ONLY REALLY TERRIBLE PICTURE I   HAD WAS THAT ONE AND IT'S A  TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NASTY  PICTURE. BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CRIPPLED AMERICA AND YOU'RE  TALKING ABOUT ALL OF THE   PROBLEMS WE HAVE, I CAN'T HAVE A BIG SMILEY FACE UP THERE. SO THAT'S HOW WE PICKED IT.  SO WE PICKED THE WORST PHOTO   TAKEN OF ME. I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL SMILEY PICTURE BUT   SOMEHOW THAT DOESN'T GO WITH   THE TITLE OR THE BOOK OR FRANKLY THE CONTENTS OF THE BOOK. AND ACTUALLY SIMON & SCHUSTER  AGREED WITH ME. OK.  SAY IT AGAIN. WHAT?  ARE THE OTHER   REPUBLICANS AFRAID TO DEBATE?  WELL, SOME OF THEM SHOULD BE. THANK YOU. SIMON & SCHUSTER, THANK YOU. LOUISE, THANK YOU.    ",Presidential Candidate Donald Trump News Conference

BUT HE USED TO LOVE COMING HERE. IT WAS THE HOTTEST RESORT IN THE COUNTRY, THIS WAS A LONG TIME AGO, I WON'T SAY HOW MANY YEARS BECAUSE I LIKE TO THINK I'M A VERY YOUNG PERSON. . BUT A LONG TIME AGO.

YOU HAD 55 COURSES, ALMOST 800 ACRES RIGHT SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF MIAMI, INCREDIBLE LOCATION, RIGHT NEAR THE AIRPORT, TEN MINUTES AWAY. IT ALWAYS DID WELL, IT WAS WAS ALWAYS ONE OF THE TOP PLACES. THEN SADLY WALL STREET GOT A HOLD OF IT, THE ORIGINAL DEVELOPER, THEY'RE GOING TO PAY TAXES, THEIR FRIENDS AND MY BUT THEY'RE GOING TO PAY. YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENS IS IT BECAME A MONEY THING. IT WAS LIKE PLAYING CARDS, BING, BEING AND THEY TRADED, AND EVERY THREE YEARS SOMEBODY WOULD MAKE A LOT OF MONEY IT WAS LIKE MUSICAL CHAIRS. AND THEY SELL IT AND THEN SOMEONE WOULD OWN IT FOR THREE OR FOUR, OR FIVE YEARS. THEN THEY WOULD SELL IT AND MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. EVERYBODY MADE A LOT OF MONEY. EXCEPT FOR THE LAST GROUP THAT I BOUGHT IT FOR. IT WAS LIKE MUSICAL CHAIRS. I BOUGHT IT AND WHEN I BOUGHT IT I BOUGHT IT FROM A SMART GROUP, THE MARKET HAD CRASHED, YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THE CRASH. I GOT. I GOT IT FOR THE RIGHT PRICE, I SIGNED FOR X DOLLARS, A LOT OF MONEY, 170 MILLION, BUT THEN I SAID MAYBE I I SAID MAYBE I CAN MAKE A BETTER DEAL BEFORE A CLOSE. SO I WENT INTO CLOSE IT WITH E VACCA, WE KNOW IVAR, IVAR, WE LOVE A VODKA, RIGHT? . RIGHT? I I WENT IN WITH THE VACA AND I SAID WATCH, LET'S SEE IF WE CAN MAKE $20 MILLION.

THEY SAID YOU HAVE TO PAY IT. YOU HAVE TO PAY IT, BEAUTIFUL GUYS, YOU HAVE TO PAY IT, YOU REALLY HAVE TO. AND AND I SAID THERE'S NO WAY. THAT'S ALL RIGHT.  >> THEY ARE GREAT. THAT IS WHAT THE COUNTRY IS ALL ABOUT. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE BE A LITTLE BIT DISRUPTIVE. IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG. IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG.

I HAVE GONE ALL OVER AND IS NOT FAIR WHAT YOU ARE SELLING ME, I'M NOT CLOSING THIS DEAL, I WILL GIVE YOU 100. REMEMBER I WANT TO IMPRESS MY DAUGHTER. THEY HONORED THE DEAL. AND I MEANT IT. IT WASN'T IN THE SHAPE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. SO I RANTED AND WRITE LIKE A LUNATIC FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES ABOUT CONDITIONS, THEY SAID WE ARE NEVER GOING TO CUT 10 CENTS. WITHIN ABOUT TWO MINUTES THEY SAID WOULD YOU TAKE $20 MILLION OFF? THEY SAID WOULD YOU AGREE TO 20 MILLION MR. TRUMP? I SAID NO WAY YOU HAVE TO DO LESS. SO WITHIN ABOUT FOUR MINUTES I SAID, $25 MILLION AND THEY CUT THE PRICE. AND THEY SAID, AND I'M ONLY TELLING THE STORY BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE DOING THE SAME THING FOR OUR COUNTRY . RIGHT. SO MY DAUGHTER WAS VERY IMPRESSED AND I MEAN, THE WHOLE WHOLE THING TOOK LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES. THE ACTUAL NUMBER AFTER TAXES, I ACTUALLY SAVED, I ACTUALLY SAVE $20 MILLION. I JUST SAID HE VACA, WE SAID HE VACA, WE JUST BOUGHT THE FURNITURE, THAT'S VERY NICE. SO THEN I HAD A DECISION TO MAKE. WE HAD THIS GREAT PLACE.

IT HAS NOT BEEN LIKE THIS SINCE MEDIEVAL TIMES, IT'S TRUE. AND SHE'S TALKING ABOUT MY TONE.  >> THINK OF IT, THINK OF HOW CRAZY AND HOW LOPSIDED OUR COUNTRY HAS BECOME. THINK OF WHAT IS GOING ON. THINK OF WHY WE ARE NOT RESPECTED. THINK ABOUT SERGEANT BERGDAHL, A TRAITOR, A TRAITOR. HE IS A DIRTY ROTTEN TRAITOR. SIX PEOPLE DIED GOING AFTER HIM. THEY DIED, 6-YARD INCREDIBLE BRAVE PEOPLE DIED. THE DEAL IS, WE GET TRAITOR BERGDAHL, THEY GET FIVE OF THE BEST PEOPLE THAT THEY  V+  HAVE  V+  THAT  V+  THEY  V+  HAVE  V+  BEEN  V+  AFTER  V+  FOR  V+  TEN  V+  YEARS.

WE CAN'T BELIEVE WE GET AWAY WITH THIS. THEY ARE INCOMPETENT. WE WERE ONLY KIDDING. THEY HAD NO IDEA I WOULD BE REVEALING THE CONVERSATION. THEY CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE. FIRST OF ALL, THERE IS NO TAX, NO NOTHING. WHEN WE SEND CHINA NUMBER ONE THEY WON'T ACCEPT THEM. IF THEY DO, THEY HAVE MASSIVE TAXES AND TARIFFS. IS A ONE-WAY STREET, ONE-WAY STREET. A FRIEND OF MINE, GREAT MANUFACTURER, CANNOT GET HIS GIVES IN. CAN'T GET HIS GIVES IN CHINA. I CAN DEAL WITH THESE PEOPLE. AND THEN FINALLY GETS THE MEN AND THEY CHARGE THEM ATTACKS THAT WAS SO HIGH I CAN TELL YOU BECAUSE NO ONE WILL BELIEVE HOW I HAD WAS. THESE ARE SMART PEOPLE. I HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE SMARTER. I HAVE PEOPLE. I HAVE SOME OF THE GREAT BUSINESSES THAT ARE ALL CALLING ME. THESE GUYS, FRIENDS OF MINE, ALL ENEMIES. I HAVE GUYS THAT ARE SO SMART AND SOME I DON'T LIKE, SOME I CAN'T STAND. SOME ARE HORRIBLE PEOPLE. ACTUALLY, I NO ONE THAT IS SO BAD AS A HUMAN BEING, THE WORST HUMAN BEING I'VE EVER MET, BUT HE IS AN UNBELIEVABLE NEGOTIATOR. COME ON. YOU'REON.

SOMETHING HIGHLY OVERRATED, OVERRATED, SOME THAT NOBODY EVER HEARD OF THAT ARE BETTER THAN ALL OF THEM. WE HAVE THE MOST TALENTED PEOPLE THERE ARE. THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE POLITICAL. NOW, IF I TELL CARL, GO WATCH OVER CHINA FOR ME, CARL, JUST WATCH OVER CHINA, TRUST ME, GOOD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN FOR US. BELIEVE ME. REALLY GOOD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. II MEAN, WE HAVE A THING RIGHT NOW GOING ON CALLED CORPORATE INVERSION. COMPANIES HAVE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THIS MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT, NO ONE REALLY KNOWS. AT LEAST TWO AND A HALF TRILLION COME ALL THESE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, AND WHAT WE ARE DOING IS OUR COMPANIES ARE GOING TO END OF ALREADY STARTED LEAVING THE UNITED STATES AND MOVING TO THOSE OTHER COUNTRIES TO GET THEIR MONEY -- WELL, BUT YOU CANNOT BLAME THEM. TO GET THEIR MONEY AND LOWER TAXES. WAY DOWN FOR CORPORATIONS, FOR THE MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE. FOR THE MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE. OF WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE TOO MANY IN THIS ROOM, I CAN TELL YOU. THEY ARE ALL UPPER MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE AND UPPER PEOPLE. THE MIDDLE CLASS IN THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN TOTALLY FORGOTTEN ABOUT, TOTALLY FORGOTTEN ABOUT. SO WE ARE CUTTING CORPORATE TAXES, TAXES FOR THE MIDDLE INCOME, CUTTING THINGS LIKE CARRIED INTEREST. THESE HEDGE FUND GUYS PICK A STOCK. IF IT GOES UP THEIR GENIUSES AND MAKE A FORTUNE. IFA FORTUNE. IF IT GOES DOWN THEY FIND ANOTHER JOB. A LOT OF IT IS LIKE. WHAT HAPPENS IS THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS BOTH AGREE THAT WE SHOULD BRING THEM. WHO COULD NOT AGREE.

THERE GOING TO STOP IT. THE OTHER DAY, AND IT IS GOING TO BE AMAZING. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A DYNAMIC COUNTRY. THE OTHER DAY I WATCHED THE GENERAL BEING INTERVIEWED. AND I SAID TO A GROUP BEFORE, WHY THE HELL IS A GENERAL BEING INTERVIEWED ON TELEVISION? I DON'T WANT MY GENERALS BEING INTERVIEWED. I DON'T WANT THEM TELLING WHAT WE ARE DOING, WHERE WE ARE GOING. CAN YOU IMAGINE GENERAL GEORGE PATTON WHO USED TO WALK IN A ROOM WITH BLOOD POURING OUT OF HIS EYES, DO YOU THINK THIS GUY IS GOING TO BE INTERVIEWED ON CNN? I DON'T THINK SO. I MEAN,, I AM WATCHING THIS GENERAL BE INTERVIEWED COMMEND THE 1st THING IS THAT I LOVE GREAT GENERALS. ELEVATE FAN OF ACADEMICS. IN THE HIGHEST MARKS IN THE HISTORY OF WEST POINT, HIGHEST AVERAGE. YOU KNOW, SMART GUY. THE BIGGEST GUY. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS HE HATED TO LISTEN TO DWIGHT EISENHOWER BECAUSE DWIGHT WHOHE WAS A GREAT GUY, BUT HE WAS AT THE LOWER PART OF HIS CLASS. AND HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT HE HAD TO TAKE ORDERS FROM MIKE. I MEAN,, SO MANY INTERESTING THINGS. COULD YOU IMAGINE GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR BEING ON TELEVISION SAYING THE FOLLOWING, THE QUESTION WAS BY HAVE VERY GOOD MAN ASKING THE QUESTIONS SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ISYS, CAN WE WIN? AND THE GENERAL LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID, IT IS GOING TO BE TOUGH. IT IS GOING TO BE VERY, VERY TOUGH. I DON'T KNOW. DON'T KNOW. IT WILL TAKE A VERY, VERY LONG TIME. WHEN YOU DO DEALS HIS PEOPLE. I WILL FIND THE SMARTEST. IT WAS TOUGH AND MEAN AND NASTY. I WILL FIND THE GENERAL MACARTHUR, I WILL FIND THE GENERAL GEORGE PATTON. WE'VE GOT THEM. WE'VE GOT THEM. THEY MAY NOT BE POLITICALLY CORRECT. WHO CARES. WHO CARES. BUT WE ARE GOING TO FIND THEM. AND WE ARE GOING TO CLEAN THINGS UP AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT COUNTRY AGAIN. AND RESPECTED. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A RESPECTED COUNTRY. SO, WE HAVE A LOT TO DO. WE WILL BUILD THE WALL. WE WILL BUILD THE WALL. THEY HAVE NO CHOICE. AND BY THE WAY, PEOPLE WILL COMMENT OUR COUNTRY, BUT THERE GOING TO COME IN LEGALLY. LEGALLY.   >> I APPRECIATE WHOEVER YELLED OUT WE WILL BUILD THE WALL BECAUSE I WAS NOT SO SURE I SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THAT. TOMORROW IN JACKSONVILLE I CAN TALK ABOUT WALLS.

BY THE WAY -- AND I SAY THIS ALL THE TIME, A RADIO HOST, HISPANIC SHOW IN NEW YORK SAID,SAID, YOU KNOW, HE WAS INTERVIEWED AND SAID, YOU KNOW, MY AUDIENCE IS ALL HISPANIC, THEY LOVE TRUST. LET ME TELL YOU, LET ME TELL YOU WHO WANTS TO STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MORE THAN ANYBODY, THE HISPANICS THAT ARE IN OUR COUNTRY LEGALLY. IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. SO, JUST TO FINISH UP, OUR COUNTRY DOES NOT WIN ANYMORE. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? AND MY RIGHT? WE DON'T WIN. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE HAD VICTORY? WE LOSE WITH CHINA ON TRADE, WE LOSE WITH I SIS, A RACK. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING. EVERY AND JUST MADE THE SINGLE GREATEST CONTRACT I HAVE EVER SEEN ANYBODY MAKE. WE WERE REPRESENTED BY A MAN THAT SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF. A MAN, SECRETARY KERRY, THIS SHOULD GET THE HELL OFF A BICYCLE.

WE'RE GOING TO WIN ON TRADE. WE'RE GOING TO WIN AT EVERYTHING. THEY ARE GOING TO TERMINATE OBAMA CARE.  IT'S GOING TO BE TERMINATED. IT IS GOING TO BE REPLACED WITH SOMETHING MUCH BETTER AND MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE FOR YOU AT FOR THE COUNTRY. LET ME TELL YOU, OBAMA CARE WAS A DREAM FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. THEY HAVE MADE A FORTUNE WITH IT. AND YOUR PREMIUMS ARE UP 40%, 50%, 55%. YOUR DEDUCTIBLES ARE 55 PERCENT. YOUR DEDUCTIBLES ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. YOU WILL NEVER EVEN BE ABLE TO USE IT.

WELL. NO LABELS. THAT'S RIGHT, I AM A BELIEVER. YOU KNOW, JOHN AND JOE CALLED AND SAID, WILL YOU DO IT? THIS WAS TWO MONTHS AGO. I SAID, I THINK I WILL BE ABLE TO. THEY EXPLAINED WHAT NO LABELS MEANT. THAT IS WHERE WE NEED TO GO ON THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING NOTHING DONE WHATSOEVER. I SAID, I AM PRETTY SURE I WILL BE ABLE TO DO IT. THE NEXT DAY THEY ANNOUNCED I WOULD BE THERE WITHOUT QUESTION. RIGHT? THEY ARE TOUGH NEGOTIATORS. I HAD ANOTHER PROBLEM. I HAD ANOTHER'S MEET SOMEPLACE, IT WAS QUITE A BIT OF A PROBLEM. I TOLD HIM I WOULD NOT DO IT. THEY ARE PROBLEM SOLVERS. THEY WENT NUTS. THEY WERE NOT HAPPY PEOPLE. IS THAT RIGHT, JOE AND JOHN? ULTIMATELY, I SAID, I MAY HAVE GONE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT 50% LEVEL. SO HERE I AM. RIGHT? HERE I AM. I LOVE NEW HAMPSHIRE. AS JOE SAID, THE LATEST POLL CAME OUT. 32 TO 14,  AND I HAVE THE 32, WHICH IS EVEN BETTER. SOME IT IS SAID, WHY DID TODD ABOUT THE POLLS? I SAID, BECAUSE I AM WINNING. I SAID, BUT NOBODY ELSE TALKS ABOUT IT. THAT IS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT DO WELL. IF THEY DID WELL, THEY WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE POLLS. WE HAD 32 TO 13. THAT IS A BIG GAP. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE FRIENDS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. THEY ARE AN PEOPLE. I APPRECIATE IT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT NO LABELS AND GETTING ALONG, AND I AM NOT GOING TO SAY IT MUCH, BECAUSE TIP O'NEILL RONALD REAGAN, YOU PROBABLY HEAR IT ALL THE TIME. DIFFERENT VIEWS. DIFFERENT EVERYTHING. A LIKED EACH OTHER. AND THEY GOT ALONG. THEY GOT THINGS DONE. THEY HAD A LEADER AND RONALD REAGAN. BECAUSE ULTIMATELY, IT IS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. MORE SO THAN YOU COULD IMAGINE. IF THE PRESIDENT IS A REAL LEAD HER, OR SHE IS A REAL LEADER, YOU WILL GET THINGS DONE. BUT YOU NEED THE LEADERSHIP TO COME FROM THE VERY PINNACLE. FROM THE VERY TOP. IF IT DOES NOT, IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. IT IS NOT HAPPENING NOW. PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING TOGETHER. I SEE IT. I HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR A LONG TIME. PEOPLE SAY, OG. I WAS VERY ESTABLISHMENT. I GAVE SO MUCH MONEY. I WAS ALL ESTABLISH MY WHEN I GAVE CONTRIBUTIONS. WHEN I STARTED TO RUN, I WAS ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT. WE CANNOT TAKE A CHANCE ON A LOSS. I WATCHED PREVIOUSLY. I WAS SERIOUSLY THINKING ABOUT IT. I DECIDED NOT TO. I THOUGHT IT WAS A RACE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN WON. SHOULD HAVE BEEN WON. I DON'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. BECAUSE I THINK, REALLY IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED, FOUR YEARS AGO, THE TIMING WAS RIGHT. EVERYTHING WAS RIGHT ALL STOP IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE. IT IS GOING TO BE DONE THIS TIME. HOPEFULLY IT IS GOING TO BE DONE BY ME. I THINK WE WILL HAVE A RESULT THAT WILL BE GREAT. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. I LOOKED AT A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. I AM TAKING BACK OF MY CAREER. WHEN I WAS SHOWN, A YOUNG MAN IN NEW YORK, WE HAD A PROBLEM CALLED A SKATING RINK. IT TOOK EIGHT YEARS. EVERYONE KNOWS. THEY NOW STUDY IT IN ALL THE BUSINESS SCHOOLS. WE ALL STUDIED IT. I DID NOT STUDY IT, I DIDN'T. IT IS IN ALL THE BUSINESS GOALS ABOUT WHAT PRIVATE ENTERPRISE CAN DO. WE HAD A RING. NOT A LITTLE DEAL. AND 80,000 FOOT RINK. A VERY BIG WORRY. -- RINK. THEY COULD NOT GET IT BUILT. IT WAS IN RENOVATION, IT WASN'T EVEN HOLDING. AFTER EIGHT YEARS, AND I HAD A DAUGHTER GROWING UP SAID, I WANT TO GO ICE SKATING. AND I WOULD SAY, A BANCA -- ANYONE EVER HEAR OF -- IVANKA, ANYONE EVER HEAR OF A BANCA? I WOULD SAY, THERE IS NO ICE. I WOULD SEE THE WORKERS, THEY WERE SITTING DOWN. LUNCH BREAKS, 4-5 HOURS. HUNDREDS OF GUYS SITTING DOWN IN THE RINK. AFTER THE SEVENTH YEAR, I WENT TO KOCH. AND I SAID, ED, I CAN DO THIS FAST. THIS IS NOT WORKING. THEY ARE USING THE WRONG EVERYTHING. I MET WITH THE UNIONS. I MET WITH PEOPLE WHO DID REFRIGERATION. THE ENGINEER WAS BASED IN MIAMI, FLORIDA. IT'S TRUE. A WERE USING FREON. FREON, THAT MEANS IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE TINY HOLE, IN 30 MILES OF PRIVATE, A LITTLE TINY HOLE, IT IS NOT GOING TO WORK. WHY DO WE WANT A GUY -- I CALLED UP THE MONTREAL CANADIENS ICE HOCKEY TEAM. I ASKED YOU DID THEIR RANKS. THEY SAID THEY HAD SOMEONE EXCELLENT BASED IN MONTREAL. I SAID, NOW WE ARE TALKING. HE CAME IN, LOOKED AT WHAT WAS HAPPENING, HE IMMEDIATELY SAID, YOU CANNOT USE FREON. IT WILL FREEZE. YOU USE BRINE. BRINE IS WATER WITH SALT IN IT. HOW SIMPLE COULD THAT GET? A TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE, WAS MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE. I GOT TO TOWN. AT KOCH SAID, COULD YOU DO IT? IT WAS A HUGE EMBARRASSMENT FOR NEW YORK PEOPLE. THEY KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. WE HAD CEMENT MIXERS, IT WAS A MASSIVE WAR. THEY WERE POURING LITTLE SECTIONS, 10 FEET HIGH 10 FEET. TAKE THE BIGGEST OFFICE FLOOR YOU KNOW AND DOUBLE OR TRIPLE IT. THEY WOULD TAKE A LITTLE SECTION, ANOTHER LITTLE SECTION. THE VANDALS WOULD COME IN AT NIGHT AND STILL THE COPPER. BEFORE JAN, YOU HAVE TO USE COPPER. I SAID, THIS IS NOT GOOD. YOU WANT ONE CONTIGUOUS POUR. I HAD TRACKS FROM THE RINK ALL THE WAY BACK TO HARLEM. WAY UP TO 125TH STREET. 24 HOURS, POURING DURING THE DAY, POURING DURING THE NIGHT. 26 HOURS AND 25 MINUTES. WE BOARD ONE CONTIGUOUS POUR. IT HEALED BEAUTIFULLY. IN THE CITY DID IT, THEY HAD ON ONE SIDE 1.5 FEET OF WATER, ON THE OTHER SIDE, NO WATER. THEY COULD NOT MAKE ICE FOR A LOT OF REASONS. WHEN I TALKED ABOUT THE PRICE, THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAD WAS DEMOLITION. THAT WAS THE BIGGEST COST. I HAD TO DEMOLISH EVERYTHING THAT WAS DONE. I GOT IT DONE. I GOT EVERYONE TOGETHER, WE GOT IT DONE. TO THIS DAY, IT IS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL I SKATING RINK. I STILL RUN IT. THE CITY DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE ANY CHANCES. I'VE RUN IT FOR MANY YEARS. IT IS THE NUMBER ONE ICE RINK IN THE WORLD WILL STOP I WAS TALKING TO JOHN -- THE NUMBER ONE ICE RINK IN THE WORLD. I WAS TALKING TO JOHN. THE BEAUTY OF IT IS, I DID IT IN FOUR MONTHS. I DID IT FOR $1.8 MILLION. THE CITY HAD SPENT OVER $3 MILLION. I ALWAYS SAY, MOST OF IT WAS DEMOLITION. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS. YOU CAN DO IT WITH THE COUNTRY. BELIEVE ME, YOU CAN DO THINGS PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA. OUR ROADS ARE FALLING APART. OUR BRIDGES. OUR TUNNELS. OUR AIRPORTS. I JUST LEFT LAGUARDIA AIRPORT. IT IS THIRD WORLD. IT IS HORRIBLE. YOU LOOK AT IT, YOU GO OUT TO THE RUNWAYS, IT IS WEARABLE. I GO TO PLACES BECAUSE I TRAVEL ALL OVER THE WORLD. I HAVE SO MANY RELATIONSHIPS, PARTNERSHIPS, COMPLICATED STUFF. I MEET THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. I AM PARTNERS WITH MANY OF THEM. YOU GO TO QATAR, YOU GO TO ALL THE DIFFERENT PLACES, ALL OVER CHINA. YOU GO TO BAHRAIN. SAUDI ARABIA. YOU SEE AIRPORTS, YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. THEY BUILD TEMPORARY AIRPORTS WHILE THEY ARE BUILDING THE BIG ONE THAT ARE 100 TIMES NICER THAN ANYTHING WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE LOST IT. ANOTHER DEAL THAT JUST HAPPENED, AND AGAIN GETTING EVERYBODY TOGETHER, THE BRONX, RIGHT OUTSIDE OF MANHATTAN, AND MOST OF YOU READ ABOUT IT, THEY HAD A 350 ACRE OF LAND ON THE WATER. ON THE EAST RIVER. THE EAST RIVER IS GREAT. PEOPLE HAVE APARTMENTS THERE, RIGHT? EXPAND BALL INTO 500 50 ACRES. FIVE MINUTES OUTSIDE OF MANHATTAN, RIGHT UP THE MANHATTAN RAMP. THEY HAD BEEN BUILDING THE GOLF COURSE FOR 30 YEARS. I THINK. SOMEBODY SAID, IT IS REALLY NOT 30, IT IS 21 YEARS. OK, 21. WHETHER IT IS 30, 21, OR 30. IT HAS BEEN UNDER CONSTRUCTION FOR MANY YEARS. WE BELIEVE THE COST IS OVER $300 MILLION. THE MAYOR SAID TO ME, WHAT DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD COST? I SAID, ABOUT 7 MILLION. I BELIEVE THE COST IS OVER 300 MILLION. MAYOR BLOOMBERG SAID, YOU HAVE TO HELP US. THEY WENT TO AN RFP. I HAVE A LONG-TERM DEAL. I TOOK IT OVER, GOT IT DONE IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR. FOURTH NUTS. IT IS BEAUTIFUL. RAVE REVIEWS. I HAD TO GET THE CITY TOGETHER, THE UNIONS TOGETHER, EVERYBODY TOGETHER. WE GOT IT DONE. NOW IT IS OPEN, SETTING EVERY RECORD BECAUSE OF ITS LOCATION. IT IS PHENOMENAL. NEXT TO MANHATTAN, ON THE RIVER. UNBELIEVABLE. YOU CAN DO THESE THINGS. IT IS ABOUT LEADERSHIP. YEP TO GET PEOPLE TOGETHER. IF I HAD SOMEBODY WORKING FOR ME THAT WAS GOOD, I COULDN'T HAVE. IT HAD TO BE ME. I NEEDED THE COUNCIL, THE MAYOR. AND IT HAS TO COME FROM THE PRESIDENT. I WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING THAT, TO ME, IS SO BIG. CORPORATE INVERSION. I LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE COMMON THINGS YOU WANT TO DO. CREATE 25 MILLION JOBS. THIS IS THE ORGANIZATION YOU WANT TO DO. ALAN'S THE FEDERAL BUDGET BY 230. 230? THAT IS AN EASY ONE. THEY GAVE ME THIS NOTE, I SAID, I THINK THERE IS A TYPO. 2030? SECURE SOCIAL SECURITY? WE HAVE TO DO IT. NEEDED. WE HAVE A CONTRACT. I HAVE A CONTRACT. I DO NOT NEED OF MINE, BY THE WAY. IF YOU DON'T NEED IT, GIVE IT UP. IT HAS TO BE THAT PERSON'S DECISION. I HAVE FRIENDS WHO MAKE HUNDREDS OF OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THE CHECK COMES IN. A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD GIVE IT UP FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY. I WANT TO DO THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY HAS EVEN TALKED ABOUT. I HAVE FRIENDS WHO SAY, I KNOW ONE OF. LET'S GIVE IT UP. A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD DO IT. YOU GIVE IT UP IN THE SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GIVE IT UP OR DEEP PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED IT. IT IS SO IMPORTANT.  AND MAKE AMERICA ENERGY SECURE BY 2024. IT IS ALMOST ENERGY-SECURE NOW. BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY, WHAT WE HAVE IN THE GROUND IS ENORMOUS. THAT WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO EXPORT IT. AND WE HAVE MORE THAN ANYBODY. I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE ORAL PEOPLE, GREAT PEOPLE. WE HAVE THE BEST STUFF. I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TAR SANDS. IT IS EXPENSIVE TO GET THE OIL. IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY. YOU DO HEATED, COLIN, DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS. -- TIY G -- YOU HAVE TO HEATED, COOL IT, DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS. WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE COAL ANYMORE, BUT WE EXPORT COAL TO CHINA AND WE SAVE CHINA HAS TO GO UNDER THE AGREEMENT. IT NOT FOR 25, 30 YEARS. HOW STUPID ARE WE? HOW STUPID DO THEY THINK WE ARE?  IT IS LIKE OUR MILITARY. I LOVE OUR VETS. I WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY THAT'S, BELIEVE -- OF OUR BETS, BELIEVE ME. OUR VETS ARE BEING TREATED WORSE THAN A ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY. THEY ARE BEING TREATED WORSE AND THEY ARE OUR WOUNDED WARRIORS, THEY ARE NOT BEING TREATED FAIRLY. I WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT. I WATCHED PRESIDENT OBAMA LAST NIGHT ON TELEVISION. HE BOMBED. VERY SIMPLY. IT WAS NOT EASY FOR HIM. STEVE CROFT, THEY WERE MUCH NICER TO ME. I WAS ON WITH PUTIN DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? YOU DIDN'T AND CHARM, NICE TABLE MATES. PUTIN AND TRUMP. EVERY SINGLE THING IS NEGATIVE. ISIS. SYRIA. A RACK. AFGHANISTAN. -- IRAQ. AFGHANISTAN. THE LABOR FORCE. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET JOBS. THE STATISTIC IS PHONY. IT DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING. OTHER THAN THE POLITICIANS IN THIS ROOM, THEY DO NOT COUNT BECAUSE THEY ARE FABULOUS. I HATE TO DO THAT TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE SITTING THERE WITH THEIR WIVES. BUT THIS STATISTIC WAS MADE UP BY POLITICIANS, BECAUSE IT LOOKS GOOD WILL STOP A MAN LOOKS FOR A JOB, HE CAN'T FIND ONE. OR A WOMAN. THEY GO HOME AND SAY, I HAVE LOOKED FOR MONTHS, I CANNOT FIND ONE. WE HAVE 100 MILLION PEOPLE. 100 MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF THE WORKFORCE. WE HIGHEST NUMBER IT HAS EVER BEEN. SOMEBODY SAID, A VERY TALENTED PERSON, SAID OUR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, AND I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS NUMBER, BUT THEY SAID OUR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS 42%. IF YOU REALLY ADDED UP, IT IS. THAT I ONLY ALWAYS SAY IT HAS EVER BEEN. SOMEBODY SAID, A VERY TALENTED PERSON, SAID OUR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, AND I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE 21%, 22 PERCENT. BECAUSE I WANT TO BE NICE TO THE PRESIDENT. THAT IT IS A DISASTER. WE HAVE TO BRING THE JOBS BACK HOME.  SO, WHAT HAPPENS, AND WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS WE WILL GET INTO A SITUATION WHERE HOPEFULLY WHEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS INTERVIEWED BY 60 MINUTES OR WHOEVER, THEY CAN SAY, WOW YOU HAVE REALLY MADE SOME UNBELIEVABLE STRIDES WITH TRADE DEALS. I HAVE THE SMARTEST, TOUGHEST NEGOTIATORS IN THE WORLD LINED UP. THEY DON'T WANT ANYTHING FOR IT. JUST LIKE I DON'T ONE A SALARY. SOMEONE SAID TO ME THE OTHER DAY, WOULD YOU WANT YOUR SALARY IF YOU BECAME PRESIDENT? I SAID, NO. I KNOW ONE OF. THESE GUYS DON'T WANT ANYTHING. I WANT TO HELP. THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING. I KNOW GUYS WHO ARE SO TOUGH AND SMART. THE OTHER DAY SOMEONE SAID, YOU WANT TOUGH. I SAID, I DON'T WANT TOUGH. I WANT TO AND SMART. I KNOW TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE TOUGH AND NOT SMART. WE NEED THE COMBINATION. SMART, TOUGH PEOPLE. WE HAVE GOT TO BRING OUR COUNTRY BACK. WE CANNOT GO ON LIKE THIS. WE CANNOT CONTINUED TO LOSE. THE U.S. TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA, ALMOST $400 BILLION A YEAR. LAST YEAR THE SAME. I WENT BACK FIVE YEARS, IT GETS WORSE. IF YOU WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH CHINA, YOU CANNOT. I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE MANUFACTURERS, THEY CANNOT GET THEIR PRODUCT IN. IF THEY DO, THEY HAVE TO PAY A HUGE TERROR. A MAN I AM VERY CLOSE TO -- BY THE WAY, I LOVE THE CHINESE. THAT THEIR LEADERS ARE TOO SMART. I LOVE MEXICO, BUT THEIR LEADERS ARE TOO SMART FOR OUR LEADERS. NABISCO IS MOVING INTO MEXICO. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? LEAVING CHICAGO. WHICH MEANS, I AM NEVER GOING TO READ ANOTHER OREO AGAIN. NEVER. FORD IS BUILDING A 2.5 MILLION DOLLAR PLANT IN MEXICO. HOW DOES THAT HELP US? THEY'RE CLOSING IN MEXICAN. -- IN MICHIGAN. I WENT TO THE WHARTON SCHOOL OF FINANCE. WHY IS THIS GOOD FOR US? WHY? IN TENNESSEE, THEY ARE ALL SET TO ANNOUNCE A BIG PLANT AND THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED VERY QUICKLY, VERY RUTHLESSLY, THEY HAVE DECIDED TO GO TO MEXICO IN STEAD. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP OUR JOBS IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES, THEY CHARGE YOU TAX WILL STOP WE DO NOT CHARGE THEM TAX. BECAUSE WE ARE STUPID. IT IS NOT FAIR. WE NEED PROBLEM SOLVERS. WE NEED LEADERS. YOU CANNOT HAVE LEADERSHIP UNLESS YOU KNOW HOW TO -- WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY RICH AGAIN. A WOMAN CAME UP TO ME, SHE SAID, I LIKE YOU SO MUCH, BUT ARE YOU A NICE ENOUGH PERSON TO BE PRESIDENT? I SAID, I THINK I AM NICE. I LOVE PEOPLE. I SAID, I AM NICE, BELIEVE ME. I AM GOING TO TAKE CARE OF WOMEN, I AM GOING TO TAKE CARE OF MEN, I AM GOING TO TAKE CARE OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS. IT IS A RECORD. AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH, LOOK AT THE INNER CITIES. AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH CANNOT GET JOBS AT ALL. 67% UNEMPLOYMENT. I AM GOING TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE, BUT I SAID TO HER, I REALLY DO NOT THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT IF I AM A NICE PERSON. I THINK PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH INCOMPETENT POLITICIANS THAT DO NOT GET THINGS DONE. I THINK THEY ARE FED UP.  AND I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ELECTION THAT IS LARGELY BASED ON COMPETENCE. WE WANT OUR COUNTRY BACK. WE WANT TO TAKE IT BACK. SO, IT IS REALLY AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU. IT IS IN INCREDIBLE GROUP. BEHIND ME IS THE FUTURE.  EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE OF PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE THAT I KNOW, FORGET THEM. LIKE, THIS IS THE FUTURE. I THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. SO, IT WOULD BE MY HONOR. GO AHEAD, SIR. YES? GO AHEAD. SURE. WAIT.  THOSE ARE GOOD THINGS. ALZHEIMER'S, AIDS. WE ARE CLOSE ON SOME OF THEM. ON SOME OF THEM, HONESTLY, WITH ALL OF THE WORK DONE WHICH IS NOT BEEN ENOUGH, WE'RE NOT CLOSE ENOUGH. THE ANSWER IS YES. I BELIEVE STRONGLY IN THAT AND WE ARE GOING TO LEAVE THE WAY. YES, SIR?  LET ME SAY, THE WORD COMPROMISE IS NOT A BAD WORD TO ME AS A NEGOTIATOR, HAVING MADE DEALS ALL MY LIFE. I AM COMING OUT WITH A BOOK IN THREE WEEKS. DOES ANYONE KNOW THE TITLE OF THE BOOK? ""CRIPPLED AMERICA."" IT'S A VERY SAD TITLE. SIMON & SCHUSTER SAID, WE WOULD LOVE TO DO A BOOK. I STARTED WRITING, AND I WORKED WITH A GROUP, THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE. I REALIZED HOW MUCH NEGATIVITY IS GOING ON. I SAID THAT. THEN THEY SENT A GREAT PHOTOGRAPHER AND TOOK THESE BEAUTIFUL PICTURES OF ME SMILING . SMILING. I LOOK NICE. MY WIFE SAID, YOU LOOK REALLY GOOD. BUT I DIDN'T USE THAT PICTURE. I USED THE WORST PICTURE. IT IS MEAN, ANGRY, BECAUSE I'M ANGRY ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY, AND I PUT IT RIGHT ON THE COVER AT THE BOOK. IT'S A HORRIBLE PICTURE. BUT I LIKE THE WORD ""COMPROMISE."" WE NEED COMPROMISE. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH COMPROMISE, BUT IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO COMPROMISE AND WIN, MEANING, LESS COMPROMISE AND WIN. AS FAR AS TAXES, I PUT OUT A PLAN WHERE I AM REDUCING PLAN -- TAXES SUBSTANTIALLY. WE ARE BRINGING CORPORATE DOWN TO 15%, BRINGING TREMENDOUS TAX REDUCTIONS TO VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY. WE ARE GETTING RID OF A LOT OF THE DEDUCTIONS, LIKE CARRIED INTEREST, WHICH IS MEANT FOR THE HEDGE FUND GUYS. WE ARE GETTING RID OF THEM. THE HEDGE FUND GUYS DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ME ANYMORE. THEY WANTED TO GIVE ME MILLIONS. I AM SELF FUNDING. THEY WANTED TO GIVE ME MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I DON'T WANT IT, BECAUSE IF I TAKE IT I HAVE TO BE LIKE JEB BUSH AND RUBIO AND ALL THESE GUYS AND I HAVE TO DO WHAT THEY TELL ME TO DO, BECAUSE BELIEVE ME, THEY ARE PUPPET. I AM SELF FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE ASKED FOR A MAJOR TASK -- TAX REDUCTION AND A MAJOR SIGNIFICATION. THE WORD COMPROMISE IS ABSOLUTELY FINE. BUT IF YOU HAVE TO COMPROMISE, ASK FOR ABOUT THREE TIMES MORE THAN YOU WANT, YOU UNDERSTAND? SO THAT WHEN YOU COMPROMISE, YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT. GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD. SHE DOESN'T HAVE A MIC. WHO HAS A MIC? OK. LOOK WHO WE HAVE. GOOD.  BY THE WAY, IT IS NOT $18 TRILLION, IT IS NOW $19 TRILLION. WE HAVE $19 TRILLION IN DEFICITS. WE OWE, THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, WE OWE $19 TRILLION AS A COUNTRY, AND WE WILL BRING IT DOWN QUICKLY. WE WILL BRING JOBS BACK, BRING BUSINESS BACK. WE WILL STOP OUR DEFICITS. WE WILL STOP OUR DEFICITS. WE WILL DO IT VERY QUICKLY.  NUMBER ONE, WE HAVE TREMENDOUS CUTTING TO DO. YOU HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THAT IS OUT OF CONTROL. MASSIVE COSTS. SOME OF THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE LIKE COMMON CORE. I AM AGAINST COMMON CORE. I WANT LOCAL EDUCATION. WHEN I MEAN NEW HAMPSHIRE -- WHEN I AM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA AND SOUTH CAROLINA, IT IS SO IMPORTANT. WE WILL SAVE OUR DEPARTMENT OUT ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THEY ARE NOT DOING THEIR JOB. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR COUNTRY TO COMPETE. AND MANY OTHER THINGS. HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IS GOING TO BE SAVED JUST IN TERMS OF RUNNING GOVERNMENT. IN ADDITION, I WILL BRING MILLIONS OF JOBS BACK INTO THIS COUNTRY. OK, QUESTIONS.  HERE'S THE THING. I WENT TO IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS. I KNOW WHAT IS DIVISIVE AND NOT DIVISIVE, IN ALL FAIRNESS. I DON'T WANT TO NECESSARILY BE POLITICALLY CORRECT ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LINE. BECAUSE I SEE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T EVEN FUNCTION. I SEE POLITICIANS WHO ARE AFRAID TO SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE IT'S NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT, AND THEY KNOW THE ANSWERS AND REFUSE TO GIVE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID IT'S NOT GOING TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT, AND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BE WHO I AM. AT THE SAME TIME, I AM RUNNING AGAINST A LOT OF PEOPLE. IT WAS 16 NOW 15. MANY ARE GOING TO BE DROPPING OUT SOON, IF THEY ARE SMART. TOO MANY PEOPLE. TOO MANY PEOPLE. WHEN IT BECOMES A DIFFERENT KIND OF A SITUATION, YOU WILL SEE I WILL BE MUCH LESS DIVISIVE, BUT ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS -- I NEVER START ANYTHING. THEY START. THEY GET VERY NASTY, WHETHER IT IS LINDSEY GRAHAM, PERRY FROM TEXAS. I GET ALONG GREAT, AND THEN BECAUSE THEY ARE DYING, DOING SO BADLY, THEY FIGURE, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM WANTS TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT GOING TO FIGHT. THE PROBLEM IS AS WE HAVE PEOPLE NOW WHO DON'T. THEY DON'T. AND THE COUNTRY, THE COUNTRY IS BEING HURT TREMENDOUSLY BY IT. ANOTHER QUESTION.  WHERE ARE YOU?  SO IMPORTANT. THE ONE THING I GET MORE THAN ANY OTHER QUESTION IS STUDENT LOANS. THEY GO OUT AND GET AN EDUCATION FROM GREAT COLLEGES. MANY GREAT COLLEGES. THEY BECOME THE BEST STUDENT IN THE CLASS, EVERYTHING IS GREAT, THEN THEY CAN'T GET A JOB. THE BEST WAY TO SOLVE IT IS TO CREATE JOBS, BUT THEY CAN'T GET JOBS. THE STUDENTS ARE GOING OUT AND BORROWING MONEY ALL OVER THE PLACE, BORROWING STUDENT LOAN MONEY, ONE OF THE ONLY AGENCIES IN GOVERNMENT THAT MAKES A LOT OF MONEY, THE ONE PLACE WHERE MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE MAKING SO MUCH MONEY. IT'S A QUESTION I GET MORE THAN ANY OTHER QUESTION. WE ARE GOING TO BE CUTTING THAT DOWN, GIVING PEOPLE INCENTIVE TO GO AND GET AN EDUCATION. AT A MUCH LOWER PRICE. DON'T FORGET, THESE SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY GET SO MUCH MONEY FROM THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH STUDENTS, THEY ARE RAISING FEES TO A POINT THAT IS RIDICULOUS. THEY DON'T NEED TO GET THAT KIND OF MONEY. THEY DON'T NEED TO GET THAT KIND OF MONEY. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS GIVING OUT SO MUCH MONEY, YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE COST OF EDUCATION, AND IT HAS NOT GONE UP THAT MUCH. WE WILL GET THOSE NUMBERS DOWN, AND ALSO WE WILL HAVE JOBS SO THAT WHEN YOU GRADUATE YOU WILL END UP WITH A NICE JOB WHERE YOU ARE VERY HAPPY. THANK YOU. GREAT QUESTION.  GO AHEAD.  I LOVE THE TEA PARTY.  I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THE TEA PARTY. THESE ARE PEOPLE, IN ALL FAIRNESS, THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT LOVE THIS COUNTRY. THEY DO LOVE THIS COUNTRY, AND THEY WANT THIS COUNTRY TO BE GREAT. GO AHEAD.  THEY DON'T WANT PLANNED PARENTHOOD FUNDED. A LOT OF PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT, INCLUDING ME. I UNDERSTAND THAT. SO YOU DO HAVE THAT. SO YOU DO HAVE THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THAT WAY.  I KNOW I SHOULD NOT HAVE PICKED HER. LET ME GIVE YOU THAT ANSWER RIGHT NOW. I RESPECT WOMEN INCREDIBLY. I HAVE HAD WOMEN WORKING FOR ME IN POSITIONS THAT THEY NEVER WORKED, IN TERMS OF SO MANY DIFFERENT JOBS. I HAD A WOMAN WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE BUILDING OF TRUMP TOWER MANY YEARS AGO, BEFORE ANYBODY WOULD HAVE EVEN THOUGHT OF IT. AND SHE DID A FANTASTIC JOB. I HAVE GIVEN WOMEN MORE OPPORTUNITY THAN I WOULD SAY VIRTUALLY ANYBODY IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. I HAVE A DAUGHTER NAMED IVANKA AND A WIFE, WHO CONSTANTLY WANT ME TO TALK ABOUT WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES, BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT. THEY KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT WOMEN. I RESPECT WOMEN. I LOVE WOMEN. I CHERISH WOMEN. HILLARY CLINTON SAID, HE SHOULD NOT CHERISH. I CHERISH WOMEN. MY MOTHER WAS ONE OF THE GREAT PEOPLE OF THE WORLD, MY MOTHER. I RESPECT WOMEN, AND I'M GOING TO TAKE CARE OF WOMEN. JEB BUSH DID NOT WANT TO FUND WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES. YOU SAW THAT. THEN HE TOOK IT BACK LATER. I WILL TAKE CARE OF WOMEN, AND I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR WOMEN, AND I DO CHERISH WOMEN, AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF WOMEN. I WILL TAKE CARE OF US, ALSO, FROM THE ENEMY, THE ENEMY ON DIFFERENT SHORES LOOKING TO COME IN AND DO NUMBERS. BELIEVE ME, I WILL TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY FAR BETTER THAN ANY OF THE FOLKS YOU ARE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW. THAT I CAN TELL YOU. GO AHEAD.  YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THE SAME IF YOU DO AS GOOD A JOB. YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THE SAME IF YOU DO AS GOOD A JOB, AND I HAPPEN TO BE PRO-LIFE, OK? I AM PRO-LIFE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? YES, GO AHEAD, YOU HAVE THE MIC BACK THERE. GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD. SHOUT IT OUT. SHOOT. HE'S CHOKING. COME ON.  ARE YOU FROM SOUTH KOREA?  WHICH IS PEANUTS. EXCUSE ME, IT IS PEANUTS COMPARED TO WHAT IT IS COSTING. BY THE WAY, THEY ARE A VERY WEALTHY COUNTRY. PART OF THE PROBLEM WHEN WE TALK ABOUT, LIKE YOUR QUESTION, ABOUT DEFICITS AND LOSING, WE ARE DEFENDING GERMANY, WE ARE DEFENDING JAPAN, WE ARE DEFENDING SOUTH KOREA, WE ARE DEFENDING SO MANY COUNTRIES. WE GET PEANUTS. WE GET NOTHING. WE GET A SMALL PAYMENT. IT IS A TINY FRACTION, AND I TALK, I SAY ALL THE TIME ABOUT SOUTH KOREA, I ORDERED 4000 TELEVISION SETS RECENTLY FOR A BIG PROJECT. THEY ALL COME FROM SOUTH KOREA. MY ONLY BID FROM SOUTH KOREA, WHETHER IT IS LG, SAMSUNG, THESE ARE WEALTHY COUNTRIES. WE HAVE 28,000 SOLDIERS ON THE BORDER OF SOUTH KOREA. SO WE DEFEND GERMANY, WHICH IS SENDING CARS AND EVERYTHING, AND ECONOMIC BEHEMOTH. WE ARE DEFENDING JAPAN. SO HERE'S THE DEAL WE MAKE. WE DEFEND JAPAN AND WE HAVE TO DEFEND THEM WITH OUR LIVES. IF ANYBODY ATTACKS JAPAN, WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT, WE HAVE TO GO AND ATTACK AND FIGHT AND DIE AND TO SPEND. BUT IF ANYBODY ATTACKS US, JAPAN DOESN'T HAVE TO DO A THING. THAT'S THE WAY WE RUN THINGS. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITH ME, FOLKS. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITH ME. IF WE ARE DEFENDING PEOPLE WHO ARE FAR RICHER THAN US, THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. WE WANT TO HELP THEM, BUT WHY ARE WE DEFENDING GERMANY? WHY ARE WE DEFENDING SOUTH KOREA? WHY ARE WE DEFENDING JAPAN, AND THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING FOR US? WE WILL HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS, BUT WHY DO WE PAY THE COST OF DEFENDING THE WORLD? WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MILITARY BUDGET, IT IS FAR HIGHER THAN ANYBODY ELSE'S, BUT YOU KNOW WHY IT IS HIGHER? BECAUSE WE ARE DEFENDING ALL THESE COUNTRIES. NOT HELPING US. SO WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THINGS AROUND AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. BELIEVE ME. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.

YOU KNOW WHEN I HAVE A PLACE -- USUALLY I HAVE A LOT OF THEM. WHEN I GO TO CERTAIN AREAS, I LIKE TO BRING THE EMPLOYEES. WE HAVE SOME OF OUR EMPLOYEES HERE TODAY FROM THE VINEYARDS. I LIKE TO BRING THE EMPLOYEES UP BECAUSE IT IS SO IMPORTANT. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE COUNTRY WHERE OUR JOBS ARE BEING TAKEN AWAY. THEY ARE GOING TO OTHER PLACES, AS YOU KNOW, LIKE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES. I MEAN YOU CAN NAME THE COUNTRY. WE DON'T MAKE GOOD DEALS ANYMORE. WE JUST DON'T.

WHAT CANDIDATE CAN BEST HANDLE THE ECONOMY? OKAY.   WELL, THAT ONE IS BIG. 67% SAID TRUMP. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? NOW YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER.

LOOK AT ALL OF THE RED LIGHTS. SHOW THE CROWD, EVERYBODY. SHOW THE CROWD. YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE FIRE MARSHAL WOULD NOT LET IT IN. IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS. I WILL TELL YOU WHEN YOU HAVE 67% IN A TWO-PERSON RACE, THAT'S CALLED LANDSLIDE. THAT'S CALLED MASSIVE VICTORY. I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER BEEN A VICTORY. HERE WE HAVE ON A THING CALLED THE ECONOMY. WOULD YOU SAY THAT'S IMPORTANT? I THINK SO; RIGHT? SO 67% ARE INFAVOR FOR TRUMP. OKAY. WE WON THE STATE BY A LOT. MEANING IN THE POLLS BY A LOT. A COUPLE OF THE CATEGORIES, I HAVE TO READ THEM.

THAT'S ALL RIGHT. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE FREEDOM OF SPEECH, FOLKS. YOU KNOW?   I'LL TELL YOU HOWDIES HONEST THE PRESS IS. WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, I THINK 7,200 PEOPLE. WE HAVE ABOUT 10 PEOPLE OVER THERE. THEY WILL GET THE HEADLINE. YOU WON'T. THAT'S PRETTY DISGUSTING. PRETTY DISGUSTING. BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, 55% WANT TRUMP. 13% IS SECOND PLACE. THAT TELLS YOU SOMETHING RIGHT THERE. 13%. 13%. ON SOCIAL ISSUES, TRUMP IS FIRST. ON FOREIGN POLICY, --     THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT IS TRUE. I SEE A COUPLE OF CAMERAS FOR ABOUT FOUR PEOPLE. THEY ARE GOING WILD. THE CAMERAS. IT IS SO DISGUSTING. BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

WE'VE ALL COME A LONG WAY TOGETHER. WE'VE ALL COME. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A LOT OF BAD PEOPLE OUT THERE. THEY WANT TO STOP PROGRESS. YOU SEE IT ALL THE TIME. I USE THE STATEMENT THE SILENT MAJORITY. THE SILENT MAJORITY IS BACK, FOLKS. THE SILENT MAJORITY IS BACK. THE SILENT MAJORITY IS BACK. SO OVER THE LAST PERIOD OF TIME, WE HAVE HAD A VERY INTERESTING THING HAPPEN. WE'VE SEEN OUR COUNTRY WHERE WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE. WE'RE GOING TO START WINNING SO MUCH WE'RE GOING TO WIN LEFT, WE'RE GOING TO WIN RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO WIN EVERYTHING. WE HAVE UNBELIEVABLE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. NOTHING IS GOING TO STOP US FROM STARTING TO WIN AGAIN. YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES. YOU LOOK AT HOW THEY ARE TAKING OUR JOBS, HOW THEY ARE TAKING OUR BASE, HOW THEY ARE TAKING EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE INCLUDING OUR MANY. YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE FOREIGN NO MATTER WHAT COUNTRY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, THEY BEAT THE UNITED STATES. IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE. IT IS.   OUR TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA IS ALMOST $400 BILLION. $400 BILLION A YEAR. A YEAR. AND THEN I SEE OUR PRESIDENT ENTERTAINING THE HEADS OF CHINA AND TALKING ABOUT OUR GREAT TRADING PARTNERS. YEAH. THEY ARE A GREAT TRADING PARTNER FOR CHINA. NOT FOR US. OUR DEFICIT WITH JAPAN IS $70 BILLION A YEAR. THE CARS POUR IN. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE SELL THEM PRACTICALLY NOTHING RELATIVELY SPEAKING. WHAT WE SELL THEM IS BEEF. BEEF. THEY SELL US CARS. YOU GO OUT TO LOS ANGELES. YOU SEE THESE SHIPS. THE BIGGEST SHIPS YOU'VE EVER SEEN. THE CARS ARE POURING OFF. THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR US. OUR TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA IS ALMOST $70 MILLION. THINK OF THIS -- THINK OF THIS. JAPAN $70 MILLION. WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. NOW WE GO TO MEXICO. I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF MEXICO. I LOVE MEXICO. THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE. I HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF HISPANICS WORKING FOR ME. THOUSANDS. THOUSANDS OF HISPANICS. AND, IN FACT, IN NEVADA AT THE SAME POLL, I WIN WITH THE HISPANICS, WHICH EVERYONE IS SURPRISED. I WIN WITH THE HISPANICS. SO OUR TRADING DEFICIT WITH MEXICO IS $45 BILLION A YEAR. $45 BILLION. FLOW -- NOW I'M GOING TO BUILD A WALL THAT IS GOING TO BE REALLY A WALL. IT IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING SPECIAL. NOBODY IS COMING IN OTHER THAN IF YOU COME IN LEGALLY. EVERYBODY SAYS YOU CAN'T BUILD A WALL. I SAY MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT. THEY SAY YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. HOW CAN THEY DO THAT? IF THE WALL COSTS $6 BILLION TO BUILD AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT $S -- 1,000 MILES. IT IS 2,000, BUT YOU NEED IT ON 1,000. THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA IS 13,000 MILES AND WAS BUILT 2,000 YEARS AGO. WE HAVE A WALL THAT HAS TO BE BUILT. WE HAVE PROBLEMS COMING IN LIKE NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. IT HAS TO BE BUILT. HAS TO BE BUILT. WHATEVER ANYBODY SAID JUST REMEMBER THIS, ALMOST EVERYBODY WANTED THIS WALL BUILT TEN YEARS AGO, 12 YEARS AGO, 15 YEARS AGO, THE LIBERALS, THE CONSERVATIVES, EVERYBODY WANTED IT. ONE OF THE REASONS IT WASN'T BUILT IS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD THE WALL. MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT. NOW THE PEOPLE, THE STUDENT PEOPLE THEY MEXICO WILL PAY FOR IT. WE GIVE MEXICO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE HAVE THE TRADING DEFICIT OF ALMOST $50 MILLION. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FIVE, TO SIX, TO SEVEN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FROM FIVE TO $7 BILLION. WHO COULDN'T GET THAT MONEY? THEY ARE GOING TO PAY IT SO GLADLY. THEY ARE GOING TO PAY IT SO GLADLY. I WILL SAY THIS, I SPEAK TO OUR POLITICS ALL THE TIME. I SPEAK TO THEM LOUD AND CLEAR. A LOT OF THEM ARE NICE PEOPLE. THEY SAY, DONALD, YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET THEM TO PAY. I REALIZE THEY ARE NOT THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO DO THE JOB. WITH THE RIGHT MESSENGER, THEY WILL PAY SO HAPPILY AND GLADLY. THEY ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF US AT THE BORDER AND WITH TRADE. THEY ARE VERY GOOD PEOPLE. THEIR LEADERS ARE STARTER THAN OUR LAUDERS. OUR LEADERS DON'T HAVE A CLUE. THEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE. WE HAVE A SITUATION A MOTHER IS PREGNANT. SHE GOES TO THE BORDER. SHE TALKS ACROSS THE BORDER IN FRONT OF OUR BORDER PATROL. THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE. THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOB. SHE LIES DOWN THEY HAVE A BABY THEY CALL ANCHOR BABY. SHE HAS A BABY. NOW WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BABY FOR 85 YEARS. OKAY? I DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T THINK SO. WE CAN'T DO IT. WE OWE $19 TRILLION. WE OWE A NUMBER THAT'S ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. SO WE OWE $19 TRILLION. WE CAN'T BE IN A POSITION WHERE WE'RE DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING ANYMORE. WE JUST CAN'T. WE HAVE TO REBUILD OUR COUNTRY, WE HAVE TO REBUILD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE --    WE HAVE TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE. HAVE TO DO IT. HAVE TO DO IT. HAVE TO DO IT. OBAMACARE IS GOING TO COST US MORE MONEY THAN ANYBODY WOULD HAVE EVER DREAMT. IT IS NO GOOD. IT DOESN'T WORK. YOUR PREMIUMS ARE GOING UP 55%, 45%, 60%. YOUR DEDUCTIBLES ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. YOU WOULD BE DEAD AND NEVER GET ANY OF THE MONEY. YOUR DEDUCTIBLES ARE SO HIGH. WE'RE GOING TO REPEAL OBAMACARE AND REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE TERRIFIC. IT IS GOING TO BE TERRIFIC. IT IS GOING TO COST OUR COUNTRY VERY LITTLE. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR DOCTOR, HAVE THEIR PLAN, AND PAY LESS MONEY. IF THEY ARE SICK, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT A DEDUCTIBLE BEING SO HIGH NOTHING GETS IT UNLESS YOU GET HIT BE A TRACTOR. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SO GREAT AGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT SO GREAT. OUR TAXES, WE JUST PUT IN A PLAN THE OTHER DAY. WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE TAXES TREMENDOUSLY. BECAUSE WE HAVE THE HIGHEST TAX RATE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. OUR MIDDLE CLASS IS BEING ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED. IT IS BEING DESTROYED. YOU KNOW, WE USED TO HAVE THE MIDDLE CLASS THAT EVERYBODY WAS PROUD OF. WE DON'T HAVE THAT ANYMORE. THEY ARE BEING SO BADLY TREATED. OUR VETS ARE BEING TREATED WORSE THAN ANYBODY. OUR VETS. I WATCHED LAST NIGHT WITH BERNIE SANDERS AND HILLARY AND THE OTHER THREE GUYS THAT NOBODY -- YEAH -- YEAH. THE OTHER THREE GUYS THAT NOBODY EVEN KNOWS WHO THE HELL THEY ARE. WHO ARE THEY? I WATCHED LAST NIGHT AS HILLARY AND BERNIE SANDERS COULDN'T GIVE THINGS AWAY FAST ENOUGH. THEY WANT HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT, THEY WANT DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, THEY ARE SUGGESTING -- LISTEN TO THIS. THEY ARE SUGGESTING SOCIAL SECURITY FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. SO WE'RE GOING TO STRAIGHTEN THINGS OUT. WE'RE GOING TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. WE'RE GOING TO BRING IMMIGRATION UNDER CONTROL. WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A SITUATION LIKE KATE. BEAUTIFUL KATE IN SAN FRANCISCO. THIS GUY COMES IN FIVE DIFFERENT TIMES. IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE THAN THAT. AFTER THE FIFTH TIME, SHE GET SHOT IN THE BACK. WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE IT ANYMORE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SITUATION THAT'S GOING TO BE RATIONAL, REASONABLE, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IN THE COUNTRY WHEN SOMEBODY GOES THROUGH A LONG PROCESS WITH COLLEGE. THEY GO TO HARVARD, YALE, A GREAT COLLEGE, THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, GREAT COLLEGE -- THAT IS GREAT AND RIGHT NEXT TO OUR PROPERTY. WE LOVE THEM. THAT'S A GREAT COLLEGE. THEY GO TO THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. THEY DO FANTASTIC. THEY DO JUST GREAT. THEY ARE SO PROUD. THEY ARE FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY. THEY WANT TO STAY HERE. WE TELL THEM GET OUT. YOU STAYED HERE. YOU HAVE TO GO HOME. THEN THE CASE IN INDIA WHERE A MAN OPENED A COMPANY AND WANTED TO STAY HERE. HE ENDS UP OPENING IT IN INDIA. HE HAS 5,000 EMPLOYEES. IT IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST IN THE WORLD. HE WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. WE WANT TO KEEP PEOPLE HERE. WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME IN LEGALLY. I SAY AND SO IMPORTANTLY, AND I'M SAYING IT ALL THE TIME, WE WANT TO HAVE A BIG DOOR. WE WANT TO HAVE A BIG BEAUTIFUL DOOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WALL. WE WANT THOSE PEOPLE TO COME IN. THEY'VE GOT TO DO IT THROUGH A LEGAL PROCESS. IF WE DON'T HAVE A BORDER, IF WE DON'T HAVE A BORDER AND WE HAVE PEOPLE ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY ARE COMING FROM, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY. WE KNOW LONGER HAVE A COUNTRY. IT IS VERY SIMPLE. AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT WITH HEART. WE'RE GOING TO GET ALONG WITH PEOPLE. EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE GREAT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY AGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY. WE'RE GOING TO START DOING THINGS PROPERLY. WHEN WE HAVE COUNTRIES LIKE THE ONES I NAMED AND MANY OTHERS AND WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR LEADERS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT SMART, THEY ARE INCOMPETENT, THEY ARE STUPID, OR THEY DON'T CARE, THAT'S GOING TO END. I HAVE THE GREATEST MINDS IN WALL STREET. I HAVE THEM ALREADY LINED UP. THEY ARE CALLING ME. THESE ARE THE GREATEST NEGOTIATORS IN THE WORLD. THEY ARE CALLING ME. CARL ICON. GREAT. I HAVE ALL OF THEM. THEY DON'T WANT MONEY OR SALARY. THEY ARE RICH. THEY MADE IT BECAUSE THEY ARE GREAT NEGOTIATORS. THEY WANT TO COME AND SEE OUR COUNTRY BE GREAT AGAIN. THEY ARE PROUD OF OUR COUNTRY. SOME ARE NICE PEOPLE. SOME AREN'T. I DON'T CARE. I WANT THE GREATEST. I KNOW THE BEST, THE SMARTEST, THE SHARPEST. I KNOW PEOPLE THAT ARE OVER RATED. I KNOW PEOPLE THAT ARE BETTER THAN ALL OF THEM. AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING THEM IN AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING THEM IN AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF ONE, CHINA. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT CHINA. FIRST OF ALL, I LOVE CHINA. THE PEOPLE ARE GREAT. THEY BUY MY APARTMENTS FOR $50 MILLION ALL THE TIME. HOW COULD I DISLIKE IT? I TELL IT TO EVERYBODY. I HAVE THE LARGEST BANK IN THE WORLD IN ONE OF MY BUILDINGS. IT IS FROM CHINA. I LOVE CHINA. THEY HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE. I WISH IT WERE TURNED AROUND. I WISH OUR REPRESENTATIVES TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEM. I THINK THAT WOULD BE GREAT. I THINK THAT WOULD BE GREAT. BUT IT IS A ONE-WAY STREET. IT IS A ONE-WAY STREET TO POVERTY FOR US. POVERTY. WE CAN'T DO IT. WE'RE IN A BUBBLE RIGHT NOW. BELIEF ME WE'RE IN A BUBBLE. WE HAVE A PHONY STATISTIC ON JOBS, WE HAVE A HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORK FORCE THAT WANT TO WORK. WE HAVE A HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE. WE HAVE TREMENDOUS LEVELS OF POVERTY. WE HAVE WELFARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. THESE ARE PEOPLE IN MANY CASES THEY WANT TO GO OUT AND GET A GREAT JOB AND BE PROUD AND TAKE HOME A LOT OF MONEY. WE CAN'T BECAUSE WE'RE LOSING ALL OF OUR JOBS. WE'RE LOSING THEM TO OTHER NATIONS. WE'RE LOSING THEM TO STUPID POLICIES. THE TRADE PACK, TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. IT IS -- BELIEVE ME -- BELIEVE ME ME -- IF IT WAS GOOD, I WOULD SAY I DON'T CARE IF OBAMA PROPOSED IT. I WISH OBAMA WERE A GREAT PRESIDENT. I DON'T CARE. I WOULDN'T HAVE TO RUN. I LOVE WHAT I WAS DOING. IT'S TRUE. I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. SO TRUE. I WOULD LOVE IF HE WERE A GREAT PRESIDENT. WOW. HE IS A GREAT PRESIDENT. I WOULD VOTE AND BE HIS GREATEST FAN. I DON'T CARE. WHAT I WANT IS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY. I DON'T WANT TO BE DOING THIS. I'M ACTUALLY HAVING FUN BECAUSE I'M SO ENERGIZED. I GO TO THE CROWDS. WE HAVE 20,000 PEOPLE WITH A MAVERICKS PLAY. 20,000 PEOPLE. WE GO TO OKLAHOMA, WE HAD 20,000 PEOPLE IN A PARK. WE GO -- NO MATTER WHERE WE GO, WE WENT TO MOBILE, ALABAMA. WE HAD 35,000 PEOPLE. NO MATTER WHERE WE GO, WE GO UP TO NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE HAVE THE BIGGEST CROWD. IOWA, THE BIGGEST CROWD. SOUTH CAROLINA WE HAD SOMETHING TWO WEEKS AGO. IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. A FRIEND OF MINE SAID HOW DO YOU DO THAT? HOW DO YOU MAKE SPEECHES IN FRONT OF SO MANY PEOPLE. YOU DON'T HAVE TELL PROMPTERS. I DON'T WANT A TelePrompTer. I DON'T. IT WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER. IT WOULD BE -- THINK OF IT. YOU HAVE YOUR TelePrompTer; RIGHT? YOU WALK ON IT. HELLO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE IN VERMONT WHERE YOU HAVE ALL SORTS OF GREAT PEOPLE. AND YOU DO. BY THE WAY, WHEN YOU TALK, YOU REALLY HAVE THE HALL OF FAME. IT IS TRUE. YOU HAVE THE HALL OF FAME. I TOLD MY GUYS, I SAID LOOK, I'M HERE. I EMPLOY A LOT OF PEOPLE. JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS, THIS IS A REAL HALL OF FAME. PATRICK HENRY GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH. HOW GOOD? HOW GOOD IS THAT? I WANT TO COME UP WITH A SLOGAN AS GOOD AS THAT. HOW ABOUT MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN? THAT'S GREAT. IT IS GREAT. I STILL LIKE GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH. THAT'S VERY GOOD. I WANT TO GET THE WORD AGAIN OFF OF THAT EVENTUALLY. I WANT TO GET THE WORD HE SAID YOU WILL. I WILL. IT IS NOT EVEN GOING TO BE THAT HARD. IT IS NOT -- IT IS A COMMON SENSE. IT TAKES BUSINESS ABILITY. WE'RE GOING TO TREAT PEOPLE WELL. I SAY I'M A CONSERVATIVE WITH HEART. BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT GREAT HEALTH CARE PROGRAM. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYONE. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PAY LESS AND GET IT SO GOOD. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF MANY THINGS. I LIKE TO SAY CONSERVATIVE WITH HEART. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IF YOU ARE REPUBLICAN, YOU DON'T HAVE HEART. YOU ARE MEAN AND HORRIBLE PEOPLE. IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. I'VE GONE OVER MY PLANS. SOMEBODY SAID THAT'S NOT CON SEVENTIVE. IT IS INTERESTING. YOU HAVE A GROUP CALLED CLUB FOR GROWTH. I TALK ABOUT IT. I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THEM. THE GUY COMES UP TO MY OFFICE, RITE, AND HE SITS DOWN. NICE GUY. I THINK HE WAS AN EX-CONGRESSMAN. HE KNOWS HOW TO TALK. THEY ARE ALL TALK. EXCEPT FOR THE POLITICIANS IN THE ROOM. THEY ARE GREAT. IN FACT, DAVE BRANDT. HE'S GREAT. I WAS WITH HIS FAMILY AND CHILDREN AND WIFE. THERE'S A GUY. HE KNOWS YOU CAN DO THINGS. THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE WHAT HE DID. I JUST GAVE HIM A LOT OF CREDIT. I HAVE TO GO. OKAY. PATRICK HENRY WE TALKED. GREAT; RIGHT? THEN YOU HAVE THOMAS JEFFERSON. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD; RIGHT? THOMAS JEFFERSON. MAN. THEN YOU HAVE JAMES MADISON, PRINCIPLE AUTHOR OF THE CONSTITUTION. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. THEN YOU HAVE GEORGE WASHINGTON. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD; RIGHT? GEORGE WASHINGTON. YOU KNOW. PRETTY AMAZING. YOU KNOW. WHEN YOU THINK OF VIRGINIA, IT IS JUST PRETTY AMAZING. SO I TELL THE STORIES AND I LOVE THESE STORIES. BECAUSE IT SHOWS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. I'M SELF-FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN. OKAY? I'M THE ONLY ONE. I SEE ALL OF THE GUYS THAT ARE COMPETING WITH ME. SOME OF THEM ARE NICE. SOME OF THEM HAVE HIT ME REALLY HARD. THEY ARE ASKING ME FOR CONTRIBUTIONS. THEN AS SOON AS I RUN, IT IS LIKE A COUPLE OF THEM. PERRY WENT WILD. HE WAS A NICE GUY. DIDN'T WORK OUT TOO WELL FOR HIM. HE HIT ME. I THOUGHT HE WAS A NICE GUY. HE HIT ME. HE MADE SPEECHES ABOUT TRUMP. THEY WANT TO GET THEIR NUMBERS UP. NOT WORKING. EVERY CASE IT HAS GONE DOWN. THEY HAVE ALL GONE DOWN. EVERYBODY THAT PLAYS TOUGH WITH US, THEY ARE ALL GOING DOWN; RIGHT? THAT'S NICE. RIGHT? BUT I LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON AND I SEE SO MUCH. I SEE THE WAY THE POLITICIANS ARE CONTROLLING. DON'T FORGET I WAS THE PERFECT PERSON. I WAS, LIKE, CENTRAL CASTING. BEFORE I RAN, I WAS ON THE A LIST. I CONTRIBUTED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT. I GOT ALONG WELL WITH DEMOCRAT AND LIBERTIES AND CONSERVATIVES. THAT'S MY JOB. SOMEBODY SAID YOU GAVE MONEY TO A DEMOCRAT. OF COURSE I DID. I GET ALONG WITH EVERYBODY. ONE OF THE MAGAZINES SAID HE'S A WORLD CLASS BUSINESSMAN. YOU CAN'T HAVE FIGHTS. I WAS TOLD BY HILLARY IN A SPEECH RECENTLY AND SAME DAY BY JEB WE DON'T LIKE HIS TONE. I BUILT THIS INCREDIBLE COMPANY. YOU'LL SEE. THE BOOK COME OUT ON NOVEMBER 3RD. WHICH IS YOUR ELECTION DAY. GO OUT AND VOTE. IT ACTUALLY COMES OUT ON ELECTION DAY. IT IS GOING TO BE GREAT. ACTUALLY A TOUGH NAME ""CRIPPLED AMERICA."" IT TELLS YOU HOW TO FIX IT. I'M SELF-FUNDING. I WAS IN IOWA A FEW WEEKS AGO. I SAID TO THE PEOPLE I FEEL SO FOOLISH. THESE PEOPLE WANT TO GIVE ME MILLIONS AND MILLION OF DOLLARS. IT IS SORT OF LIKE ANTI-ME. WHY WOULDN'T I TAKE IT. I ALWAYS TAKE MONEY. IT IS WHAT I DO. I TAKE MONEY. THAT'S HOW YOU BECOME RICH; RIGHT? NO. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SO I SAID TO THE GROUP IN IOWA, WE HAD 5,000 PEOPLE IN AN AUDITORIUM LIKE THIS. I SAID HERE'S THE STORY. I FEEL A LITTLE BIT STUPID WHEN I DON'T TAKE ALL OF THIS MONEY. SUPPOSING I TAKE IT, JUST SUPPOSING AND I PROMISE I WON'T DO ANYTHING FOR THEM, AND THEY ALL STOOD UP AND SAID, NO, NO. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I THOUGHT I HAD TALKED THEM INTO IT. THE TRUTH IS I LOVE WHAT I'M DOING. I LOVE THAT I'M SELF-FUNDING. I'M NOT CONTROLLED BY ANYBODY. I'M NOT CONTROLLED. CONTROLLED BY YOU. REALLY I'M CONTROLLED BY YOU. I'M GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. YOU'VE HEARD ME TALKING ABOUT THE FORD PLAN. HAVE YOU HEARD THAT STORY? THE FORD PLAN. I LOVE IT. FORD, DO YOU WANT IT AGAIN? SHOULD I DO IT AGAIN? I JUST THINK IT IS GOOD. SO FORD CLOSES A LOT OF PLANTS. THEY ARE BUILDING A $2.5 BILLION PLANT IN MEXICO. WHAT DO WE GET OUT OF IT? THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE CARS AND TRUCKS AND PARTS. THEY ARE GOING TO SEND THEM INTO THE U.S. AND OTHER PLACES. HOW DOES THAT HELP US? WE ALL GO TO -- I WENT TO WHARTON. YOU ALL WENT TO GOOD SCHOOLS. IF YOU NEVER GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL, YOU KNOW IT IS NOT GOOD FOR US. A $2.5 BILLION PLANT IN MEXICO, THAT'S A BIG PLANT. SO THEY ARE GOING TO SUCK OUR JOBS AWAY, THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE CARS, TRUCKS, AND PARTS IN MEXICO. I SAID TO MYSELF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A RUBIO OR BUSH OR HILLARY WERE PRESIDENT. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. THEY WOULDN'T KNOW IT IS NO GOOD. THEY WOULD ALL KNOW IT IS NO GOOD. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. THE FOLLOWS HOUR THEY WOULD BE CALLED BY A LOBBYIST WHO GAVE THEM $5 MILLION, THE SPECIAL INTEREST THAT GAVE THEM $10 MILLION, THEY WOULD BE CALLED BY ONE OF THEIR DONORS WHO OWNS STOCK IN FORD OR WHATEVER WHO GAVE THEM $1 MILLION. THEY SAY, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. THEY WERE VERY HELPFUL IN YOUR CAMPAIGN TO BECOME PRESIDENT. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN? HE'LL SAY OR SHE'LL SAY I HAVE TO DO IT. THEY WILL SAY, NO, NO, YOU CAN'T DO. HE WILL SAY OKAY, I WON'T. THE PLANT IS GOING TO BE BUILT. NOW LET'S DO THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE. TRUMP IS PRESIDENT. THEY HAVEN'T GIVEN ME ANYTHING. I CALLED THE HEAD OF FORD. I WOULDN'T EVEN USE MY GUYS FOR THIS. THIS IS TOO EASY. HONESTLY IT IS TOO EASY. I CALL THE HEAD OF FORD. I SAY YOU ARE BUILDING A PLANT, YOU ARE GOING TO EMPLOY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. BUT YOU ARE NOT EMPLOYING PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU ARE EMPLOYING OTHER PEOPLE. I THINK THAT'S FINE. TELL ME HOW WE BENEFIT. HE'LL BE UNABLE TO EXPLAIN IT. HE CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. NOT TO ME. BELIEVE ME. I'LL SAY, LISTEN, I WANT YOU TO BUILD A PLANT IN MICHIGAN OR BUILD A PLANT HERE -- I DON'T CARE. I WANT THEM IN THE UNITED STATES. I'M TIRED WITH ALL OF THE CRAZY DEALS THAT WE MAKE AND THE NEW ONES WE'RE TRYING TO APPROVE. I'M TIRED OF THE JOB LIKE A VACUUM CLEANER. THEY SUCK THE JOB OUT OF THE CONSIDERATE, THEY SUCK OUR MONEY OUT OF THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE NOTHING. WE HAVE NOTHING. WE'RE LIKE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY. OUR AIRPORTS AND ROADS AND BRIDGES ARE FALLING DOWN. 61% OF OUR BRIDGES ARE IN TROUBLE. DO YOU BELIEVE THIS? WE DRIVE OVER A BRIDGE. IT IS IN TROUBLE. I WOULD SAY TO THEM THE FOLLOWS, I WON'T USE HIS NAME. HE HAPPENS TO BE A VERY GOOD GUY. I WOULD SAY -- LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING, I WANT YOU TO BUILD IT IN THE UNITED STATES. I DON'T WANT YOU LEAVING. IF YOU LEAVE AND INSIST ON LEAVING, YOU ARE NOT BRINGING THOSE CARS OVER FREE. YOU ARE NOT. YOU ARE NOT DOING IT. REMEMBER THE TRADE DEFICIT. REMEMBER HERE WE'RE TALK ABOUT 45 TO $50 MILLION. YOU ARE NOT BRINGING THEM OVER FREE. WE'RE GOING TO CHARGE YOU A 35% TAX ON EVERY CAR, TRUCK, AND PART THAT YOU BRING OVER. NOW I BELIEVE IN FREE TRADE. I'M A FREE TRADER. I ALSO WANT SMART TRADE. I WANT FAIR TRADE. IT'S GOT TO BE FAIR TRADE. FREE IS GOOD. ALL OVER. IT HAS TO BE FAIR SO WE CAN COMPETE. WHAT HAPPENS IS THE FOLLOWING. HE WILL CALL UP AND SAY WE WON'T DO THAT. I'LL BE HIT BY EVERY PERSON I KNOW IN WASHINGTON, ALL OF WHOM HAVE GIVEN ME NOTHING. IN FACT, I'VE GIVEN MOST OF THEM. I KNOW THE LOBBYIST. NOW THEY WILL CALL AND I'LL SAY, NO, WE HAVE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THEN I'LL BE CALLED BY EVERYBODY ELSE. I HAVEN'T TAKEN THEIR MONEY. I OWE THEM NOTHING. I ONLY OWE YOU PEOPLE. I OWE YOU IN PARTICULAR WITH THAT WONDERFUL LOCATION. RIGHT? I SAY -- I'LL SAY THE FOLLOWING, I'M SAYING NO, WE WANT YOU TO BUILD THAT PLANT IN THE UNITED STATES. IT IS GOING TO BE BUILT IN THE UNITED STATES. THEY WILL SAY, NO. I GUARANTEE YOU WITHIN 24 HOURS PROBABLY BY 5:00 THAT AFTERNOON, ASSUMING IT IS MADE AS WELL. THEY LIKE TO CALL AROUND LUNCHTIME. ASSUMING THE CALL IS MADE, BY 5:00, THEY WILL SAY, YES, MR. PRESIDENT, WE'VE AGREED. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD IN THE UNITED STATES. THE ONLY THING THAT COULD CHANGE IS THEIR TOUGH NEGOTIATORS. IT MAY TAKE AN EXTRA DAY. THEY MAY WAIT UNTIL 5:00. THAT'S THE ONLY THING. THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING. WE HAVE THE CARDS. SEE WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE, OBAMA THINKS THEY HAVE THE CARDS. WE HAVE THE CARDS. CHINA HAS CREATED ONE OF THE GREATEST STEPS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. IT IS TRUE. THEY HAVE SUCKED OUR ECONOMY DRY. IF YOU WANT TO DO BUSINESS IN CHINA, I HAVE MANY FRIENDS THAT ARE MANUFACTURERS AND I LOVE THESE GUYS. THEY ARE GREAT MANUFACTURERS. THEY CALL ME ALL THE TIME. THEY CANNOT GET THEIR PRODUCT INTO CHINA. THEY CAN'T DO IT. WHEN THEY DO, THERE'S A BIG TAX. WE ARE LIKE THE DUMMIES. BRING IT IN. FLOOD IT IN. THEN THEY DO THEIR CURRENCY MANIPULATIONS. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THE TRADE PACT DOESN'T WORK. HILLARY CLINTON WAS IN FAVOR OF MY SPEECH. IF SHE HAS TO DEBATE ME, SHE KNOWS SHE'S GOING TO GET KILLED ON THE TAX. I HAVE TO HAND IT IN HILLARY CLINTON, I HAVE TO HAND IT TO HER, YOU CAN ALL BE ANGRY. I HAVE TO HAND IT TO HER. IT TOOK GREAT COURAGE FOR HER TO GO AGAINST PRESIDENT OBAMA ON THE TRADE PACT. YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE SHE GETS INDICTED. BECAUSE SHE IS BEING TOTALLY PROTECTED BY THE DEMOCRATICS BECAUSE WHAT SHE DID IS ILLEGAL AND YOU LOOK AT GENERAL PETRAEUS. HE DID 5% -- A FRIEND OF MINE IS FAMILIAR. GENERAL PETRAEUS DID 5% OF WHAT SHE DID. THEY DESTROYED HIS LIFE. OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE FAR LESS. THE LIFE IS DESTROYED. THE DEMOCRATS AREN'T JUST PROTECTING HER. THERE'S NO REASON FOR THIS. I WANT IT TO GO A FAIR INVESTIGATION. LET EVERYTHING BE FAIR. WHAT'S HAPPENED IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. LET'S SEE IF SHE -- SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE OKAY LAST NIGHT. SHE DID. SHE DID OKAY. NOBODY ATTACKED HER. NOBODY ATTACKED HER. THERE WAS NO ATTACKS. YOU KNOW IN MY DEBATE, I HATE TO SAY IT, WE ARE LIVE ON CNN. IN MY DEBATE, THEY SAID MR. TRUMP, WHAT TO YOU THINK OF THIS? THEY SAID DONALD TRUMP CALLED YOU A HORRIBLE HUMAN BEING. IT WAS LIKE A REALITY TELEVISION SHOW. LAST NIGHT THEY ASKED A QUESTION, THEY WOULD GET AN ANSWER. WITH ME, EVERYTHING WAS AN ATTACK. IT IS CRAZY. EVERY POLL SAID I WON THE DEBATE. I'M HAPPY BE THAT. EVERY POLL. ""TIME"" MAGAZINE, EVERY POLL. IT WAS A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY. SO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. LET ME GIVE YOU ONE OTHER QUICK STORY. NABISCO OREOS ARE CLOSING THEIR PLANT AND MOVING TO MEXICO. I'LL NEVER EAT ANOTHER OREO AGAIN. NEVER. EVER. I'M GOING TO TALK TO THEM. I DON'T WANT THEIR COOKIES MADE AND SOLD IN -- I JUST DON'T WANT IT. IT IS UNFAIR TO US. CHICAGO IS LOSING THE LARGE PLANT. IT IS GOING TO ANOTHER COUNTRY. WE HAVE A THING CALLED CORPORATE INVERSION. THAT'S WHERE COMPANIES HAVE TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. THEY THINK MINIMUM $2.5 TRILLION. IT IS COVERED IN MY TAX PLAN. CORPORATE INVERSION. WE HAVE PEOPLE AND COMPANIES. IN THE OLD DAYS, THEY MOVED FROM NEW YORK TO FLORIDA TO TEXAS OR WHATEVER. NOW THEY'VE MOVED FROM THE UNITED STATES TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THEY TAKE ALL OF THE JOBS. ONE OF THE REASONS NAY ARE MOVING IS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET THE MONEY THAT THEY MADE OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES BACK INTO THE COUNTRY. YOU KNOW THAT EVERY SINGLE POLITICIAN PRACTICALLY IN WASHINGTON AGREES DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, THEY ALL AGREE WE SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO COME BACK. IT IS GOOD. THEY CAN'T AGREE. YOU KNOW WHY THEY CAN'T AGREE? BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A LEADER IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT'S REALLY WHY. WE DON'T HAVE A LEADER. THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE EVERY SINGLE POLITICIAN PRACTICALLY WANTS TO COME AND THEY CAN'T AGREE. WE'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG. REALLY WHAT IT IS, IT IS LEADERSHIP. IT IS LEADERSHIP. YOU GET THEM INTO THE ROOM AND YOU GET SOMETHING DONE. SO THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY THAT PEOPLE HAVEN'T SEEN HAPPEN IN 50 YEARS. I GOT A CALL THE OTHER DAY FROM A TREMENDOUS REPORTER. ONE OF THE FEW HONEST ONES. HE SAID HOW DOES IT FEEL? I SAID HOW DOES WHAT FEEL? WHAT YOU'VE DONE. THINK OF THIS. HE'LL TELL YOU EVERYBODY IS SURPRISED. I'VE SPENT SO MANY MONEY. I'M LEADING EVERY POLL, EVERYTHING. WHY? YOU KNOW, I WAS SUPPOSED TO -- I HAD A BUDGET. I LIKE BUDGETS. I'M A BUSINESS PERSON. WE ALL HAVE BUDGETS. I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE SPENT $20 TO $25 MILLION. I WOULD GOING TO SPEND A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ADVERTISING. WE'VE GONE SO FAR AND THE POLLS AND EVERYTHING ARE SO GOOD AND THE CROWDS ARE SO GREAT. I DON'T LIKE TO WASTE MONEY. WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF SPENDING? I GET SO MUCH ON TELEVISION. IT IS TRUE.   TONIGHT I'M DOING ""O'REILLY"" IF YOU ARE HOME. AN INTERVIEW IS BETTER THAN A COMMERCIAL. DON'T WE AGREE? COMMERCIAL YOU TURN IT OFF AND GO HOME. I LOOK AT SOME OF THESE GUYS. THEY'VE SPENT TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THEY HAVE 1%. I SAID TO MYSELF IS IT GOOD TO TALK ABOUT HOW LITTLE WE'VE SPENT OR BAD? IN ONE WAY, THEY SAY, HE SHOULD HAVE SPENT MORE. IN ONE WAY, I'M VERY PROUD OF IT. I'M VERY PROUD OF IT. VERY PROUD. NOW I'LL SPEND AS WE NEED TO. IT IS GREAT. THINK OF IT, I'VE SPENT THE LEAST OF ANYBODY AND I'M FIRST PLACE. IS THAT GOOD? RIGHT? AND I DON'T MEAN FIRST PLACE BY A LITTLE BIT. THERE WAS A GUY -- ANY BASEBALL FANS IN THE AUDIENCE? OKAY. ANYBODY EVER HEAR OF CHARLES O'FINLEY. HE HAD THE LOWEST PAYROLL IN BASEBALL, THE LOWEST PAYROLL, AND HE WON THE WORLD SERIES THREE TIME. HE HAD REGGIE JACKSON, TOLD HIM TO THE YANKEES. CATFISH HUNTER. SOLD HIM TO THE YANKEES. GEORGE STEINBRAWNER. HE WAS JUST FINE. HE WAS GREAT. HERE'S A GUY. THE LOWEST PAYROLL. THINK OF IT THE LOWEST PAYROLL BY FAR IN BASEBALL. YET HE HAD THE BEST TEAM. HE WON THREE WORLD SERIES IN A ROW. THERE'S SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL ABOUT THAT. TO ME. TO ME THERE'S SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL ABOUT THAT. WE'LL SPEND WHATEVER WE HAVE TO SPEND. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED THAT'S SO INCREDIBLE, I DID ""MEET THE PRESS."" HE HAD HIS HIGHEST RATINGS IN FOUR AND A HALF YEARS. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? I SAVED HIS JOB. I SAVED --    IT IS TRUE. I DID THE SAME THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS. THEY GOT TREMENDOUS RATE LINGS. THEY WERE DYING. THEY ASKED ME AGE. IT IS TO SHOW YOU IT IS TERRIBLE. MR. TRUMP, LEADING ALL THE POLLS, GETTING THE BIGGEST CROWDS, EVERYBODY IS GOING CRAZY. THEY SAID, MR. TRUMP, IS THERE ANY WAY THAT YOU'D GET OUT OF THE RACE? I SAID TO MYSELF THINK OF IT? WHO WOULD BE ASKED THAT QUESTION? WHO WOULD BE ASKED THAT -- WOULD ANYBODY ELSE BUT ME BE ASKED THAT QUESTION? IS THAT TERRIBLE? THEY SAID IS THERE ANY WAY TO GET OUT OF THE RACE. I THOUGHT I'D GIVE AN HONEST ANSWER. I SAID VERY, VERY HONESTLY, LOOK, WE'RE NUMBER ONE. IF WE WEREN'T AND IF EVERYTHING WENT DOWN, THE POLLS AND CROWDS AND YOU DON'T CALL BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT INTERVIEWS BECAUSE IT IS OVER -- LIKE SOME OF THE GUYS WE'RE RUNNING AGAINST -- I MEAN HONESTLY. IF I WERE SOME OF THE GUYS, WHAT'S THE PURPOSE? DO THEY GAIN SOMETHING BY HAVING ZERO? DO THEY GAIN SOMETHING AND GOING IN THE DEBATE? THEY CALL IT THE CHILDREN'S DEBATE. GUYS LIKE PATAKI. HE HAS ZERO. GUYS LIKE RAND. I HATE TO SAY IT. HE ATTACKED ME. HE WAS MUCH HIGHER WHEN HE ATTACKED. SO MANY -- I DON'T WANT TO USE NAMES. I REFUSE TO EMBARRASS ANYBODY. OKAY. SO I SAID TO THEM -- IF FOR SOME REASON EVERYTHING TANKS AND I WENT DOWN, I WOULD CERTAINLY CONSIDER IT. NEXT TO HEADLINES TRUMP CONSIDERING LEAVING. IT IS SO DISHONEST. IT TOOK A COUPLE OF UNBELIEVABLE POLLS TO STOP IT. IT TOOK A COUPLE OF UNBELIEVABLE POLLS WHICH I GET ALL THE TIME. I SAID WAIT A MINUTE. I DIDN'T SAY THAT. THEY PUT THAT STUFF OUT. IT IS SO FALSE AND SO DISBUSTING. REMEMBER THIS. MUCH OF THE PRESS HAVE BEEN TERRIFIC AND HONORABLE PEOPLE. I'VE MET SOME AMAZING PEOPLE. LIKE 30%. OKAY? THEN YOU HAVE 30% WHO ARE OKAY. THEY DO THEIR JOB. YOU HAVE 10 TO 15 TO 20% WHO ARE TRULY BAD PEOPLE. THEY ARE DISHONEST, THEY ARE HORRIBLE HUMAN BEINGS, THEY KNOW -- IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF BEING LAZY OR ANYTHING. THEY GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO WRITE FALSE STORIES. SOMEBODY ASKED ME TODAY I DID AN INTERVIEW TODAY. THEY SAID WHAT'S BEEN YOUR BIGGEST SURPRISE? I SAID I DON'T KNOW MY BIGGEST SURPRISE. MY MOST PLEASANT SURPRISE IS HOW BRILLIANT THE PUBLIC IS. THEY GET IT. THEY REALLY GET IT. BUT IT HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU BEFORE. A FRIEND OF MINE SAID HOW DO YOU DO THAT? YOU JUST SPEAK. IT IS AMAZING. BY THE WAY, NO DISRESPECT BUT EVERY PLACE I GO YOU WOULD LOVE THESE PEOPLE. WHETHER IT IS ALABAMA OR ALL OF THE OKLAHOMA, IT IS LIKE ALL THE TIME. THEY ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. YOU ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. THEY WANT TO -- IT IS TRUE. IT IS TRUE. THEY WANT TO SEE OUR COUNTRY BE GREAT AGAIN. THEY KNOW IT CAN BE. THEY WANT TO SEE IT HAPPEN. THEY WANT TO SEE VICTORY. WE DON'T WIN WITH ANYTHING. WE DON'T WIN WITH ISIS. WE DON'T WIN WITH IRAQ OR LIBYA. WE DON'T WIN WITH YEMEN. WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THAT. THEY ARE GOING TO SAUDI AH RAIN YA. WE WILL DEFEND THEM AND FOR NOTHING. EVEN THOUGH THEY MAKE $1 BILLION. I ORDERED 4,000 TELEVISION SETS RECENTLY. THEY COME FROM SOUTH KOREA. SOUTH KOREA MAKES A FORTUNATE AS A COUNTRY. WE DEFEND THEM. WE HAVE 28,000 SOLDIERS ON THE LINE. WE HAVE THE MANIAC OTHER THE OTHER SIDE. THEY PAY US NOTHING. WE DEFEND GERMANY. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW. WE DEFEND GERMANY. THEY ARE A BEHEMOTH. THAT WOULD GIVE US NOTHING. THEY GIVE US VIRTUALLY NOTHING. WE DEFEND JAPAN. WHY? I LOVE JAPAN. IT IS GREAT. WORK SOMETHING OUT. HELP US OUT. GIVE US SOMETHING. WE CAN GET RID OF ALL OF THE DEFICITS. WE CAN MAKE. WE CAN MAKE. IT IS TRUE. THEN YOU HAVE THE STUPID PEOPLE THAT SAY YOU CAN'T ASK FOR THAT. THEY ARE A SOVEREIGN NATION. SURE THEY ARE. YOU HAVE TO HELP US OUT. HERE'S THE DEAL WE HAVE WITH JAPAN. WE WILL DEFEND THEM TO THE DEATH. IF THEY GET ATTACKED, WE WILL FIGHT. WE HAVE TO FIGHT. IF WE GET ATTACKED, THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. THAT'S LIKE SERGEANT BERGDAHL. IT IS TRUE. WE HAVE A GUY SIX YOUNG PEOPLE WERE KILLED LOOKING FOR HIM. WE GET BERGDAHL, THEY GET FIVE OF THE GREAT KILLERS THEY WANTED FOR TEN YEARS; RIGHT? THESE ARE THE DEALS THAT WE MAKE. BECAUSE WE HAVE LEADERSHIP THAT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IT IS DOING. NOW IN THE OLD DAYS WITH BERGDAHL, WHO WAS A TRADER, IT WAS TREASON. YOU SHOOT HIM. HE GETS SHOT. YOU'VE BEEN READING THE NEWS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. THEY THINK HE WON'T EVEN GET JAIL TIME ANYMORE. HE HAS SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFICULTY. THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. HE WASN'T FEELING SO GOOD. WE ARE HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. YOU LOOK AROUND AT ALL OF THE PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT. IT IS HAPPENING. IT IS A MOVEMENT. THINGS ARE HAPPENING. IT IS A MOVEMENT. IT IS ABSOLUTELY A MOVEMENT. I GET CALLS. I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU FROM A HIGHLY RESPECTED GUY, HE SAID COULD I ASK YOU ONE QUESTION? HOW DOES IT FEEL? I SAID HOW DOES WHAT FEEL? WHAT YOU'VE DONE HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE IN POLITICS. YOU HAVE AN INSIDER. YOU CAME IN. THEY CALL IT THE SUMMER OF TRUMP. I HEAR THAT. THEY SAID IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE. THIS IS THE TOP GUYS. NEVER BEEN DONE. HOW DOES IT FEEL? I'LL BE HONEST, TO ME IT DOESN'T FEEL ANYTHING BECAUSE UNLESS WE WIN, I'VE WASTED MY TIME. AND ME SAID NO, YOU HAVEN'T. WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS INCREDIBLE. BY THE WAY, THAT WAS A WHILE AGO. I THINK HE'S AFRAID TO WRITE THE STORY. WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS INCREDIBLE. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. I'M TELLING YOU UNLESS I WIN, MEANING UNLESS WE WIN IN THE PRIMARIES, AND WE CAN'T HAVE THESE POLITICIANS ANY LONGER. WE CAN'T DO IT. WE CAN'T DO IT. ALL TALK. NO ACTION. ONE ABILITY. THEY HAVE AN ABILITY TO GET RE-ELECTED. THAT'S THEIR ONLY ABILITY. THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO. THEY HAVE TO GET RE-ELECTED. I TOLD HIM IF I DON'T WIN, I'D CONSIDER IT TO BE A MASSIVE FAILURES. THAT MEANS PRIMARIES AND ELECTION. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF FUN. NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN. I WATCHED HILLARY. WE'RE GOING IT GIVE THIS AND THAT. SHE'S GOT TO GIVE EVERYTHING AWAY. THE MANIAC STANDING ON HER RIGHT IS GIVING EVERYTHING AWAY. SHE'S FOLLOWING. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. THIS SOCIALIST/COMMUNIST -- OKAY. NOBODY WANTS TO SAY IT. NO. IN ALL FAIRNESS TO HER, SHE'S STANDING THERE LISTENING TO THIS GUY. HE'S GOING TO ATTACK YOU PEOPLE AT 90%. GOING TO TAKE EVERYTHING. NOBODY HAS HEARD THE TERM COMMUNIST. I CALL HIM A SOCIALIST/COMMUNIST. THAT'S WHAT HE IS. THEN YOU SEE HER STAND UP. NOW IT IS HER TURN. SHE GOES I'M GOING TO DO THAT TOO. YOU HAVE TO WIN. SHE'S NOT DOING SO WELL. IN A HEAD TO HEAD POLL, I BEAT HER BY FIVE OR SIX POINTS. I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL. HERE'S THE STORY. YOU ARE GOING TO LOOK AROUND AND REMEMBER THIS NIGHT. BECAUSE AS A VERY IMPORTANT PERSON TOLD ME, THIS IS NOT JUST CROWD GATHERED. THIS IS A MOVEMENT. THIS IS A MOVEMENT GOING ON. WHEN YOU ARE LEADING BY 20 AND 25 POINTS, WHEN YOU ARE LEADING IN SOUTH CAROLINA BY 20, WHEN YOU ARE LEADING IN ALL OF THESE PLACES, NEVADA, AND LEADING WITH THE HISPANICS, LEADING WITH THE HISPANICS --    BECAUSE THEY KNOW I CREATE JOBS. THEY ARE HERE LEGALLY. THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE TAKING THEIR HOUSES AND RUNNING ALL OVER THE PLACE. THEY WANT WHAT THEY HAVE. THEY WANT IT TO GET BETTER. THEY WANT JOBS. SO WHEN WE'RE LEADING BY 20 POINTS, 25, ONE OF THE POLLS HAD A 40% ABOVE EVERYBODY ELSE. THAT'S A MASSIVE NUMBER. THOSE ARE MASSIVE NUMBERS. THIS PERSON SAID THIS IS A MOVEMENT. THIS IS NO LONGER WE'RE PLAYING GAMES. THIS IS A MOVEMENT. YOU KNOW, THEY ALL SAID HE'S NEVER GOING TO RUN. HE'S GOT A WONDERFUL LIFE. I DO. I DO. BUT THEY SAID HE'S NEVER GOING TO RUN. HE'LL NEVER FILE FORM A. FORM A IS WHERE YOU SIGN YOUR LIFE AWAY. HE'LL NEVER BUT THE IN THE FINANCIALS BECAUSE HE'S PROBABLY NOT AS WEALTHY AS PEOPLE THOUGHT; RIGHT? I HAVE ALMOST 100 PAGES OF FINANCIALS. THEN THEY SAID HE'LL PUT THEM IN, BUT WAY LATE. IF I PUT HIM IN, AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, I COULD HAVE HAD MANY -- THEY PUT HIM IN LACES IN ONE PAGE. THEY ARE LATE. THEY NEED AN EXTENSION. TRUE STORY. THEY SAY HE'LL NEVER PUT IN HIS FINANCIALS. I WAS SO HAPPY TO PUT THEM IN. IF I DIDN'T RUN, I MIGHT HAVE PUT THEM IN. I LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE. I DID A GOOD JOB. YOU KNOW? I DID A GOOD JOB. SO I PUT IN MY FINANCIALS. I CALL THEM THE TALKING HEADS. THEY ARE ALL DEVASTATED. HE WASN'T RUNNING. HE WILL NEVER FILE OR THIS OR THAT. I PUT IN MY FINANCIALS. IT TURNS OUT MY COMPANY IS BIGGER, BETTER, STRONGER, MUCH BIGGER THAN ANYBODY THOUGHT. WE BECOME DOWN HERE AND WE HAVE THE BIGGEST WINERY IN THE EAST COAST, AND WE HAVE THE GREAT LAND ON THE POTOMAC RIVER. THEY DON'T KNOW THAT. YOU PEOPLE KNOW IT BECAUSE YOU ARE FROM","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Rally in Richmond, Virginia"

THAT'S SOME GROUP OF PEOPLE. SO WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT FOR OUR COUNTRY, FOR OUR ECONOMY, AND FOR GETTING US ALL WORKING AGAIN, AND WORKING WELL AGAIN. IT'S A TAX REFORM THAT I THINK WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG AND GREAT AGAIN. TOO FEW AMERICANS ARE WORKING, TOO MANY JOBS ARE BEING SHIPPED OVERSEAS, AND TO MANY MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES CANNOT MAKE ENDS MEET. THIS PLAN DIRECTLY MEETS THESE CHALLENGES, AND THE CHALLENGES ALSO A BUSINESS. IT WILL PROVIDE MAJOR TAX RELIEF FOR MIDDLE INCOME AND FOR MOST OTHER AMERICANS. THERE WILL BE A MAJOR TAX REDUCTION. IT WILL SIMPLIFY THE TAX CODE. IT WILL GROW THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AT A LEVEL THAT IT HASN'T SEEN FOR DECADES. AND ALL OF THIS DOES NOT ADD TO OUR DEBT OR OUR DEFICIT, BUT I WILL ALSO BE DISCUSSING SOME OF THAT AT THE END BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE MUCH BETTER DEALS, WE HAVE TO NEGOTIATE MUCH HARDER, AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE OUR ECONOMY STRONG. CHANGES FOR INDIVIDUALS WILL BE AT LEVELS THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IN A LONG TIME. WE'RE GOING TO CUT THE INDIVIDUAL RATES FROM SEVEN BRACKETS TO FOUR. SIMPLIFICATION. 25%, 20%, 10% AND ZERO. IF YOU ARE SINGLE AND EARN LESS THAN $25,000 PER YEAR, OR MARRIED AND JOINTLY, AND JOINTLY EARN LESS THAN 50,000, SO VERY IMPORTANT. IF YOU'RE SINGLE AND EARN LESS THAN 25,000 OR MARRIED AND JOINTLY EARN LESS THAN 50,000, YOU WILL NOT PAY ANY INCOME TAX, NOTHING. THIS ELIMINATES VERY STRONGLY AND QUICKLY THE MARRIAGE PENALTY, VERY UNFAIR PENALTY THAT IT ELIMINATES THE AMT WHICH IS THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX. IT ENDS THE DEATH TAX, THE DOUBLE TAXATION. AND LOTS OF FAMILIES GO THROUGH HELL OVER THE DEATH TAX. IT REDUCES OR ELIMINATES MOST OTHER DEDUCTIONS AND LOOPHOLES AVAILABLE TO SPECIAL INTERESTS, INTOAND TO THE VERY RICH. IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S GOING TO COST ME A FORTUNE, WHICH IS ACTUALLY TRUE. WHILE PRESERVING CHARITABLE GIVING AND MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTIONS. VERY IMPORTANTLY. IT ENDS THE CURRENT TAX TREATMENT OF CARRIED INTEREST. THOSE OF THE HEDGE FUND FOLKS THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR QUITE A WHILE. MAKE A LOT OF MONEY, CARRIED INTEREST. SO IT ENDS THE CURRENT TAX TREATMENT OF CARRIED INTEREST, THE SPECULATIVE PARTNERSHIPS THAT DID NOT GO BUSINESSES OR CREATE JOBS AND ARE NOT RISKING THEIR OWN CAPITAL. CHANGES FOR BUSINESS, NOW, SO IMPORTANT, BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT BUSINESS, IT'S ALL ABOUT JOBS. WE HAVE 93 MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT ARE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE DON'T WANT TO WORK. THEY CAN'T WORK. SO FOR BUSINESS, NO BUSINESS OF ANY SIZE, FROM A FORTUNE 500 COMPANY TO A MOM AND POP SHOP, TO A FREELANCER LIVING FROM GIG TO GIG WILL PAY MORE THAN 15% OF THEIR BUSINESS INCOME IN TAXES. BIG REDUCTION. A ONE TIME DEEMED REPATRIATION OF CORPORATE CASH HELD OVERSEAS AT SIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED WHICH COMING BACK AT A SIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED, 10%. SO IT COMES BACK DISCOUNTED AT A 10% TAX RATE, IT ENDS THE DEFERRAL OF TAXES ON CORPORATE INCOME EARNED ABROAD. NOW, IT'S CALLED CORPORATE INVERSION. IT'S A HUGE SUBJECT. I'VE BEEN WATCHING POLITICIANS NOW FOR YEARS, ALL TALK, NO ACTION POLITICIANS. I'VE BEEN WATCHING THEM FOR YEARS TALKING ABOUT BRINGING THIS MONEY BACK. THE NUMBER IS PROBABLY $2.5 TRILLION. EVERYBODY AGREES IT SHOULD COME BACK, REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, EVERYBODY. THEY CAN'T MAKE A DEAL. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT MAKING A DEAL TO THE REASON COMPANIES ARE NOT BRING IT BACK IS THAT TAXES OWNERS TO GET DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO BRING BACK ARE, IN FACT, MANY COMPANIES ARE LEAVING THE UNITED STATES, THEY ARE LEAVING OUR SHORES TO GO AND COLLECT THEIR MONEY, THEY'RE GOING ACTUALLY MOVING OUT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR TWO REASONS. THAT TAXES ARE TOO HIGH, AND BECAUSE THEY TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT THEY CAN'T BRING BACK INTO THIS COUNTRY WHEN EVERYBODY WANTS HIM TO BRING IT BACK IN. IT'S CALLED LEADERSHIP. WE WILL HAVE THAT MONEY BROUGHT BACK IN IT AS AN EXAMPLE OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVERSEAS. I CAN'T BRING IT BACK INTO THIS COUNTRY. WE FILE PAPERS. WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A YEAR AND HAVE. WE CAN'T GET IT BACK IN THE SO THE MONEY STAYS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED, NOT GOOD FOR US. THE LEVEL OF LEADERSHIP THAT WE NEED TO GET THINGS LIKE THIS DONE IS SO IMPORTANT, BUT THIS IS SOMETHING, AND I CAN WATCH IT FOR A LONG TIME, EVERYBODY AGREES. WE ALSO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE SOME BUSINESS LOOPHOLES, MANY OF THEM ACTUALLY COME AND DEDUCTIONS MADE UNNECESSARILY OR REDUNDANT BY THE NEW LOWER TAX RATE ON BUSINESS INCOME. ATTACKS RIGHT NOW IS SO LOW THAT A LOT OF THESE DEDUCTIONS WHICH ARE COMPLICATED WHICH DON'T MAKE SENSE AND WHICH ARE UNFAIR ARE GONE. AND WE FACE AND A REASONABLE CAP ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE BUSINESS INTEREST EXPENSE. SO WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU, WE HAVE A VERY COMPLEX SET OF PAPERS THAT ACTUALLY IF YOU KNOW BUSINESS IS NOT SO COMPLEX, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE HIM RIGHT NOW TO THE PRESS PICK I THINK YOU WILL SEE WE HAVE AN AMAZING CODE. IT WOULD BE SIMPLE. THEY WILL BE D.C. IT WILL BE FAIR. IT'S GRADUATED AS YOU GET UP IN INCOME, YOU PAY A LITTLE MORE. SOME OF THE VERY UNFAIR DEDUCTIONS THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GIVEN WHO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE ANY LONGER, BUT I BELIEVE THEY WILL DO BETTER BECAUSE I THINK THE ECONOMY WILL GROW. IT WILL GROW RAPIDLY AND WILL HAVE SOMETHING FOR SPECIAL. NOW, WITH ALL OF THAT BEING SAID AND BEFORE WE TAKE SOME QUESTIONS, WE HAVE TO CUT THE COSTS OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE DOING AND THE MONEY WE ARE SPENDING, I READ WHERE A WASHER, YOU KNOW AND WASHER IS REX NUTS, BOLTS, A WASHER. TO SEND FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER, IT WAS A 19-CENT WASHER AND IT COST 1900 SOME ODD DOLLARS TO SEND IT FROM HERE TODAY. THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES, HAMMERS TO COST $800 THAT YOU CAN BUY IN A STORE FOR A TINY AMOUNT OF MONEY. WE WILL RUN THESE COUNTRY PROPERLY. THERE IS SO MUCH MONEY TO BE SAVED. WE ARE REDUCING TAXES BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF I WIN HIM IF I BECOME PRESIDENT, WE WILL BE ABLE TO CUT SO MUCH MONEY AND HAVE A BETTER COUNTRY. WE WON'T BE LOSING ANYTHING OTHER THAN WE WILL BE BALANCING BUDGETS AND GETTING THEM WHERE THEY SHOULD BE. SO THIS IS THE PLAN THAT SIMPLE, THAT'S A MAJOR REDUCTION. I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE VERY HAPPY. WE'VE ALREADY HAD SOME VERY GOOD REVIEWS. I DID THE PLAN FOR LEADING SCHOLARS AND ECONOMISTS AND TAX EXPERTS THAT ARE IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY LOVE IT. THEY SAY, WHY HASN'T THIS BEEN DONE BEFORE? AND THIS IS MY WHEELHOUSE. THAT'S WHAT I.T. WILL. THE ECONOMY IS WHAT I DO WELL. WHENEVER THEY DO POLLS I ALWAYS COME OUT WIT ABOVE EVERYBODY ELSE ON THE ECONOMY. AND ON LEADERSHIP BY THE WAY, BUT I WON'T SAY THAT. SO IF ANYBODY HAS --  WOW. THANK YOU. THAT'S AMAZING. THAT'S SOME OF THE PRESS WAS ACTUALLY CLAPPING. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN THAT BEFORE. WHY DON'T WE TAKE SOME QUESTIONS FROM THE PRESS? YES, GO AHEAD.  >> NO, I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT YET. I HAVE TO GET APPROVAL BUT WE'VE HAD SOME OF THE TOP PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY LOOK AT IT. WE ARE LOOKING AT 3%, IT COULD BE SIX. WE'LL HAVE GROWTH THAT WILL BE TREMENDOUS. AND BY THE WAY, IF WE HAVE MORE THAN THREE, THESE NUMBERS ARE REALLY SPECTACULAR. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IN ANY BIG LEAGUE FASHION IS THE COUNTY. IT IS SO MUCH WASTE AND I BELIEVE WHAT I GET INTO I WILL BE ABLE TO CUT WITHOUT LOSING ANYTHING, TOOK A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OFF OF COME AND WE'RE NOT EVEN SHOWING ANYTHING ON THAT SO THEY'RE VERY CONSERVATIVE NUMBERS. YES, SARAH.   >> YEAH.   >> MY TAXES, MY TAXES WELCOME PERSONAL ITEM MUCH SIMPLER TAX STATED THAT IT WILL BE MUCH SIMPLER. WHEN I DO MY RETURN IT WILL BECOME MY RETURNS GO TO THE CEILING AND BEYOND, WHICH IS RIDICULOUS. YOU SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT A HIGH LEVEL ON LAWYERS, ACCOUNTANTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. WE WANT TO SIMPLIFY THEM TO A TREMENDOUS LEVEL. THE BRACKET OF 25, A BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT MANY OF THE LOOPHOLES AND MANY OF THE DEDUCTIONS WHICH ARE OLD AND A BEEN THERE FOR YEARS, ANTIQUATED IN MANY CASES OR ARE PUT THERE BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT GET THESE DEFECTIONS ARE CONTRIBUTED TO HILLARY, THEY ARE CONTRIBUTING TO BUSH. THAT CONTRIBUTE TO EVERY CANDIDATE THAT DROVE BECAUSE I'M NOT TAKING ANY MONEY. I'M STILL FUNDING TO THESE PEOPLE WANT THESE DEDUCTIONS. THERE WILL BE PEOPLE, WE ARE REDUCING TAXES BUT BELIEVE ME THERE WILL BE PEOPLE IN THE UPPER ECHELON THAT WILL NOT BE THRILLED WITH THIS. WE ARE TAKING AWAY DEDUCTIONS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WERE ABLE TO LOWER ITS SO.   >> IS ACTUALLY A TAX REDUCTION. A BIG TAX REDUCTION, CODING FOR THE UPPER INCOME. I BELIEVE THE ECONOMY WILL DO SO WELL THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY WON'T BE GETTING CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS, WHICH ARE NOT FAIR FOR THEM TO BE GETTING BACK TO END UP DOING BETTER. YES, GO AHEAD.   >> I JUST THINK THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH. WE COULD SAY SUPPLY SIDE, YOU CONSIDER SEEKING GIVEN NAMES GIVEN ARE FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF REDUCTIONS OR INCREASES. I DON'T THINK IT'S SUPPLY-SIDE OR ANYTHING ELSE BUT I THINK THIS IS A COMMON SENSE, WELL THOUGHT OUT TAX PROPOSAL THAT'S GOING TO TRIGGER THE ECONOMY, CLINIC EVERYBODY GO BACK AND WOULD WANT TO WORK OR IT'S GOING TO GREAT TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF JOBS. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I'M COUPLING THIS WITH IS IF I BECOME PRESIDENT I'M GOING TO RENEGOTIATE OUR TRADE DEALS. OUR TRADE DEALS ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE BY THIS COUNTRY, NOT SUSTAINABLE. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO LET OUR JOBS GO TO ALL THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THERE'S NOT A COUNTRY THAT WE NEGOTIATE WITH THAT DOESN'T MAKE A BETTER DEAL TO WE LOSE MONEY WITH EVERYTHING. I'M ALSO GOING TO RENEGOTIATE SOME OF OUR MILITARY COSTS BECAUSE WE PROTECT SOUTH KOREA. WE PROTECT GERMANY. WE PROTECT SOME OF THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, SAUDI ARABIA. WE PROTECT EVERYBODY. WE PROTECT EVERYBODY, AND WE DON'T GET REIMBURSED. WE LOSE ON EVERYTHING. WE LOSE ON EVERYTHING. SO WE ARE GOING TO NEGOTIATE AND WE NEGOTIATE TRADE DEALS, MILITARY DEALS, MANY OTHER DEALS THAT'S GOING TO GET THE COST DOWN FOR RUNNING OUR COUNTRY VERY SIGNIFICANTLY. I'M NOT SHOWING A BIG NUMBER IN THAT BUT I BELIEVE THAT IF I BECOME PRESIDENT THOSE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO BE MASSACRED AS AN EXAMPLE SAUDI ARABIA. AND MAKE A BILLION DOLLARS A DAY. WE PROTECT THEM. SO WE NEED HELP. WE ARE LOSING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY ON A YEARLY BASIS AND WE GO $19 TRILLION I USED TO SAY 18. NOW WITH NIKE TO GET ONLY GOING UP. YES, TOM.   >> LOOK, LOOK. SENATOR RUBIO IS A LIGHTWEIGHT. WE UNDERSTAND THAT HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THIS. HE WOULD KNOW THAT TAKE YOU FROM ANY OTHER DEAL. AND WHAT CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET HIS THEIR TIME TO TAKE A WE JUST WENT UP IN THE LAST POLL. WE WENT UP TWO POINTS IN THE LAST POLL THAT WE CONTINUE TO CORPORATE ENTITY SQL I THINK WE WENT FROM 26 THAT'S WHEN I. WE'RE GOING UP STRONG IN THE POLLS. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. I BUILT A GREAT COMPANY. YOU WILL SEE THAT IN 60 MINUTES LAST NIGHT. IT'S A PHENOMENAL COMPANY WITH VERY LITTLE DEBT, TREMENDOUS CASH FLOW. I'M FINDING MY OWN CAMPAIGN. GUYS LIKE RUBIO, HE DESPERATELY NEEDS MONEY. ASK A CAR DEALER IN FLORIDA, ASK THE PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT HIM. AND A GUY LIKE RUBIO AND OTHERS CAN I DO WHAT DOES INCLUDE A. YOU ARE SINGLING HIM OUT, BUT THEY ARE LARGELY CONTROLLED BY THEIR DONORS AND SPECIAL INTERESTS AND, FRANKLY, MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE, THE LOBBYIST. I'VE TURNED DOWN MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM LOBBYISTS AND SPECIAL INTEREST BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING. IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT AND THAT SEEMS TO BE RESONATING VERY STRONGLY. YES.   >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.   >> NEGOTIATE, THAT'S TRUE, I DO. I GET BILLS FROM PEOPLE IN A NEGOTIATE. IS THAT A BAD THING? THE COUNTRY COULD DO THAT. I WOULD BRING THAT SAME ATTITUDE TO THE WIDEST AND THAT'S TRUE. SHE SAYS I HAVE A HABIT WHEN YOU GET A BILL COME YOU CALL UP AND YOU NEGOTIATE. TO ME THAT THE COMPANY. I WANT TO TAKE THAT THINKING TO THE WHITE HOUSE. I WOULD BET YOU BIGOTED 20% OF OUR BUDGET I COULD SAY MORE BUT WE COULD HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT. THAT HAS TO BE THE ATTITUDE OUR COUNTRY HAS. YOU CAN'T SPEND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON DOING SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO FOR $2000. WE LOOK AT COSTS. WE JUST SPENT $1 MILLION BUILDING A SOCCER FIELD, OKAY? A SOCCER FIELD, FOR OUR PRISONERS THAT HAPPENED TO BE IN GUANTANAMO, OKAY? I DON'T LIKE THAT. WHAT YOU NEED A MILLION DOLLARS FOR? LEVEL OUT THE SERVICE, LET THEM PLAY, IF THEY HAVE TO PLAY IT ALL. WHAT YOU NEED TO SPEND A MILLION DOLLARS? WE JUST SPENT COME INTO THE STORE TODAY. I MILLION DOLLARS ON A SOCCER FIELD? HOW DO YOU SPEND AN ADULT ON A SOCCER FIELD QUICK YOU HAVE A LEVEL PIECE OF LAND. SO THAT IT ALL. WHY DO THEY EVEN COME WHY ARE THEY PLAYING SOCCER IS MY QUESTION. OKAY. YES, SIR, GO AHEAD.   >> NO, IT'S TOO LONG. YOU DON'T HAVE TIME. YOU ARE NOT TIMED. GO AHEAD. WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD?   >> RIGHT.   >> NO, NOT AT ALL. WE ARE LOWERING TAXES WHICH REPUBLICANS LOVE. AND I THINK WHAT ARE THE REASONS I AM DOING SO WELL IN THE POLLS AND ONE OF THE REASONS I'M DOING SO WELL WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMY IN ALL POLLS IS THAT THIS IS THE THING. WE ARE LOWERING TAXES OR SUBSTANTIALLY, SIMPLIFYING AND GETTING RID OF DEDUCTIONS THAT ARE ACTUALLY OBSOLETE THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE WANT TO KEEP FOR CERTAIN REASONS. SO NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE. YES, SIR. GO AHEAD.   >> WELL, WHO WAS INTERVIEWED AND I WAS INTERVIEWED LAST NIGHT I THOUGHT HIS INTERVIEW. I SAW CHARLIE ROSE DID AN EXCELLENT JOB BUT I THOUGHT IS WAS A SOFTWARE ENTITY. SCOTT KELLY INTERVIEWED ME. I THOUGHT SCOTT WAS TERRIFIC. IT WAS A TOUGH INTERVIEW I THOUGHT HE WAS VERY FAIR. AND I THOUGHT THE PIECE WAS VERY GOOD. GO AHEAD.   >> EASY HARDER ON ME THAN PUTIN? I WOULD SAY BECAUSE PUTIN IS A NICER PERSON THAN I AM. OKAY, GO AHEAD.   >> RIGHT, RIGHT.   >> THE WORST IN 36 YEARS. OKAY. IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND YOU CAN CONNECT THE DOTS BUT I GUESS IT HAS BEEN PROBABLY SINCE 2004. TALKING ABOUT 12 YEARS THAT PEOPLE WANTED TO BRING THE MONEY BACK INTO THE COUNTRY, AND AGAIN IS CALLED CORPORATE INVERSION A LOT OF TIMES THE CORPORATION ARE MOVING OUT AND GOING TO OTHER COUNTRIES, TAKING JOBS. NOW WE HAVE A REALLY BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE WE SERIES COMPANIES, VERY LARGE AS YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT BUSINESS, BUT WE HAVE MAJOR COMPANIES LOOKING TO MOVE OUT OF THE UNITED STATES. IT USED TO BE THEY WOULD MOVE FROM NEW YORK TO FLORIDA OR FROM NEW JERSEY TO TEXAS OR WHATEVER. NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MOVING FROM THE UNITED STATES TO IRELAND AND ENGLAND AND TO OTHER PLACES, TO SPAIN WHERE THEY GET TREATED DIFFERENTLY. AND, FRANKLY, BETTER. THEY'RE DOING THAT FOR A NUMBER OF THE REASONS BUT ONE OF THE BIG REASONS AS YOU IS TAXES. ONE OF THE OTHER REASON IS TO GET ALL OF THIS CASH THEY BUILT UP AND THEY CAN'T GET BACK INTO OUR COUNTRY. WINS MONEY COMES BACK INTO OUR COUNTRY, THAT EVERYBODY WANTS, IT WILL BE PUT TO WORK IN OUR COUNTRY LARGELY. IT CAN GO OTHER PLACES BUT LARGELY. AND I THINK IT WOULD BE AN AMAZING BOON. HERE'S THE OTHER THING. THEY THINK IT IS $2.5 TRILLION. I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT. I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S GOING TO BE MORE MONEY THAN THAT. AND BOY, IF IT IS, WE HAVE HIT PAY DIRT. GO AHEAD REAL FAST.   >> WELL, YOU KNOW WHEN TO END THE REPATRIATION, WHEN YOU GET THE MONEY COMING BACK AND BEYOND, TREMENDOUS THINGS HAPPEN. SERA, GO AHEAD.   >> WELL, I WILL BE ANNOUNCING THAT IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE. I WILL BE HONEST, I'M THE ONLY HONEST ABOUT THE I WATCHED, I PAY SO MUCH ATTACKS. I WATCH ALL POLITICIANS AND THE SAKE I FIGHT LIKE HELL TO PAY AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE. CAN I SAY THAT I'M NOT A POLITICIAN. I FIGHT LIKE HELL ALWAYS BECAUSE IT'S AN EXPENSIVE AND YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL, I FIGHT, I HAVE THE BEST LAWYERS AND THE BEST ACCOUNTS AND I FIGHT, AND I PAY. BUT IT'S AN EXPENSE. AND, FRANKLY, I WOULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY IF THIS COUNTRY WERE SPENDING THE MONEY WISELY INSTEAD OF THROWING IT OUT THE DREAM. OUR COUNTRY SPEND OUR MONEY SO STUPIDLY, AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT I CAN SPEAK FOR MYSELF, I PAY A LOT OF TAX BUT I FIGHT LIKE HELL TO MAKE IT AS LOW AS POSSIBLE. BUT I WOULD FEEL A LOT DIFFERENTLY IF OUR LEADERSHIP WAS SUCH THAT I RESPECTED THE DECISION. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT THE LIST OF THE THINGS THAT OUR GOVERNMENT IS SPENDING MONEY ON RIGHT NOW, AND YOU DON'T FEEL SO GOOD ABOUT OUR COUNTRY. YES.   >> WELL, I'LL TO YOU WHAT COME IN TERMS OF INCOME AND EQUALITY WE WILL CREATE A LOT OF JOBS. YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A FALSE 5.4, 5.3, 5.6 COME EVERY MONTH IT IS TO DO. IT'S SUCH A PHONY NUMBER BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AND LOOK IN LOOK AND THEN THEY GIVE UP LOOKING FOR A JOB, THEY ARE TAKING OFF THE ROLL SO THE NUMBER IS NOT REFLECTED I SEE NUMBERS OF 24% ARE ACTUALLY SAW A NUMBER OF 42% UNEMPLOYMENT. 42%. AND IT COULD BE BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A JOB AND YOU GO AROUND AND YOU LOOK AND YOU LOOK AND YOU FIND AND YOU WANT TO WORK AND YOU WANT TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR FAMILY, AND THEN YOU CAN'T GET THE JOB, YOU KNOW I TALK ABOUT BECAUSE YOU'RE SHAKING YOUR HEAD, AND YOU CAN'T GET THE JOB, ESSENTIALLY FOR STATISTICAL PURPOSES YOU ARE CONSIDERED EMPLOYED. SO THAT I READ EVERY TIME IT COMES OUT, I HEAR 5.3% UNEMPLOYMENT, THAT ISN'T THE BIGGEST JOKE THERE IS IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT NUMBER IS SO FALSE. PEOPLE ASK HOW, TRUMP IS DOING SO WELL, AND CARSON AND OTHERS, HOW COME -- YOU KNOW WIPEOUTS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF ILLEGAL SPEAK. THEY ARE TIRED OF THE. THE WORST EXAMPLE OF IT, ONE OF THE WORST EXAMPLES IS A PHONY UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS PROBABLY 20% BUT I WILL TELL YOU, GET SOME GREAT ECONOMIST THAT WILL TELL YOU IT'S A 30, 32. THE HIGHEST I'VE HEARD SO FAR IS 42%. THERE'S ANGER OUT THERE AT THE JOB PICTURE. NOW, ONE OTHER THING. WITH THAT BEING SAID, CHINA, JAPAN, MEXICO, BRAZIL, THESE COUNTRIES ARE ALL TAKING OUR JOBS THAT WE ARE A BUNCH OF BABIES. THAT WILL STOP. PEOPLE WILL TREAT US FAIRLY IF I BECOME PRESIDENT. ..  >> HE'S GOING TO HAVE MORE MONEY TO SPEND IN THE ECONOMY, SO THAT'S GOOD. YES, MA'AM?   >> SHOULD CHRIS CHRISTIE WHAT?   >> I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT. YEAH, GO AHEAD.   >> NO I'M NOT A POPULIST. I'M A MAN THAT BUILT A TREMENDOUS COUNTRY WITH THE BEST REAL ESTATE. I HAVE MANY OF THESE. I'VE DONE A GREAT JOB. I'VE EMPLOYED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. I EMPLOY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. I'VE DONE A GOOD JOB. I'M A MAN OF COMMON SENSE. I'M CUTTING TAXES, CREATE A LOT OF JOBS, I'M GOING TO GET A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WASTE. THE WASTE THAT I GET RID OF IS GOING TO HAVE A HUGE IMPACT AND I'M NOT PUTTING THAT IN MY NUMBERS. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE TERRIFIC. HOW ABOUT ONE MORE QUESTION? GO AHEAD.   >> YES, THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL WAY OF DESCRIBING IT. WHERE ARE YOU FROM? ENGLAND. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL ACCENT. I WANT TO GET THE INDUSTRY, WE ALL IT THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY TO BUILD FACTORIES HERE. FORD IS BUILDING A TWO AND A HALF BILLION FACTORY IN MEXICO. MEXICO TOOK A BIG PLANT OUT OF TENNESSEE. I WANT THE MOTOR COMPANIES AS YOU WOULD SAY OR AUTOMOBILE COMPANIES TO BUILD THE PLANTS IN THE UNITED STATES. I DON'T WANT NABISCO LEAVING TO MEXICO OR ANYWHERE ELSE. ALL OF THESE PLACES WHERE THEY ARE LEAVING AND THEY ARE GOING TO OTHER COUNTRIES, I WANT THEM TO STAY HERE AND THEY WILL STAY HERE AND BE SO HAPPY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, IT'S BEEN A GREAT HONOR. THANK YOU, THANK YOU.  [INAUDIBLE",Presidential Candidate Donald Trump News Conference on Tax Policy

GOOD MAN, GOOD MAN. THANK YOU, TIM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. WELCOME WE JUST HAD AN AMAZING DAY. I WAS IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE STATE AND WE HAD SOME INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. AND I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA.  I HAVE TO SHOW YOU. SO IT'S JUST GET A ABOUT THE PRESS. HE KNOWS ABOUT THE PRESS. TIM KNOWS. EITHER WAY, WAS I WANTED HER FIRST SUPPORTERS EVER COME AND MAYBE YOUR FIRST? BEFORE HE WAS, WHO KNOWS, BEFORE HE BECAME THIS BIG SHOT, RIGHT? I FEEL -- WE ARE PROUD OF HIM, THAT I CAN TELL YOU.   >> SO WE JUST GOT THESE POLL NUMBERS AND DOING GREAT IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 39% ARE DO YOU BELIEVE THIS, 39.  AND PSYCHOBABBLE TO YOU, PSYCHIC JUST ONE AND THEN THEY GO DOWN TO 11. WE WERE DOING PRETTY WELL AND WE HAVE TO GET THEM IF WE DID CALL FOR THE ELECTION TOMORROW. IN SOME COUNTRIES YOU CAN CALL FOR THE ELECTION. LET'S DO IT. DO IT TOMORROW. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I WAS EXPLAINING BEFORE, THE BIG HEADLINE IN FLORIDA, RUBIO AND BY THE WAY, HAS THE HIGHEST IN THE ENTIRE SENATE, THEY DO NOT SUPPOSE TO SAY THIS BUT HE MISSED FOUR DAYS MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE SENATE TO LISTEN TO THIS. WILL BE A PASSIONS -- PASSES BUSH. THIS IS THE HEADLINE, NICE, RIGHT? PEOPLE ARE HAPPY ABOUT THAT. RUBIO PASSES BUSH IN FLORIDA POKER I SAID THAT'S TOO BAD. I THOUGHT I WOULD DO GREAT IN FLORIDA. THATCHER ATLANTIC AND EVERY THE STORY, DONALD TRUMP IS LEADING 31.5 -- CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? IS GREAT.  RUBIO IS THAT 19-POINT TO COME AND BUSH'S 11.3. BADLY THAT PUT ME IN HEADLINE AND I AM CRUSHING IT. YOU ALL FIGURE THAT OUT. THE PRESS IS RIGHT IS ONLY. NOT ALL THAT BUT MUCH OF IT. I DID WANT TO SAY IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE AGAIN ASKED ME TO BE AND I TELL YOU WHAT, HE'S A SPECIAL PERSON AND ANYTIME HE WANTS YOU TO COME TO SOUTH CAROLINA I AM HERE.  I MEAN IT. I MEAN IT. AND HE'S GOING TO GRILL ME NOW. THIS IS AS A SECOND AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE A SPEECH? HE SAID NO, THIS IS QUESTION AND ANSWER. I SAID GOOD, THAT'S EASY, I LIKE IT BETTER. I HOPE HE'S NOT GOING TO BE LIKE MIKE WALLACE OF THE OLD DAYS, RIGHT? LET'S SIT DOWN. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. GREG, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU.   >> BEAUTIFUL. HELLO, FRANCIS.  SHE DID A GOOD JOB. SHE DID A GOOD JOB. LOOK AT THIS GUIDE.  >> OKAY. WE HAVE TO GET RID OF AT LEAST SOME OF THE DEBT IF NOT ALL. WE ARE UP TO $19 TRILLION EVERY COUNTRY THAT IS IN SERIOUS DEBT. I WANT TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE. WE WANT TO REPEAL IT.  AND WE WANT TO REPLACE IT IF WE WANT TO REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING TERRIFIC AND WE HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS. THERE SO MANY OPTIONS. I DON'T KNOW OPTIONS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SEE YOUR PREMIUMS ARE GOING THROUGH THE ROOF, RIGHT? THEY'RE GOING TO THE ROUGH. THEY ARE UP 40, 50% OF ONE PERSON SAID TO ME YESTERDAY 55%. I THINK A THIRD THINK THE BIG MILITARY. WE WANT TO BUILD UP THE MILITARY.  AS PART OF THAT. I SAY IT ALL THE TIME. I THINK IT WOULD BE MY STRAIGHT. ANYONE SAYS JOBS WILL BE MY STRENGTH I THINK THAT WILL BE. CNN DID A POLL FOR I WAS THROUGH THE ROOF ON JOBS AND LEADERSHIP. AND A LITTLE BIT LESS WHEN HE CAME TO PERSONNEL AT THE CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? IT? LAST NIGHT BUT I SO WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? WE HAVE TO WIN A LITTLE BIT. THE OTHER THING SO IMPORTANT MILITARY AND VERY, VERY IMPORTANT IS TAKING CARE OF OUR VETERANS. OUR VETERANS --  OUR VETERANS ARE TREATED LIKE THIRD CLASS CITIZENS. THE ILLEGALS THAT COME INTO THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN MANY CASES, YOU GO TO CALIFORNIA THEY ARE GETTING DRIVERS LICENSES. GETTING TAKEN CARE BETTER THAN OUR FANS. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IF I WIN. THAT I CAN TELL YOU.   >> GOOD. SO THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUESTIONS BECAUSE IF YOU REMEMBER WHEN I ANNOUNCED THREE MONTHS AGO THAT I WAS RUNNING, I MADE STATEMENTS AND AGO AND THOUGHT IT WAS THEN ABOUT A WEEK LATER RUSH LIMBAUGH SAID NOBODY HAS EVER RECEIVED SO MUCH INCOMING. INCOMING. I NEVER DISTORT INCOMING, MEANING TO PRESS. I BROUGHT UP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. IT TURNED OUT I WAS RIGHT. UNIT SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH CRIME AND YOU HAVE SO MUCH, YOU HAVE KATE IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH SUCH A SHAME, SHOT IN THE BACK BY SOMEBODY OVER HERE FIVE TIMES, SIX TIMES, I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MAY TIMES, BUT YOU HAVE KATE, A WOMAN TWO WEEKS AGO IN CALIFORNIA WAS 66 YEAR OLD VETERAN, A VETERAN RAPED, SODOMIZED AND KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE YOU HAVE THOUSAND OF THESE CASES. IT'S A HORRIBLE PROBLEM. YOU HAVE THE DRUGS FLOWING ACROSS THE BORDER AND JEFF OUR MONEY FLOWING OUT OF. WE GET THE DRUGS, THEY GET THE MONEY. AND, FRANKLY, I THINK THAT TIM IS BRING THAT UP IS THE SECOND QUESTION A LOT OF TIMES IT'S THE FIRST QUESTION TO IF I WERE NOT INVOLVED, IF I WERE NOT IN THIS CAMPAIGN THAN IF I WERE SITTING IN NEW YORK DOING NOTHING RIGHT NOW WHICH WOULD BE EASY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID WHY WOULD YOU EVER RUN AND HE'S GOT LIKE THIS NIGHTS LIFE OF WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. SO IMPORTANT.  BUT I THINK IF I DID WHEN HE WOULD EVEN BE ASKING THE QUESTION ON IMMIGRATION BECAUSE IT'S A QUESTION WAS EVEN THINKING ABOUT. NOBODY WAS EVEN THINKING ABOUT. I WATCH THESE POLITICIANS -- WE ARE EXCLUDING TIM BY THE WAY. I WATCH THE THESE POLITICIANS AFTER ALL TALK, NO ACTION TO NOTHING WOULD EVER HAPPEN. WE WILL HAVE A WALL NOT OF WHAT WE BUY A LETTER THAT IS 10 FEET AND GO TO THE TOPIC THIS WILL BE A WALL AND IT WILL COME IN AT THE RIGHT COST AND MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL. BELIEVE ME. MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL. AND JUST TO FINISH, I LOVE MEXICO. I LOVE MEXICAN PEOPLE. THE MEXICAN LEADERSHIP IS TOO SMART FOR OUR LEADERSHIP. THEY ARE TINY, SHARP, SMART GRID PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND WE ARE GOING TO PEOPLE, GREAT NEGOTIATORS THAT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND WILL MAKE THEIR DEALS. RIGHT NOW I WAS TELLING TIM BEFORE, I ASKED HIM WHY PEOPLE COME WHAT IS THE TRADE DEFICIT WITH MEXICO? IT'S LIKE $45 BILLION. YOU CAN'T GET -- WE CAN GET INTO PAY FOR IT. ANYBODY IN THIS AUDIENCE AS A MESSENGER CAN DO THAT. WHAT'S THE TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA? IT'S ALMOST $400,000 A YEAR. 400 BILLION. WHAT'S THE DEFICIT WITH JAPAN? IT'S ALMOST $70 BILLION. ARE WE CRAZY? THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN WITH TRUMP, BELIEVE ME.   >> SO WE CAN WOULD BE THE ENERGY CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE SO MUCH FOR TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE NO IDEA THAT WE WERE SITTING ON THE KIND OF RESOURCES THAT WERE ACTUALLY ON. AND WITH PROPER WORK AND PROPER -- I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG TIME 30 TO $40. PEOPLE HAVE HEARD ME WHEN IT WAS GOING AT 100. I WAS SAYING IT SHOULD BE 30, 25, 40 AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE TRUE. WE HAD A CASE WHERE THOUSANDS TO HUNDREDS OF SHIPS WERE OUT AS HE LOADED UP. THEY HAD SO MUCH OIL THEY NEVER KNEW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IS OPEC IS BEING BROKEN UP. THE MONOPOLY IS BEING BROKEN UP AND THINGS CAN HAPPEN THAT WOULD BE GREAT WITH RESPECT TO ENERGY A WE HAVE TO HELP PEOPLE OUT. THE PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE THAT THE BRUNT OF ENERGY AND ENERGY COSTS ARE THE VERY POOR PEOPLE. I'VE HEARD NUMBERS 25, 20%. WE WILL DO THAT TO WHAT THE DEFENSE WILL DO IS GET ENERGY PRICES DOWN EVEN FURTHER. THE OIL COMPANIES WILL NOT BE THRILLED A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL NOT BE THROWN BATTER INTO THIS IS THE ENERGY SHOULD BE COMING DOWN ACTUALLY A LOT FURTHER AND I THINK IT WILL.   >> SO, MY WHOLE LIFE I'VE BEEN WORKING TO BUILD A GREAT COMPANY. I BUILD A TRULY GREAT COMPANY, SO THE GREAT ASSETS OF THE WORLD, TURN BURIED IN SCOTLAND, TRUMP TOWER SO MANY GREAT ASSETS, 40 WALL STREET OPPOSITE THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, MANY, MANY ICONIC AND WONDERFUL AS IT. AND I BUILT A NETWORK THAT IS OVER $10 BILLION WITH TREMENDOUS CASH FLOW WITH VERY LITTLE DEBT, AND IT'S AN AMAZING COMPANY. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT WE HAD TO DO THAT NOW. OTHER PEOPLE TO GO OUT. THEY HAVE TO DO IT. YOU NEED THE AMERICAN DREAM. I TALK ABOUT THIS ALL OF THE TIME. AGAIN, THE PRESS, I'M AFRAID TO SAY I CAN NEVER SAY THE AMERICAN DREAM IS DEAD BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS CUTTING OFF. I SEEM TO CONTAIN IS DEAD BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT BIGGER AND BETTER AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. AND MY WIFE COMES HOME. ACID WHICH WILL? CHEESELIKE VERY UPSET. I SAID WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU SHOULDN'T SAY THE AMERICAN TRADE IS DEAD. THAT'S TOO HARSH FOR I SAID YOUR RIGHT BUT THEY DID SAY THEY. I SAID THE AMERICAN DREAM IS DEAD A WE'RE GOING TO MAKE BIGGER AND BETTER AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. I TURN ON THE TELEVISION, I TURNED ON AND THEN TRUMP AND THE AMERICAN DREAM IS DEAD. AND I DIDN'T GET. I SAID WOW, THAT'S TERRIBLE. LOOK, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE AMERICAN DREAM, BRING IT BACK, BRING IT BACK SO THAT PEOPLE CAN REALLY DRINK AGAIN. I HAVE SO MAY PEOPLE SAYING THAT YOU CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. YOU CAN BUILD THESE GREAT COMPANIES ANYMORE. YOU CAN EITHER BUILD SMALL BUSINESSES BECAUSE OF REGULATION. I COULD NAME HUNDREDS OF BILLS, YOU LOOK AT THE REGULATIONS THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO EVEN PUT UP A HOUSE LET ALONE DO A BUSINESS. WE CAN GET RID OF PROBABLY 75% OF THE REGULATIONS AND BEEN IN MANY WAYS MORE THAN THAT.  SO THEY GOING TO BRING THE AMERICAN DREAM BACK TO THIS COUNTRY, CREATE JOBS BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THEM BACK FROM CHINA AND FOR GOING TO TAKE THEM BACK FROM JAPAN AND WERE GOING TO GET ALONG WITH CHINA AND JAPAN. WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THE WE'LL HAVE OUR NEGOTIATE WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE POLITICAL HACKS. WITH PEOPLE THAT GAVE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GET JOBS IN THE COVER. I'M SO FUNDING BY THE WAY. I DON'T KNOW IF I GET ANY CREDIT FOR THIS. I DON'T KNOW IF I GET CREDIT. I REALLY DON'T. I FEEL FOOLISH. PEOPLE WANT TO GIVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BUY CAMPING AND I SAID I'M NOT TAKING IT. I FEEL FOOLISH. IT'S LIKE SORT OF A THE WAY MY MIND WORKS. I CAN WATCH THE MILLIONS. TAKE IT AM I SUPPOSED TO GET I FEEL FOOLISH. I DON'T KNOW, I'M SO FUNDING, THE ONLY ONE CELL PHONE TO GET ALL OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE, AND I'M FINDING THE SUPER PACs, IT'S RIDICULOUS. THEY ARE CONTROLLING THE POLITICIANS. THEY ARE CONTROLLING THE PACKET -- THE POLITICIANS ARE I THINK IT'S TERRIBLE. PEOPLE ARE PUTTING MONEY INTO THEM, MILLIONS AND THEY DON'T LIKE TRUMPET I HAVE ALL THESE ADS AGAINST ME AND ATTENDED OF COURSE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT IT. THEY PUT THEIR BEST FRIEND IN CHARGE. APPLICABLE IN CHARGE OF THE PAC AND TO NEVER EVER SPEAK. I VEGGIE CHILI, IT'S DISGRACEFUL AND THEY'RE BREAKING THE LAWS BUT ATTACKS ARE NOW CONTROLLING EVERYTHING. THE PEOPLE THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PACs ARE REALLY ON A VERY, ON A RAZOR EDGE OF THE CANDIDATES ARE BEING CONTROLLED BY A PAC. HIMSELF A VICTIM PUTTING UP MY OWN MONEY. WHEN I FLY HERE I'M PAYING FOR IT 100%. THAT'S THE WAY IT IS THE THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. I DO SAY ONE THING --  I JUST WENT AND I WAS PREFACE THIS, HOWEVER, I'D LOVE TO MY OF WOMEN, AND WOMEN CONTRIBUTE LIKE $7.40 WITH A THREE-PAGE LETTER TO I PEOPLE TO GET CONTRIBUTE TO MY CAMPAIGN. IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY BUT I LOVE, THE WORST THING I COULD DO SEND BACK SMALL AMOUNTS OF MONEY. THE WEEKS OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF MONEY BECAUSE THEY ARE INVESTING IN THE CAMPAIGN THAT THEY ARE INVESTING FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY. THEY ARE NOT INVESTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING. AND I WAS SAYING TO SOMEBODY PEOPLE ARE GETTING 100, 200, 500 IF I SEND BACK THOSE CHECKS AND WE DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY CAN IS ALMOST INSULTING BUT THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT LOVE THE COUNTRY. THE PEOPLE THEY GIVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, OF WHICH I THEN WENT OVER THE YEARS CAN NOBODY KNOWS THE SYSTEM BETTER THAN I DO, I MUST TELL YOU. THAT'S WHY I'M COMING AT IT --  >> I'M COMING AT IT FROM A POINT OF ADVANTAGE BECAUSE I WAS ON THE SYSTEM AND THE SYSTEM IS THAT THE SYSTEM. WHEN SOMEBODY IS GIVING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO POLITICIANS OR IPAD AND WHEN A POLITICIAN IS IN OFFICE AND THEY WANT SOMETHING DONE, THEN I THINK ABOUT THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY TO GET THINK ABOUT THE GOOD OF THE DONOR ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE NOT FINISHED RUNNING FOR OFFICE AGAIN.  SO I'M THE ONLY PERSON COME ON THE ONLY ONE RUNNING TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THAT IS SO FUNDING. THAT'S THE WAY I WANT TO KEEP IT. THANK YOU.   >> IT IS GOING TO BE SPECIFIC  AND CREATE INCENTIVES AND BE A  PLAN THAT WILL MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY OTHER THAN THE HEDGE FUNDS GUY  WHO MAKE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS AND DON'T PAY A LOT OF IN TAXES. I THINK THEY WILL ALL BE MY ENEMIES. YOU KNOW THE TRUTH? I THINK THEY WILL DO BETTER  BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS GOING TO  BE BETTER. WE WILL PRODUCE JOBS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW WHAT CORPORATE INVERSION IS BUT COMPANIES WANT TO LEAVE THE UNITED STATES BOUGHT THE TAXES ARE TOO HIGH. THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE. YOU HAVE PROBABLY 2.1 TO 2.5  TRILLION SITTING OUT OF THE  UNITED STATES AND THEY CANNOT  GET THE MONEY BACK BECAUSE THE TAXES ARE TOO HIGH. YOU HAVE CORPORATIONS WHO WOULD HAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT  SHOULD BE IN THE COUNTRY BUT THE COMPANIES CAN'T BRING THE MONEY IN. SO THEY GO OUT AND THEY LEAVE  THE COUNTRY TO GET THEIR MONEY  AND ALSO TO GET LOWER TAXES AND OTHER THINGS. SO THE CORPORATE INVERSION I BELIEVE WILL STOP. THE DEMOCRATS WANTED TO PUT A  LAW AGAINST IT. BUT IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. THE CORPORATIONS WILL STAY, BRING THE MONEY BACK AND PUT IT  TO WORK IN THIS COUNTRY AND IT  IS SO EASY. THE THING THAT BOTHERS ME IS DEMOCRATS AGREE, REPUBLICANS AGREE, EVERYBODY AGREES, THEY  HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR  THREE YEARS AND IT NEVER GETS DONE.  >> I DO THINK THIS, TIM, WHEN  YOU ABOUT TALK ABOUT THE INVERSION, I THINK IT IS A VERY  IMPORTANT SUBJECT. ISN'T EXCITING TO PEOPLE. BUT YOU HAVE MAJOR, MAJOR  CORPORATIONS LOOKING TO LEAVE  THIS COUNTRY WITH THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF JOBS AND GREAT  COMPANIES. THEY ARE GOING OTHER PLACES WHERE THE TAXES AND CORPORATE  TAXES ARE LOWER AND THEY HAVE  CERTAIN OTHER ADVANTAGES. WE HAVE BEEN SMART INTO THE COUNTRY. WE NEED SOMEONE GREAT TO BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL OF YOU.   >> IN COLORADO, THE RIVER WAS GOLD AND YELLOW AND THE EPA DID IT. THE EPA IS ONE YOU WOULD  CERTAINLY, AT A MINIMUM, CUT WAY BACK AND MAYBE GET RID OF. YOU LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, BUSH LIKES COMMON CORE. HE WANTS YOUR CHILDREN IN SOUTH  CAROLINA TO BE EDUCATED THROUGH THE BUREAUCRATS. YOU HAVE NICE AND GOOD PEOPLE  BUT HOW CAN YOU VOTE FOR THAT? I GO TO IOWA, NEW HAMPSHIRE,  MANY PLACES INCLUDING NEW YORK,  AND CALIFORNIA, AND EVERYBODY  AGREES WITH ME ON THIS AND YET YOU HAVE THIS MASSIVE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. LOCAL EDUCATION WHERE THE  PARENTS CAN WORK WITH THE  TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT.   >> AND BY THE WAY, WE ARE RANKED NUMBER 25 IN ONE POLL AND 28 IN ANOTHER. YOU ARE DOUBLE. WE SPEND THE MOST PER STUDENT BY FAR, NOT EVEN CLOSE, YET 25 AND NUMBER 28 IN THE VARIOUS RATING POLLS. IT IS CRAZY. SO DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL BE ANOTHER ONE.   >> THE IRANIAN DEAL IS THE WORST ONE I HAVE SEEN. IT IS THE MOST INCOMPETENT DOCUMENT I HAVE SEEN. IT IS GOING TO LEAD TO NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION. IT WAS DONE BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T  HAVE A CLUE. WE DON'T GET OUR PRISONERS BACK  EVEN. WE HAVE FOUR PRISONERS OVER THERE AND THEY DIDN'T ESC N ASK. WE ARE GIVING THEM BACK. THINK ABOUT IT. WHO WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE NEGOTIATING? TRUMP OR THE CLOWNS NEGOTIATING RIGHT NOW? HE FALLS OFF THE BICYCLE RACE, KERRY IS OFF, HE IS OUR CHIEF NEGOTIATOR. I TELL PEOPLE I PROMISE IF I AM PRESIDENT I WILL NEVER GO INTO THE BICYCLE RACE BECAUSE I WILL  NOT HAVE TIME. I WILL BE WORKING. THE 24 DAYS EVERYONE KNOWS AND  THAT DOESN'T START THE INSPECTION PERIOD. THE CLOCK COULD KEEP IT LONGER  THAN 24 DAYS. THEY COULD CLEANUP AND NOT KNOW A DAMN THING. THERE ARE SO MANY ELEMENTS AND  WHEN TIM MENTIONED ISRAEL THERE  IS A CLAUSE IN THERE NO ONE  UNDERSTAND THAT IF IRAN GETS ATTACKED WE HAVE TO HELP THEM. AND NOW YOU SAY WHAT IF ISRAEL  ATTACKS THEM ARE WE SUPPOSED TO  BE FIGHTING ISRAEL? THIS IS THE MOST INCOMPETENT  AGREEMENT ANYBODY HAS EVER SEEN. WE WILL PROTECT ISRAEL TOTALLY.  >> IT IS NOT EVEN BELIEVABLE. BUT THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THERE  AND THEORY THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO  COME TO THE DEFENSE OF IRAN. YOU KNOW THERE IS TOTALLY UNBALANCED AND WE PROTECT EVERYBODY. THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING FOR US. IF WE GET ATTACKED, JAPAN DOESN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. IF JAPAN GETS ATTACKED WE HAVE TO GO FIGHT FOR THEM. ALL OF OUR AGREEMENTS ARE LIKE THAT. WE ARE RUN BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO CLUE. IF WE GET ATTACKED JAPAN CAN SIT THERE AND WATCH IT ON TELEVISION THAT MAY MAKE BY THE WAY. WE DON'T MAKE THEM. BUT IF JAPAN GETS ATTACKED, WE  HAVE TO DEFEND THEM. ALL OF OUR DEALS ARE LIKE THAT. YOU TAKE SOUTH KOREA. I ORDERED 4,000 TELEVISION SETS  FOR A BIG JOB AND THEY ALL CAME  FROM SOUTH KOREA -- SAMSUNG, LG, ALL OF THEM BUT SONY. EVERY TIME NORTH KOREA OPENS ITS UP AND GETS ANGRY THAT DAY AND WE START UP THE SHIPS AND PLANES AND WE GET NOTHING. WE HAVE 28,000 SOLDIERS SITTING  IN BETWEEN THIS POTENTIAL DISASTER. IT IS ONE THING IF WE ARE -- SOMETHING HAS TO HAPPEN. SOMEBODY SAID TO ME, WHAT A HORRIBLE THING TO ASK FOR PAYMENT THAT MAKES THEM A FORTUNE. WE OWE TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY. WE ARE UP TO $19 TRILLION. WE CANNOT PROTECT THE WORLD. WE PROTECT GERMANY. GERMANY. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE A MERCEDES BENZ? WE PROTECT JAPAN. WE PROTECT SOUTH KOREA. WE PROTECT EVERYBODY. AND THEY ALL THINK WE ARE STUPID. THEY THINK WE ARE STUPID. WE ARE RUN BY, OTHER THAN TIM, VERY STUPID PEOPLE. >> SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT ARE  HARD TO BELIEVE, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS JUST STARTED THE PROCESS OF  LOOKING FOR WAYS TO REGULATE THE INTERNET. AND HE IS USING LEGISLATION FROM THE 1930S.  >> I KNOW WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH  FOR YEARS WITH THAT.  >> WHAT THEY PUT YOU THROUGH IS INCREDIBLE. THINKING BOEING ALMOST SAID WE  ARE NOT COMING. A BIGGER PROBLEM, I TOOK OUT OF THE NEWSPAPER TODAY, IS BOEING  IS GOING TO BUILD A MASSIVE PLANT IN CHINA. THEY WANTED TO BUILD A BIG PLANT IN CHINA AND I THINK THAT IS GOING TO HAVE A HUGE IMPACT. I THINK IT IS INTERESTING. THEY CAN MAKE THEIR PRODUCT IN CHINA AND SEND IT TO US. IF WE SEND PRODUCT TO THEM THEY  WANT US TO THINK OF IT. WE HAVE TO BUILD PLANS IN CHINA BIT -- BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO HERE. I READ THE STORY AND THERE WAS  SUCH GREAT INTEREST THEY WERE ORDERING PLANES BUT BOEING IS BUILDING MASSIVE AIRPLANE  FACTORIES IN CHINA. I DON'T LIKE THAT. I REALLY DON'T LIKE THAT.   >> WELL MAYBE IN TERMS OF  BUSINESS DECISION ALWAYS FAMILY, AND CHILDREN AND WE -- THE  CHILDREN -- I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL BUT NOT  HAPPY PEOPLE. YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND THEY ARE NOT HAPPY. HAVING A HUSBAND, WIFE,  CHILDREN, IS REALLY MORE IMPORTANT. I HAVE SEEN EVERYTHING. I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE WITH ENORMOUS WEALTH AND MISERABLE AT HOME AND PEOPLE WITH MODEST INCOME THAT ARE HAPPY. I DEFINE SUCCESS BY A PERSON  BEING HAPPY AND THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN BILLIONS IN THE BANK. ONE OF THE GREATEST DECISIONS I  MADE WAS COMING FROM MANHATTAN TO QUEENS. I HAUNTED TO BUILD IN MANHATTAN. MY FATHER WAS A BUILDER IN BROOKLYN AND QUEENS AND WE BUILT MIDDLE AND LOW INCOME HOUSING. I SAID POP, I WANT TO BUILD BUILDINGS AND IT WAS SOMETHING  THAT WAS SO EXCITED. I LEFT AND ENDED UP DOING THE  GRAND HYATT HOTEL AND MANY BUILDINGS. TRUMP PALACE AND IT HAS BECOME JUST GREAT. WE ARE ALL OVER THE WORLD. ONE OF THE REASONS PEOPLE NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD RUN IS THEY SAID WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT? I WANT TO DO IT BECAUSE I FEEL I OWE SOMETHING. I FEEL I OWE SOMETHING.  >> MY RELATIONSHIP WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE AND  BUSINESSES HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. I SPOKE IN FRONT OF THE  AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE TODAY, WENT THERE, AND FLEW OVER HERE. MY RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN GREAT. TRUMP RECEIVED 25% OF THAT VOTING BLOC IN THE NATIONAL ELECTION ACCORDING TO A REPORT TODAY. IT IS A GREAT POLL. IT IS 25%. YOU WERE SAYING GENERALLY SPEAKING A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WOULD RECEIVE WHAT?  >> 4-5%. IF YOU GET TO 25% THE ELECTION IS OVER.  >> IT IS LUCKY I HAD THE REAL  POLL IN MY HAND. YOU KNOW, 25% OF THE GENERAL ELECTION MATCH UP AND THAT IS AN ENORMOUS NUMBER AND I THINK IT WILL BE HIGHER THAN THAT. I HAVE HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, I HAVE HAD A GREAT  RELATIONSHIP WITH HISPANICS AND  I HAVE BEEN SAYING I WILL WIN THE HISPANIC VOTE BUT BECAUSE OF THE STATEMENTS ON IMMIGRATION A LOT OF PEOPLE DISAGREE. THEY CAME OUT WITH A POLL IN THE STATE OF NEVADA WHERE I WON THE  STATE EASILY AGAINST ALL OF THE  REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES BUT I WON THE HISPANIC VOTE AND PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED. HISPANICS ARE HERE. THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH A LONG  PROCESS AND ARE HERE LEGALLY. I HAVE EMPLOYED THOUSANDS OF HISPANICS AND RIGHT NOW IN MANY PLACES I HAVE THOUSANDS OF HISPANIC EMPLOYEES AND I THINK I AM GOING TO WIN THAT VOTE. SO IT IS -- MAYBE IT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. BUT I WILL SAY AFRICAN-AMERICAN GREAT RELATIONSHIP. HISPANIC, A REALLY GOOD  RELATIONSHIP AND I THINK PEOPLE  ARE GOING TO SEE THAT AS WE PROGRESS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BOTH  GROUPS REALLY LIKE IS THE FACT I AM GOING TO CREATE JOBS. NO BODY IS GOING TO CREATE JOBS.  >> POLITICIANS ARE MORE DISHONEST. I THOUGHT THE REAL ESTATE GUYS  WERE THE WORSEMENT. I HAVE SEEN A GREAT DISHONEST IN POLITICS. IT IS A MIXED BAG. IT IS A MIXED BAG. IN POLITICS AND REAL ESTATE IT IS CUT-THROAT. IN POLITICS, I MET WONDERFUL  PEOPLE AND REALLY BAD PEOPLE. REALLY DISHONEST PEOPLE. AND AT SOME POINT, WE HAVE TO DO TO A BOOK ON THIS STUFF. BUT I MET SOME GREAT PEOPLE INVOLVED.  >> YOU KNOW WHAT IS INTERESTING? THE MEDIA AND POLITICS IS MUCH  DIFFERENT THAN THE MEDIA IN  FINANCE. MAYBE FINANCE IS EASIER BECAUSE IT IS MORE NUMBERS BASED. BUT I MET WONDERFUL PEOPLE IN  THE MEDIA AND POLITICS BUT  REALLY DISHONEST MEDIA FOLKS IN  HAVING TO DEAL WITH POLITICS. IT IS A MIXED BAG. BUT I THINK POLITICS WOULD BE MORE DECEPTIVE THAN REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT. NOT AN EASY LIFE. I MET WONDERFUL PEOPLE BUT MET  REALLY BAD PEOPLE AS WELL.  >> MY ENEMIES SAY HE VOTED FOR  OBAMA. I HELPED JOHN MCCAIN. HE DID A BAD JOB AND DIDN'T GET  ELECTED. I HELPED ROMNEY, HE DIDN'T GET ELECTED. THIS TIME I SAID I AM DOING IT MYSELF. LAST TIME I THOUGHT WE SHOULD  HAVE WON. IN ALL FAIRNESS, MCCAIN HAD THE PROBLEMS AND I THINK LINCOLN  COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ELECTED THERE. ROMNEY SHOULD HAVE WON. HE CHOKED AND SOMETHING HAPPENED. HE CHOKED LIKE A GOLFER ON THE 18TH HOLE. THAT WAS AN ELECTION THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN WON. I THOUGHT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA, THE ONE THING I THOUGHT IS HE  WOULD BE A GREAT CHEERLEADER FOR THE COUNTRY AND BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AND HONESTLY  THERE IS PROBABLY A DIVIDE RIGHT NOW IN THE COUNTRY WITH THE LIKES WE HAVE NOT SEEN FOR MANY YEARS. YOU KNOW IT BETTER THAN I DO, SIR. AND PEOPLE TALK ABOUT MY TONE  AND MY TEMPERMENT. I HAVE A GREAT TEMPERMENT. I A GREAT TEMPERAMENT. I THINK I WILL GET ALONG WITH  PUTIN AND BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER. WHEN YOU LOOK AT BALTIMORE --  THE BALTIMORE THING WAS SO BAD. YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON IN  FERGUSON AND ST. LOUIS. WE HAVE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. WE NEED JOBS AND SPIRIT AND MAYBE JUST AS MUCH AS WE NEED  JOBS. WE WILL BRING THEM TOGETHER AND  MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN AND I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. THIS IS GREAT. >","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Town Hall in Columbia, South Carolina"

THIS IS SOME TURN OUT. MY GREAT HONOR. A CHAIRMAN JUST LEFT, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW. HE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY FAIR. THE RNC HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC OVER THE LAST TWO MONTHS. THAT IS WHAT I HAVE WANTED. I HAVE WANTED FAIRNESS. I DO NOT HAVE TO BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN ANYBODY ELSE. I JUST WANTED FAIRNESS FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE ARE LEADING IN EVERY SINGLE PULPIT A NEW POLL CAME OUT TODAY WHERE WE ARE OVER 30%. WE HAVE ACTUALLY HIT NUMBERS AS HIGH AS 35 AND 40%. FRANKLY, I FELT THE ABSOLUTE BEST WAY TO WIN AND TO BEAT THE DEMOCRATS AND VERY EASILY, I THINK IT, BEAT THE DEMOCRATS NO MATTER WHO IT IS HILLARY OR ANYONE ELSE, AND I THINK HILLARY WILL HAVE A HARD TIME FRANKLY WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING GETTING TO THE STARTING GATE. THE BEST WAY IS IF I WIN THE NOMINATION AND GO DIRECTLY AGAINST WHOEVER THEY HAPPEN TO PUT UP. FOR THAT REASON, I HAVE SIGNED THE PLEDGE.   SO I WILL BE TOTALLY PLEDGING MY ALLEGIANCE TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE CONSERVATIVE VEGETABLES FOR WHICH IT STANDS AND WE WILL GO OUT AND FIGHT HARD AND WE WILL WIN. MOST IMPORTANT LIKE, WE WILL MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT.   WITH THAT COME ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS?   THIS IS A SELF-FUNDED CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE OUR HEART AND SOUL IN IT. I DO NOT NEED MONEY AND I DO NOT WANT MONEY. THIS WILL BE A CAMPAIGN LIKE NO OTHER, I THINK. I AM NOT CONTROLLED BY LOBBYISTS OR ANYBODY. I'M CONTROLLED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN. YES, SIR.  I REALLY GOT NOTHING. THE QUESTION WAS, WHAT DID I GET FOR SIGNING THE PLEDGE? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, OTHER THAN THE ASSURANCE THAT I WILL BE TREATED FAIRLY. I HAVE SEEN THAT OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS. THEY REALLY HAVE BEEN VERY FAIR. NO, I HAVE NO INTENTION OF CHANGING MY MIND.   THE BIG THING THAT HAS CHANGED, AND IT HAS BEEN OBVIOUS TO ALL, AFTER I ANNOUNCED, WE WENT UP LIKE A ROCKET SHIP. NO ONE SAID I WOULD RUN AND THEY SAID HE WILL NOT RUN. I DID THAT. THE PAPERS, IN TERMS OF THE COMPANY, TURNED OUT TO BE SPECTACULAR. IT IS A GREAT COMPANY. I BUILT A GREAT COMPANY. ALL THE OTHERS TURNED OUT TO BE VERY WELL RECEIVED. THE THING THAT CHANGED IS THE FACT THAT I WENT TO THE NUMBER ONE PLACE VERY QUICKLY AFTER I SIGNED AND AFTER I, IN THIS BUILDING, NOTIFIED EVERYBODY THAT I WOULD BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. THE BIGGEST THING IS THAT I WENT EARLY TO NUMBER ONE AND THE RNC HAS TREATED ME WITH GREAT RESPECT. THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT. YES. NO, I SEE NO CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH I WOULD TEAR UP THAT PLEDGE. >>   YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE MET WHEN YOU'RE AT 2%.   IT IS ONE OF THE THINGS, THAT IS THE WAY LIFE WORKS. I LIKE GOVERNOR CHRISTIE, BY THE WAY. THE CHAIRMAN ASKED IF HE COULD COME UP YOU SAW HIM HERE IN LITTLE WHILE AGO. I WAS GREATLY HONORED THAT HE DID COME UP, FRANKLY. >>   WELL, I THINK WHEN YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT, WE ARE A NATION THAT SPEAKS ENGLISH. I THINK WHILE WE ARE IN THIS NATION, WE SHOULD BE SPEAKING ENGLISH BEAR THAT IS HOW ASSIMILATION TAKES TO WHETHER PEOPLE LIKE IT OR NOT, THAT IS HOW WE ASSIMILATE AND HOW WE GO ONTO TO THE NEXT PHASE IN THE NEXT STAGE. I AM NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT SPANISH. I'M TALKING ABOUT FROM VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD. THAT IS HOW THEY WILL BECOME SUCCESSFUL. INTEGRATE. I THINK IT IS MORE APPROPRIATE TO BE SPEAKING ENGLISH. YES. ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO DO, AND I FEEL STRONGLY, IT IS A COUNTRY BASED ON BORDERS AND OUR COUNTRIES BASED ON LAWS. WHEN PEOPLE COME INTO THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW THAT. THIS IS NOT FROM SOUTH AMERICA, THIS IS NOT FROM MEXICO. IT IS ALL OVER THE WORLD. WHEN PEOPLE COME A LEGALLY, WE CANNOT ALLOW THAT. I WANT PEOPLE TO COME LEGALLY. I WANT VERY MUCH TO TAKE CARE OF OUR BORDER BECAUSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER IS A TOTAL MESS. THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN. INTERESTINGLY, A COUPLE MONTHS AGO WHEN I ANNOUNCE, I MADE STRONG STATEMENTS ABOUT THE PRIME -- THE CRIME AND THE PROBLEMS HAPPENING. I HAVE BEEN PROVEN RIGHT AND MANY PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE HAVE ACTUALLY APOLOGIZED TO ME, WHICH I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. THEY HAVE NOT DONE IT PUBLICLY BUT THESE ARE MINOR DETAILS IN ONE DAY THEY WILL. THE FACT IS WE ARE A NATION THAT WANTS AND NEEDS ORDERS. WE ARE A NATION THAT WANTS AND NEEDS AND IS BASED ON LAWS. WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT TAKES PLACE. WITH THAT BEING SAID, I WANT PEOPLE TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY LEGALLY. I WANT TO HAVE A BIG, FAT, BEAUTIFUL OPEN-DOOR PARADIGM WANT PEOPLE OF GREAT TALENT TO COME IN, FOR SILICON VALLEY. I WANT ENGINEERS AND PHYSICISTS. I WANT PEOPLE WITH GREAT TALENT TO COME INTO THE UNITED STATES. WHEN PEOPLE GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE, YOU CAN BE NUMBER ONE FROM YOUR CLASSIC HARVARD, OR NUMBER ONE AT YELL, OR THE SCHOOL OF FINANCE, OR PRINCETON, OR STANFORD. IMMEDIATELY, IF YOU'RE NOT A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU GET THROWN OUT OF THE COUNTRY. WE WANT THOSE PEOPLE TO STAY. WE WANT PEOPLE OF GREAT TALENT TO BE IN THE UNITED STATES, TO WORK HERE, AND ULTIMATELY TO BECOME CITIZENS. I DO NOT KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT TO COMMENT. WHAT SHE JAILED? I DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT. GO AHEAD. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE. I WIN AT GOLF, THAT, I CAN TELL YOU. YES? WELL, I UNDERSTAND HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS MAY BE BETTER THAN ANYBODY. I UNDERSTAND THE POLITICAL SYSTEM AND ALSO VERY MUCH A SYSTEM OF COMING IN FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. DO NOT FORGET, IF I DID NOT BRING UP THE SUBJECT OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, YOU WOULD NOT BE ASKING THE QUESTION OR NO ONE WOULD EVEN BE TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION. IMMIGRATION AND IN PARTICULAR IT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, HAS BECOME A BIG FACTOR. A LOT OF BAD THINGS HAVE HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO CRIME SINCE I BROUGHT IT UP. BUT IF I DID NOT BRING IT UP, IMMIGRATION WOULD NOT EVEN BE A SUBJECT THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AND IT HAPPENS TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT SUBJECT. I HAVE TO SAY THIS. IT CAN ALSO BE A VERY POSITIVE SUBJECT. BECAUSE I BELIEVE SO STRONGLY IN IMMIGRATION. WE HAVE TO STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND WE HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO GREAT IMMIGRATION DONE IN A LEGAL MANNER. IF I DID NOT BRING IT UP, NOBODY WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT IT. GO AHEAD. >>   THERE IS GRIDLOCK IN CONGRESS RIGHT NOW AND THAT IS BECAUSE THERE IS NO LEADERSHIP AT THE TOP. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO LEAD YOU HAVE TO GET PEOPLE INTO YOUR OFFICE, GO TO THEM, ANYWAY YOU WANT TO DO IT. BUT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE. THERE IS NO LEADERSHIP AT THE TOP AND SIGNING EXECUTIVE ORDERS IS NOT THE WAY OUR COUNTRY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE RUN. GO AHEAD. >>   I DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT HERE. IT IS INAPPROPRIATE. YES, SIR, GO AHEAD. TOM BRADY? , RADIO IS A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE. HE IS A GREAT EYE, AN HONORABLE AND HONEST GUY AND A TRULY GREAT ATHLETE. HE IS REALLY A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE AND I JUST SPOKE TO HIM A LITTLE WHILE AGO AND HE IS SO THRILLED AND HAPPY. TOM BRADY, I THINK WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS TERRIBLE. HE HAS BEEN EXONERATED -- EXONERATED AS I UNDERSTAND IT, BECAUSE I JUST HEARD ABOUT IT. I'M VERY HAPPY FOR TOM. THEY ARE HAVING A ROUGH YEAR, LET'S FACE IT. GO AHEAD. IN EUROPE, THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS. PEOPLE GOING IN AND STORMING. IT IS A HUGE HUMANITARIAN PROBLEM. I WILL JUST SAY THIS. THE UNITED STATES HAS TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS OF THEIR OWN. WE HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE TWO FIXED OR BRIDGES AND ROADS AND EVERYTHING IS FALLING APART. OUR NATION IS IN SUCH TROUBLE. THAT IS WHY BEING A BUILDER AND A GREAT AND SUCCESSFUL BUILDER, I THINK WILL GREATLY HELP. WE HAVE SO MANY OF OUR OWN PROBLEMS, INCLUDING THE BUILDER -- INCLUDING THE WALL, WHICH WE WILL GET BUILT. HELPED -- HEALTH CARE IS A MESS. LOOK AT OBAMACARE. PREMIUMS HAVE GONE UP 55%. PEOPLE ARE SAYING, THIS IS TURNING OUT TO BE A DISASTER. DEDUCTIBLES ARE THROUGH THE ROOF . THE DEDUCTIBLES ON OBAMA CARE IS THROUGH THE ROOF. WE HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS HERE AND WE HAVE TO BUILD UP OUR MILITARY. JUST THE OTHER DAY, THE GENERAL SAID THE ARMY IS IN THE WORST SHAPE IN ITS HISTORY IN TERMS OF REPAIRED MISS. FOR THEM TO BE IN BAD SHAPE, WITH THE WAY WE ARE AND THE WORLD HATING US, YOU LOOK AT HILLARY CLINTON, AND I HAVE SAID, SHE IS THE WORST SECRETARY OF STATE IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. IN ALL FAIRNESS, BECAUSE OF THE AGREEMENT THAT IS ABOUT TO BE FINALIZED WITH IRAN, JOHN KERRY MAY VERY WELL TAKE HER PLACE. I THINK THAT AGREEMENT IS A DISASTER FOR THE COUNTRY, FOR ISRAEL, FOR THE MIDDLE EAST. IT WILL LEAD TO NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION. EVERYTHING ABOUT IT AND WE DO NOT EVEN GET OUR PRISONERS BACK. YOU SAY, WHO NEGOTIATES A THING LIKE THAT? THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN WITH A PRESIDENT TRUMP HERE AT ONE OR TWO MORE QUESTIONS. -- PRESIDENT TRUMP. ONE OR TWO MORE QUESTIONS. YES. YOU WILL SEE LATER. THEY DO NOT WANT TO HEAR IT. YES, GO AHEAD. COULD YOU STAND UP, PLEASE?  ALL I WANT THEM TO DO -- YES, AND SAY HELLO TO ROSEANN AND GREG. RATE PEOPLE. I WOULD SAY SIMPLY, I JUST WANT TO BE TREATED LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. I WAS A BIG CONTRIBUTOR. NO ONE KNOWS THE SYSTEM, BUT I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE AND I WAS THE ELITE AND I WAS THE FAIR-HAIRED PERSON. ONCE IRAN, I WAS A LITTLE BIT OF AN OUTSIDER. I BECAME AN OUTSIDER BECAUSE I WAS RUNNING AND I WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO RUN P OR DIME A BUSINESSMAN AND PEOPLE GIVE ME GREAT CREDIT AS BEING A GREAT BUSINESSMAN BUT I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE RUNNING FOR OFFICE. THE FACT IS OUR COUNTRIES BEING KILLED ON TRADE BY CHINA, BY JAPAN, BY MEXICO. I AM NOT KNOCKING THOSE COUNTRIES. THEIR LEADERS ARE MUCH MUCH SMARTER THAN OUR LEADERS. THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY KILLING US. CHINA, TAKING OUR JOBS, TAKING OUR MONEY, TAKING OUR BASE. THINK OF THIS. WE OH CHINA $1.4 TRILLION. AND WE ARE PAYING THEM INTEREST. WE ALL JAPAN, WITH ALL THE CARS COMING IN, THE SAME AMOUNT. $1.4 TRILLION. IT IS LIKE A MAGIC ACT. THEY SEND THE CARS IN, TAKE OUR JOBS, THEY DO EVERYTHING AND WE OH THEM MONEY. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN WITH ME. IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME. GO. WELL, JEB BUSH IS A VERY NICE MAN. I WILL BE HONEST I THINK HE IS A NICE PERSON. I THINK HE IS A VERY LOW ENERGY PERSON AND I DO NOT THINK THAT IS WHAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO I HEAR HE WILL SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON NEGATIVE ADVERTISEMENTS ON ME. HONESTLY, LOOK, HE'S GETTING THE MONEY FROM SPECIAL INTERESTS. HE IS GETTING THE MONEY FROM LOBBYISTS AND HIS DONORS. AND THEY ARE MAKING HIM DO IT BECAUSE HE IS CRASHING IN THE POLLS. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN. IF YOU SPENT $20 MILLION OR $25 MILLION ON NEGATIVE ADS, I DO NOT KNOW. I KNOW MY LIFE WILL CONTINUE. I JUST DO NOT KNOW. HE PROBABLY HAS TO DO THAT, ALTHOUGH IT WOULD NOT BE THE WAY I HAVE DONE IT. ONE OF THE THINGS I AM MOST HONORED ABOUT IS THAT SO FAR, EVERYBODY THAT HAS ATTACKED ME HAS GONE DOWN THE TUBES. YOU HAVE LINDSEY GRAHAM ATTACKING ME P WAS AT 3% AND HE IS NOW AT ZERO. YOU HAVE PERRY ATTACKING ME AND NOW HE IS OUT OF THE RACE. HE IS AT ZERO. RAND PAUL ATTACKED ME. RAND PAUL IS DOWN TO LESS THAN 2% AND HE ATTACKED ME. JEB BUSH ALSO WENT DOWN, VERY BIG. I DON'T KNOW. HE'S GOING TO SPEND LOBBYIST MONEY AND SPECIAL INTEREST MONEY. REMEMBER THIS. THEY HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER JEB AND HILLARY AND EVERYBODY ELSE WHO TAKE THAT MONEY. NOBODY KNOWS THE SYSTEM BETTER THAN ME. THEY HAVE TOTAL CONTROL. YOU UNDERSTAND IT VERY WELL BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN COVERING IT FOR A LONG TIME. THOSE PEOPLE PUTTING UP THOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER YOUR CANDIDATE. I WILL TELL YOU THIS. NOBODY IS PUTTING UP MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR ME. I'M PUTTING UP MY OWN MONEY.   IN FACT, I FEEL A LITTLE FOOLISH. PEOPLE ARE OFFERING ME MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS CARE WHEN YOU ARE IN FIRST PLACE, YOU CAN COLLECT SO MUCH MONEY. I KEEP TURNING THEM DOWN. I FEEL LIKE, AM I A FOOL? I FEEL VERY FOOLISH. WHEN I WAS IN IOWA LAST WEEK, I SAID, WHAT DO YOU THINK? A BIG LOBBYISTS OFFERED ME $5 MILLION FOR MY CAMPAIGN. I SAID TO THE CROWD IN IOWA, A GREAT CROWD OF 4000 PEOPLE, I SAID, CAN I TAKE IT, AND WHAT YOU BELIEVE, I WILL NOT DO ANYTHING, I PROMISE YOU AND'S READY YOU, WHEN I DO ANYTHING. THEY ALL STOOD UP AND SAID, NO, NO, DO NOT TAKE IT. I AM THE ONLY SELF FUNDER, I AM PUTTING UP MY OWN MONEY. THERE HAVE BEEN FIVE OR SIX SUPER PAC'S WHERE PEOPLE ARE FORMING SUPER PAC'S FOR TRUMP. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO AT THEM. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WILL DO IT HOPEFULLY, IF THEY DO SOMETHING, IT WILL BE NICE. I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM ARE IN A NUTSHELL, I AM FUNDING MY OWN CAMPAIGN AND NO ONE ELSE'S. WHEN PEOPLE ADVERTISE, AND I HOPE THE VOTERS CAN SEE THIS, EVERY NEGATIVE ADVERTISEMENT THEY SEE ABOUT ME IS PAID FOR BY LOBBYISTS AND SPECIAL INTERESTS. REMEMBER THAT. GO AHEAD.  OUR COUNTRY COULD BE DOING MUCH BETTER. ALL BAD TRADE AGREEMENTS. AN ARMY THAT IS NOT PREPARED. WE HAVE A MILITARY THAT NEEDS HELP, ESPECIALLY IN THESE TIMES SPIRIT WE HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT, YOU LOOK AT 60 MINUTES, THEY DO NOT EVEN WORK, OK? THE PHONES DO NOT WORK. THEY ARE 40 YEARS OLD. THEY HAVE WIRES THAT ARE NO GOOD HERE NOTHING WORKS. OUR COUNTRY DOES NOT WORK. EVERYBODY WINS EXCEPT US. WE NEED VICTORIES IN THE COUNTRY. WE DO NOT HAVE VICTORIES ANYMORE. OUR COUNTRY WILL BE GREAT AGAIN, BUT RIGHT NOW, THE COUNTRY HAS MAJOR PROBLEMS.  YES, CARLY. I WAS IN FAVOR OF HER BEING IN THE DEBATE. I THINK SHE SHOULD BE. I DO NOT LIKE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE 11 PEOPLE NOW AS I UNDERSTAND IT. THEY'RE NOT GETTING RID OF RAND PAUL OR SOMEBODY. THEY SHOULD BECAUSE IT IS TOO MANY PEOPLE. WHEN YOU HAVE A 11, YOU WILL NOT HEAR ME OR OTHER PEOPLE TALKING, AND I THINK THAT IS TOO BAD. I THINK 11 IS A LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT I WAS VERY HAPPY SHE GOT INTO THE DEBATE. QUITE FRANKLY, SHE DESERVES TO BE IN THE DEBATE. >>   I LIKE MAYBE HE IS INCLINED NOT TO GET INTO THE RACE. I THINK IT WILL DEPEND ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH HILLARY CLINTON. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK SHE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE IT LEGALLY FROM A CRIMINAL STANDPOINT TO THE STARTING GATE. I DO NOT KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE. I THINK IT DEPENDS ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH HER. I THINK IF SHE GETS OUT, HE WILL GET IN. IF SHE STAYS IN, HE MIGHT NOT. WHO KNOWS? >>   HE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. HE WAS HERE. HE WAS UP IN MY OFFICE. HE GOT THE PLEDGE AND WE ARE VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT. I TOLD HIM, I SAID, I DO NOT THINK IF -- I DO NOT THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO BE HERE. YOU GUYS WILL END UP SAYING HE IS ENDORSING TRUMP. THAT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR HIM. I WOULD SUGGEST, FRANKLY, I AM FINE WITH HIM NOT BEING HERE. I DO NOT WANT ANYONE TO THINK HE IS ENDORSING. AS FAR AS JEB IS CONCERNED, I WATCHED HIM THIS MORNING ON TELEVISION AND IT IS A LITTLE BIT THAT. DON'T FORGET, HE WAS SUPPOSED TO WIN. AND HE JUST DOES NOT HAVE THE ENERGY. WHAT HE DOES HAVE IS A LOT OF MONEY, GIVEN TO HIM BY SPECIAL INTERESTS, DONORS, AND LOBBYIST. I JUST HOPE IF HE SPENDS MONEY ON ADVERTISEMENTS, WHICH HE MIGHT NOT. I WOULD SPEND MONEY ON POSITIVE ADS ABOUT HIMSELF. IF HE KNOCKS ME, A SEMI-PEOPLE LEAVE, AND MAYBE THEY ARE AT A POINT WHERE THEY WILL NOT LEAVE BECAUSE THEY ARE FED UP WITH THIS COUNTRY, BUT I THINK THEY WILL GO TO PEOPLE OTHER THAN JEB . GO AHEAD. >>   I DON'T KNOW. I NOW, -- RIGHT NOW, I AM INTERESTED IN JOBS. ONE, ON CNN, I SHOULD NOT SAY THAT, BUT THEY DID A POLL. NUMBER ONE ON THE ECONOMY, NUMBER ONE ON JOBS PRODUCING. I MEAN NUMBER ONE BY MANY TIMES. I AM SO INTENT ON PUTTING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE 93 MILLION PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT IN THE WORKFORCE RIGHT NOW. 93 MILLION. WHEN THEY GIVE UP LOOKING FOR A JOB, THEY TAKE HIM OFF THE STATS. THEY TAKE HIM OFF THE STATISTICS. WE HAVE 93 MILLION PEOPLE. WE HAVE 50 MILLION PEOPLE BETWEEN POVERTY LEVELS AND WELFARE AND OUR COUNTRY CAN BE GREAT AGAIN TO WE HAVE TO PUT PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. ONE OR TWO MORE.  OK. WHAT I BRING MY CHILDREN INTO THE ADMINISTRATION? THEY ARE VERY CAPABLE. THE ANSWER IS PROBABLY NOT. THE SECOND PART IS NO LONGER PERTINENT. BACK THERE, GO AHEAD. KANYE WEST, I WILL NEVER SAY BAD ABOUT HIM. YOU KNOW WHY? HE LOVES TRUMP. HE GOES AROUND SAYING, TRUMP IS MY ALL-TIME HERO. HE SAYS IT TO EVERYBODY. KANYE WEST, I LOVE HIM. MAYBE IN A FEW YEARS, I WILL HAVE TO RUN AGAINST HIM. HE HAS BEEN SO NICE TO ME. YOU PEOPLE HAVE SEEN BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN A COUNTERPUNCH OR PEER AND I HIT PEOPLE WHEN THEY HIT ME, ONLY. AND KANYE WEST HAS BEEN SO GREAT. I WOULD NEVER SAY BAD ABOUT HIM BECAUSE HE SAYS SUCH NICE THINGS ABOUT ME.  NO, MY SUPPORTERS ARE REALLY SUPPORTING ME BECAUSE I AM VERY COMPETENT. THEY KNOW I WILL NOT LET CHINA RIP US OFF. I WILL NOT LET JAPAN RIP US OFF. JAPAN IS DEVALUING THE YEN, VERY HARD FOR CATERPILLAR AND OTHER COMPANIES TO COMPETE AGAINST THEIR BIG TRACTOR MAKER. WE WILL NOT LET THIS HAPPEN ANYMORE. YOU TALK ABOUT A TRADE IMBALANCE. THEY HAVE, IN JAPAN, THE BIGGEST SHIPS YOU HAVE EVER SEEN POURING CARS INTO LOS ANGELES. POURING THE MEN. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. IT'S GOING TO AND, AND ARE GOING TO LIKE US. IT'S A BANK FROM CHINA, THE BIGGEST BANK IN THE WORLD. I GET ALONG GREAT WITH CHINA. I GET ALONG GREAT WITH JAPAN. I GET ALONG GREAT WITH MEXICO. I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF MEXICO, I LOVE THE HISPANICS. I HAVE THOUSANDS OF HISPANICS RIGHT NOW WORKING FOR ME. OVER THE YEARS I HAVE EMPLOYED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HISPANICS, MANY FOR MEXICO. I HAVE UNBELIEVABLY GREAT RELATIONSHIPS AND IN THE PACKAGE WE GAVE YOU, YOU WILL SEE THERE IS A POLL. . I'M NUMBER ONE WITH HISPANICS. NUMBER ONE WITH HISPANICS. FOR OUR COUNTRY TO BE GREAT, WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE GREAT DEALS. WE ARE GOING TO BE GREAT TO THE VETS. OUR MILITARIES GABBY UNBELIEVABLE. WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE AND COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS MUCH BETTER AND LESS EXPENSIVE. WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL IT. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OUT A LONG TIME BUT SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR COUNTRY AND BRING BACK JOBS AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK WEALTH TO THE UNITED STATES SO WE CAN AFFORD TO SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY, WHICH I WILL SAVE WITHOUT CUTS, SO WE CAN AFFORD TO DO THE KIND OF THINGS WE HAVE TO DO TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HERE IS YOUR PLEDGE.  SOMEBODY ELSE WROTE IT. IT'S A BUBBLE WAITING TO EXPLODE. I HAVE BEEN SAYING WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN CHINA IS A BUBBLE WAITING TO EXPLODE AND GESTURE MEMBERS SOMETHING, WHEN IT'S A BUBBLE, WE CAN'T BE BROUGHT DOWN BY THAT BUBBLE. THEY'VE DONE THINGS THAT CAUSED IT. WE CAN'T BE BROUGHT DOWN BY THAT BUBBLE. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU.  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS IS AN AMAZING MAN. HE IS THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF INDONESIA. HE'S HERE TO SEE ME. ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MAN AND A GREAT MAN AND HIS WHOLE GROUP IS HERE TO SEE ME TODAY AND WE WILL DO GREAT THINGS FOR THE UNITED STATES. IS THAT CORRECT?  DO THEY LIKE ME IN INDONESIA?

I WILL TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT NASHVILLE. IT IS A SPECIAL PLACE TO ME FOR A SPECIAL REASON. MAYBE MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE WOMAN WITH US. SHE IS 92 YEARS OLD. WE DO NOT TALK ABOUT AGE, BUT SHE IS 92. SHE LOOKS MAGNIFICENT. SHE HAS BECOME VERY FAMOUS. WHERE ARE YOU? LOOK AT HER. SO BEAUTIFUL. SHE JUST REGISTERED TO VOTE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE. SHE HAS NOT SEEN ANYBODY THAT REALLY DID IT TO HER, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE, SHE JUST REGISTERED TO VOTE AND SHE IS GOING TO VOTE FOR TRUMP, I THINK. RIGHT? THANK YOU, DARLING. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. SHE IS ON TELEVISION ALL OVER THE WORLD NOW. I HAVE TO BE NERVOUS EVEN TALKING TO HER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT, HONEY. AND EVERYBODY APPRECIATES IT. THERE IS A BIG, GROWING, LIKE LEAPS AND BOUNDS, SILENT MAJORITY OUT THERE, AND WE WILL TAKE THIS COUNTRY BACK AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY SO GREAT AGAIN AND SO STRONG AGAIN. I HAVE TO TELL YOU. SIT DOWN, FOLKS, AND JOY. ENOUGH WITH THE STANDING UP HERE LOOK AT THIS GROUP. WHAT A GROUP. THE ALL-TIME RECORD, THEY TURNED AWAY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, I HEAR. THESE PEOPLE HAVE THE BEST REAL ESTATE, RIGHT? I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU. SO YEARS AGO, MANY YEARS AGO, I HATE TO SAY 40 -- I WILL NOT SAY 40. BUT CLOSE TO 40. I CAME TO NASHVILLE. THE YOU EVER HEAR OF A COMPANY -- THEY WERE BASED IN NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, AND THEY OWNED THE DEPARTMENT STORE. AND I WAS A YOUNG GUY AND I CAME FROM BROOKLYN AND CLEAN -- AND QUEENS AND I WENT INTO MANHATTAN AND I DID THE HOTEL AND SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WERE GOOD. THE THING I WANTED MORE THAN ANYTHING WAS 5TH AVENUE BETWEEN 57TH AND 56TH STREET, THE TIFFANY LOCATION RIGHT NEXT TO TIFFANY. THAT IS WHAT I WANTED. I WANTED THAT PIECE OF PROPERLY DEAF PROPERTY SO BADLY. YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO WANT THINGS THAT BADLY BECAUSE GOD WILL GET ANGRY AT ME, RIGHT? BUT I WANTED IT SO BADLY. IT WAS BASED IN TENNESSEE. I CAME IN AND I CAME TO NASHVILLE. I MET WITH THE HEADS OF GENESCO, WHO WERE VERY GREAT PEOPLE, ACTUALLY. THEY WERE HAVING A LOT OF DIFFICULTIES. A LOT OF FIGHTING AND EVERYTHING. I CONVINCED THEM TO SELL ME THE LAND. AND THE BUILDING. I BOUGHT FIFTH AVENUE FROM 57 TO 56TH STREETS, SURROUNDING, I BOUGHT THE RIGHTS FROM TIFFANY, I BOUGHT -- BUILT THE TRUMP TOWER, AND IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT BILLINGS OF THE WORLD AND GREAT SUCCESSES. I WENT TO -- WHEN I WAS HERE. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. WHEN YOU ARE LEADING IN EVERY POLL, THEY SORT OF WANT YOU TO WHEN YOU ARE NOT LEADING IN THE POLLS LIKE SO MANY OF THESE GUYS, THEY DO NOT WANT YOU AT ALL. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE POLLS IN A SECOND. BUT I HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES THIS MORNING AND I COULD'VE ALSO GONE AND PLAYED GOLF LIKE THE PRESIDENT DOES ALL THE TIME, RIGHT? BUT I DECIDED, LET'S DO THIS. I REALLY CHOSE NASHVILLE BECAUSE HEY, THE EXPERIENCE IS NOT MY BIGGEST DEAL, BUT IN TERMS OF A DEAL, IT IS SO IMPORTANT, AND IT HAS BEEN SUCH A GREAT -- FROM THE DAY I BUILD IT, IT WAS A HOME RUN. IT ALL REALLY TOOK PLACE BECAUSE OF NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU FOLKS, I CAN TELL YOU. A REAL HONOR.  SO, COMING OVER, I WATCH TELEVISION, AND YOU KNOW THEY HAVE ALL THESE CAMERAS BACK THERE AND THEY ARE ALIVE AND I GUESS WE ARE LIVE ON CNN AND SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. IT IS A DIFFICULT WHEN EURO'S LIFE. YOU HAVE GOT TO CHANGE UP YOUR SPEECH. YOU CANNOT MAKE THE SAME SPEECH OVER AND OVER. SOME OF THE FOLKS IN THE ROOM KNOW THAT. OTHER CANDIDATES DO NOT GET COVERED LIVE EVER EXCEPT FOR THE DEBATE. SO YOU KNOW, THEY HAD 24 MILLION PEOPLE ON THE DEBATE ARE NOW THEY THINK WHEN A NEW NUMBERS COME OUT, THEY WILL BE EVEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN THAT. I WOULD HAVE SAID THEY WOULD'VE HAD ONE MILLION OR TWO. I SAID THEY HAD 24 MILLION PEOPLE ARE NOW THE SECOND DEBATE, ON CNN, THAT WAS ON FOX, MAYBE I SHOULD ASK FOR A LOT OF MONEY AND GIVE THE MONEY FOR CHARITY. ALL TO CHARITY. I SAID THAT TO THE WRITERS OF TIME MAGAZINE. THEY WERE NICE ENOUGH TO PUT ME ON THE COVER WITH A NICE STORY. AND I SORT OF THOUGHT I SET IT OFF THE RECORD BUT THEY PUT IT IN TIME MAGAZINE. SO SHOULD I ASK FOR CHARITY? MAYBE A NICE NASHVILLE CHARITY AND AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY, AND AIDS RESEARCH AND THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD THINGS. ALZHEIMER'S, SO MANY BIG RINGS GOING ON THERE. MAYBE I SHOULD ASK FOR A LOT OF MONEY, SO THEY WILL GET SAY 2 MILLION PEOPLE THEY DO NOT DO GREAT, ESPECIALLY, YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION -- FLIES. THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST SHOWS IN THE HISTORY OF CABLE TELEVISION IN TERMS OF CLINICAL. IN THE HISTORY OF CABLE TELEVISION. IN ALL FAIRNESS, I SHOULD.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS, I THINK I MIGHT ASK FOR A LOT OF MONEY TO CHARITY. BUT, YOU KNOW, I DID SAY WHAT DO YOU THINK, SHOULD I DO IT OR NOT? MAYBE NOT, I DON'T KNOW.  HERE'S THE THING, IF I DON'T DO IT, CNN WILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. THEY ARE ACTUALLY VERY NICE, BUT THEY WILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT IS SOMETHING TO CONSIDER. WE WILL ALL CONSIDER IT. I SAW THAT THEY WERE HAVING THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COME IN, TIME TO DO WITH CHILDREN, THE DREAMERS. THE JAYS OF CHILDREN. I SAID, WHAT ABOUT OUR CHILDREN, WHY CAN'T OUR CHILDREN BE THE DREAMERS? NO ONE EVER TALKS ABOUT THAT.  THEY NEVER TALK ABOUT THAT. WE TALK ABOUT THE DREAMERS, WHO BY THE WAY ARE TREATED BETTER THAN OUR VETS. OUR VETS ARE INCREDIBLE. IMMIGRANTS, IN MANY CASES, NOT IN ALL CASES, BUT IN MANY CASES -- AND OUR VETERANS, OUR WOUNDED WARRIORS, THESE ARE THE GREATEST PEOPLE WE HAVE. AND ANOTHER THING NICE ABOUT BEING ABLE TO MAKE SPEECHES WITHOUT HAVING TO HIRE SOME GUY TO WRITE IT AND KEEP WRITING, AND THEN SAY, GOOD MORNING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, NASHVILLE'S WONDERFUL"","" YOU KNOW, I CAN TALK ABOUT THIS MORNING, HOW PEOPLE ARE WAITING ON LINE TO GET IN. THESE ARE OUR VETERANS WHO GOT HURT. MAYBE THEY WOULD NOT BE -- WE WOULD NOT BE HERE IF IT WAS NOT FOR THEM. THAT IS'S WILL. THEY HAD A STORY THIS MORNING ON FOX AND CNN AND A NUMBER OF THEM, WHERE THE VETERANS ARE TREATED TERRIBLY. THEY SHOW THE DESK WHERE THERE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PEOPLE BEHIND THE DESK. THEY SHOW A DESK AND THERE IS NO ONE THERE. PROBABLY SOME OF YOU SAW IT. THE VETERANS ARE SAYING, WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE, AND THEY SAY WHAT HAPPENED, AND THEY SAY, THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. NO ONE IS EVEN THERE. AND TO A CIGAR WEDNESDAY, THEY HAVE THE LONGEST WAIT IN THE HISTORY, IN THE HISTORY OF THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION, FOR PEOPLE WANTING TO SEE A DOCTOR. IF I GO TO A DOCTOR, AND I HAD TO WAIT NINE MINUTES, I AM LIKE, I GO CRAZY. IT IS TRUE. REMEMBER THE OLD DAYS WHEN THE DOCTORS USED TO COME TO YOUR HOUSE? PETER REMEMBERS THAT. YOU HAVE A CALL ON THE DOCTOR WOULD CARRY A LITTLE BAG LIKE THIS TAKE, AND HE WOULD COME OVER TO YOUR HOUSE, CHECK YOU OUT, THOSE DO NOT EXIST ANYMORE. WE ARE IN THE AGE OF OBAMA CARE, WHERE NOTHING EXISTS. WE WILL REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE. THAT, I CAN TELL YOU.  BUT, TWO LISA GO WEDNESDAY, THE LONGEST WAIT -- TWO WEEKS AGO WEDNESDAY, THE LONGEST WAIT IN THE HISTORY. IF YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE, MEN AND WOMEN ARE A WAITING FOR DAYS, THREE DAYS, ONE WAS FIVE DAYS. ONE WAS FIVE OR SIX DAYS, FINALLY GOT TO SEE THE DOCTOR AND A DOCTOR EXCUSE HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS GOING ON VACATION. CAN YOU IMAGINE WAITING EVEN A DAY OR A HALF-DAY? THESE PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR FIVE DAYS. THE WEIGHTS ARE THE LONGEST IN HISTORY. THAT IS THE WAY WE ARE TREATING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE WILL CHANGE THAT. WE HAVE RIGHT NOW, AND YOU SEE THESE PHONY STATISTICS PUT OUT BY POLITICIANS, BASICALLY, ALL TALK AND NO ACTION POLITICIANS. ON BOTH SIDES IN ALL FAIRNESS. YOU KNOW, I'M A REPUBLICAN AND I AM A CONSERVATIVE, BUT I'M JUST AS ANGER WITH THE REPUBLICANS. WHEN YOU GO TO WASHINGTON, SOMETHING HAPPENS. THEY BECOME WEAK. THEY GO TO WASHINGTON. ""WE ARE GOING TO STOP OBAMACARE, WE WILL DO THIS AND THAT."" THEN THEY GO IN THERE AND THEY GO, OH, I MADE IT, DARLING, I MADE IT TO A VOTE FOR YOU. I VOTE FOR YOU. I VOTE FOR OBAMACARE EXTENSIONS. I WILL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT ME TO DO, I'M IN WASHINGTON."" IT IS AMAZING. ISN'T IT AMAZING QUESTION MARK DON'T YOU AGREE? IT WON'T HAPPEN TO ME, I PROMISE. AND IF IT DOES, YOU'RE GOING TO LET ME KNOW ABOUT IT. BUT IT WON'T. I PROMISE. THEY SHOW THOSE PHONY STATISTICS WHERE WE ARE 5.4% UNEMPLOYMENT. THE REAL NUMBER, I SAW A NUMBER THAT COULD BE 42%, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. WE HAVE 93 MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE. OF THE 93, MANY OF THESE PEOPLE WANT JOBS. THEY QUIT LOOKING. SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A JOB AND YOU CANNOT FIND IT, AND YOU STOP FOR A WHILE, AFTER A WHILE, YOU ARE LIKE, IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BUT THEY STAFF THEY ARE EMPLOYED. WE HAVE 93 MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE. IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE. WE HAVE 50 MILLION PEOPLE IN POVERTY. CHINA IS TAKING OUR MONEY. JAPAN IS TAKING OUR MONEY. YOU JUST LOST A BIG CAR PLANTS TO MEXICO IN TENNESSEE. FRONTPAGE, ""WALL STREET JOURNAL"" -- I LOVE THIS GUY. I LOVE THIS GUY. HE'S JUST HOLDING THIS SIGN UP. LOOK AT HIM. I KNOW HE'S VOTING FOR. THIS IS A MOVEMENT. THIS IS A MOVEMENT -- I DON'T WANT IT TO BE ABOUT ME. THIS IS ABOUT COMMON THAN, THIS IS ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT THING. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME OUT IN THE POLL THAT WAS REALLY AMAZING -- IN IOWA, WE ARE LEADING DAY -- THOSE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. WE HAD SUCH AN AMAZING EVENING. IT WAS A HAPPENING. WE JUST LEFT ALABAMA, WHICH WAS UNBELIEVABLE. 31,000 PEOPLE IN A STADIUM AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO FOR -- IT WAS SUPPOSED TO POUR. THE POLLS JUST CAME OUT IN ALABAMA -- LEADING BIG IN ALABAMA, LEADING BIG IN IOWA. LEADING TREMENDOUSLY BIG IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, LEADING REALLY BIG IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. LEADING BIG IN FLORIDA. I HAVE A GOVERNOR -- WE HAVE A LOW ENERGY GOVERNOR AND WE HAVE A SENATOR, AND WE ARE LEADING BIG IN FLORIDA. HOW DO YOU DO THAT? YOU HAVE A SENATOR WHO IS SITTING AND -- I LOVE FLORIDA AND I'M THERE A LOT, GREAT WEATHER. YOU HAVE GREAT WEATHER BUT FLORIDA HAS GREAT WEATHER. BIG ADVANTAGE. I'M LEADING BIG IN FLORIDA, BUT ONE OF THE POLLS CAME OUT. SOUTH CAROLINA AND NORTH CAROLINA, I'M LEADING REALLY BIG. IN SOUTH CAROLINA, A POLL CAME OUT AND WE HAD A STATEMENT THAT MY LEVEL OF POPULARITY OR FAVORABLE -- I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN GET A POLL. I HAD ONE POLL WHERE I THINK I'M 41%. 41%. WITH 17 PEOPLE. BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE HIM. I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT INNS THESE POLLS AND I GET NEGATIVE PUBLICITY. THE PRESS -- IT'S TERRIBLE. YESTERDAY, YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN ME. I WAS IN SOUTH CAROLINA. THE NEW YORK TIMES, VERY LIBERAL PAPER -- NOT EVERYONE CAN BE LIKE US, BUT IT IS STILL THE ""NEW YORK TIMES. I'M ON THE FRONT PAGE A LOT. THEY HAD A STORY ABOUT ME AND THEY HAD SOME LOW LEVEL HISPANIC COMMENTATOR. I THINK I'M GOING TO WIN HISPANIC VOTE. IN A VAT, I WON THE HISPANIC VOTE. I LOVE THE HISPANIC PEOPLE. INCREDIBLE ENERGY, INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. I HAVE THOUSANDS THAT WORK FOR ME AND THOUSANDS OF THOUSANDS OVER THE YEARS HAVE WORKED FOR ME. THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE AND I SAID I'M GOING TO WIN AND A LOT OF HISPANICS HERE ILLEGALLY DON'T WANT PEOPLE COMING IN ILLEGALLY. IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. THIS PAUL COMES OUT, I THINK IN SOUTH CAROLINA, WHERE WE ARE WAY UP AND LINDSEY GRAHAM IS AT FOUR AND I'M AT 30. I WROTE HIM A NOTE, CONGRATULATIONS I'M BEATING YOU IN YOUR HOME STATE BY ONLY 26 POINTS. WHAT WHO CARES. THIS -- I THINK I'M A NICE PERSON AND I WANT TO HELP PEOPLE -- WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES TO ME ARE VERY IMPORTANT. TO JUMP BUSH IT WAS NOT IMPORTANT BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO FUND THEM AND THEN HE SAYS I MISSPOKE. I REALLY WANT TO BE A NICE PERSON AND I AM A NICE PERSON BUT IT'S GOING TO BE AN ELECTION TASTE ON COMPETENCE. WE ARE TIRED TEEING THE PATSIES FOR EVERYBODY. I THINK IT IS TIME. BUT IN THE POLL -- IN ANOTHER ACT OF POLITICAL MAGIC, TRUMP MANAGED TO FLIP HIS FAVORABILITY RATING FROM NEGATIVE -- NOBODY SAID IT, NOBODY REPORTED IT, FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE. I HAVE THIS PHOTOGRAPHIC WREATH -- I WANT TO BE SURE -- IF I USE A WORD INCORRECTLY -- FAVORABILITY RATING FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE IN ONE POLL DURING THE SPAN OF A MONTH -- A FEAT THAT A HIGHLY RESPECTED POLLSTER CALLED ASTOUNDING. NOBODY ELSE WROTE ABOUT IT. THAT DEFIES ANY RULE IN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS I'VE EVER SEEN SAID THIS HIGHLY RESPECTED MAN. HE FLIP IT FROM 20% TO 52% IN ONE MONTH AND HE SAID HE'S NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE HEARD THIS. THEY SAY I'VE MADE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. I HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. THAT'S THE KIND OF THINKING WE NEED IN THE COUNTRY. WHATEVER IT IS. BUT, TO ME, THAT STATEMENT WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN LITERALLY KILLING EVERYBODY IN THE POLLS. WE WERE MUCH HIGHER, MORE THAN DOUBLE EVERYBODY. YOU SAW BACK WHEN A P ACT JUST CAME OUT AND THAT WAS AN AMAZING POLL. MUCH, MUCH HIGHER. I WAS DOUBLE AND QUADRUPLE MANY OF THESE CANDIDATES. THE REASON IS PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE SMART. THEY DON'T BELIEVE A LOT OF WHAT THEY SEE IN THE MEDIA. WHY ARE THEY EVEN SAYING IT? YOU WOULD SAY IF SOMEONE IS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY -- I'M GOING TO BE GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO MAKE GREAT DEALS. OUR COUNTRY DOESN'T WIN ANYMORE. YOU WOULD THINK EVEN A LIBERAL PERSON OR A DEMOCRAT -- SOMEBODY IS GOING TO MAKE THE COUNTRY -- WHY DO THEY FIGHT MARK WOULD THINK THEY WOULD SAY LET'S DO IT , IT'S GOOD FOR ALL OF US. WE GO NOW 19 TRILLION. WHEN OBAMACARE KICKS IN, WHICH IS REALLY KICKING IN IN 16 -- YOU WANT TO SEE BAD DEFICITS? YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO SEE IT GO UP. THAT HAS A HUGE IMPACT NOT ONLY ON THE JOBS BUT THE DEFICIT ITSELF. YOU HAVE SEEN IT YOURSELF -- PREMIUMS HAVE GONE THROUGH THE ROOF, RIGHT? THE DEDUCTIBILITY, UNLESS YOU ARE CLOSE TO DEATH, YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO USE IT. IT IS SO HIGH. THE PREMIUMS ARE UP 30%, 40%, 50% AND MORE. IT IS A DISASTER AND IT'S GOING TO COST THE COUNTRY A FORTUNE. SO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING IMPORTANTLY ABOUT IT. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU -- I WON'T INCH AND NAMES, SOME OF THEM, WHEN THEY HEAR MY NAME -- WE HAVE A GREAT REPORTER TODAY FROM THE ""WALL STREET JOURNAL"" WHO CAME DOWN -- SHE SAID SOME OF THEM WHEN THEY HEAR YOUR NAME, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE READY TO EXPLODE. IT'S TRUE. NUMBER ONE, THEY LOOK BAD BECAUSE YOU REMEMBER THE BEGINNING -- THREE OR FOUR MONTH AGO, THEY WERE SAYING HE'S JUST HAVING FUN. I WENT TO A GREAT SCHOOL, I DID EVERYTHING THAT'S GREAT. I CAME OUT, I MADE A FORTUNE. I THEN DID A BOOK CALLED ""THE ART OF THE DEAL WAS QUOTE AND MANY BEST SELLERS. THAT ONE IS PROBABLY THE BEST-SELLING BUSINESS BOOK OF ALL TIMES. WHO IS RIGHT THAT? ALMOST EVERYBODY. I JOKINGLY SAY, BUT I NEEDED -- THE BIBLE TRUMPS IT BY A LONG WAY. I SAID IT IN IOWA, AND IT'S TRUE -- NOTHING TOPS OF THE BIBLE -- MANY BEST SELLERS AND THEN I DO ""THE APPRENTICE."" IT'S ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SHOWS EVER ON TELEVISION AND NBC RENEWED THE APPRENTICE. THEY CAME TO MY OFFICE, THE HEAD OF COMCAST, GREAT GUYS -- I WILL USE NAMES, I WILL JUST SAY STEVE -- SHE'S ONE OF THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY. HE CAME UP WITH THE HEADS OF NBC AND THEY SAID MONTHS AGO, THEY SAID, DONALD, WE ARE RENEWING THE APPRENTICE, YOU HAVE TO DO IT. I SAID HONESTLY, I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I WANT TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN. AND THEY DID NOT BELIEVE ME. I SAID IT FOUR TIMES. NOBODY BELIEVED I WAS GOING TO RUN. NOBODY. MY WIFE BELIEVE ME, BUT NOW SHE DOES. SHE SAID, IF YOU ARE GOING TO RUN, YOU ARE GOING TO DO GREAT BECAUSE PEOPLE LOVE YOU. SHE SAID THEY LOVE YOU BUT I DON'T WANT TO BRING -- I DON'T WANT TO BRAG. THANK YOU. IF YOU -- THE NBC GUYS COME UP -- TERRIFIC PEOPLE. I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH NBC FOR 12 YEARS. WE HAVE MANY NUMBER ONES AND ""THE APPRENTICE"" CONTINUES TO DO GREAT. THEY WANT TO RENEW IT #BURNETT CALLS UP -- HE SAYS I DON'T BELIEVE IT -- YOU ARE NOT TAKING A RENEWAL. I SAID THAT'S RIGHT, I'M GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. HE SAID NO BUT HE DOESN'T TAKE A WRITTEN WILL. IT IS UNHEARD OF -- PRIMETIME TELEVISION, TWO HOURS. ARE YOU CRAZY? I SAID, MARK, I'VE HAD TO DO THIS. WE CAN SAVE OUR COUNTRY. WE CAN SAVE OUR COUNTRY. SO NBC RENEWED IT. I TOLD THEM I'M NOT DOING IT AND THEY FINALLY BELIEVED ME WHEN I ACTUALLY ANNOUNCED. THEY DON'T LIKE ME ANYMORE. IT'S AMAZING. THAT'S TOO BAD. THANK YOU. THE FUNNY THING ABOUT THE APPRENTICE -- THERE HAVE BEEN IN COPIES. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM FAILED. SO A REPORTER SAID WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS? I SAID BECAUSE I'M SPECIAL. I WAS KIDDING. I SORT OF MEANT IT, TO BE HONEST, BUT I WAS SORT OF KIDDING AND THEY WROTE IT -- IT SOUNDS GOOD WHEN YOU SAY IT BUT IT LOOKS BAD IN WRITING. I HAD A GREAT EXPERIENCE, SO HERE I AM -- GREAT, GREAT BRAIN, GREAT SUCCESS, I FELT A GREAT COMPANY, DO THE APPRENTICE, TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. WHEN I DID THE APPRENTICE COME A CERTAIN CRITICS SAID IT WILL NEVER BE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE TO HAVE A BIG HIT, YOU REMEMBER THAT FIRST -- IT HAD ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATINGS EVER. REMEMBER HOW THAT WAS? TO HAVE A GREAT SUCCESS, YOU HAVE TO HAVE WOMEN. I SAVED THE ARTICLE -- LIKE HARRY TRUMAN SAVED IT -- IT SAID TRUMAN LOSES AND HE ACTUALLY ONE. IT SAID TRUMP CAN NEVER SUCCEED ON TELEVISION COUSIN WHY WOULD WOMEN WANT TO WATCH DONALD TRUMP? I SAID AM I SO BAD? AND IT TURNED OUT WOMEN WERE THE BIGGEST BASE. SO I SAVE THOSE THINGS. BUT, NO MATTER HOW YOU CUT IT, WE CAN DO SOMETHING SO INCREDIBLE. -- AND HONESTLY, IT'S GOING TO BE HARD AND IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF WORK. OBAMA ALWAYS LEAVES THE WHITE HOUSE. INC. OF IT -- YOU ARE ELECTED PRESIDENT -- WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO LEAVE? I THINK I WOULD NEVER LEAVE. HOW COOL IS THAT? HE LEAVES TO GO TO SOME PLACE AND GO FUNDRAISERS -- MAYBE THERE'S A RULE AGAINST IT -- I WOULD DO FUNDRAISERS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. HE AND HIS WIFE LEFT -- RIGHT NEXT DOOR IN BURBANK, CALIFORNIA, THEY LEFT A COUPLE OF HOURS DIFFERENT. ONE TOOK AIR FORCE ONE, ONE TOOK A BEAUTIFUL BOEING -- TWO DIFFERENT PLANES, GOING TO THE SAME LOCATION, GOING TO THE SAME AIRPORT TO DO DIFFERENT SHOWS AND I SAY WHY? WHY ARE NOT -- WHY AREN'T THEY FLYING ON THE SAME PLACE -- ON THE SAME PLANE. I KNOW HOW MUCH THOSE COSTS BECAUSE I HAVE ONE. MORE IMPORTANT, THE TIME AND ENERGY -- BUT I WOULD HAVE SAID ELEANOR WHOEVER IS DOING THE SHOW, LET'S DO IT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. I WON'T SPEND ANY MONEY FROM THE TAXPAYERS. THINK ABOUT IT. AND THE FUNNY THING, THE FUNNY THING IS WHOEVER THE HOST IS WOULD LIKE IT THAT ARE -- WE ARE DOING OUR SHOW LIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. WE DON'T PAY ANY MONEY, WE DON'T HAVE TO FUEL UP AIR FORCE ONE. DO YOU SEE WHAT IT COSTS TO TRAVEL IN THESE THINGS? YOUR CLOSING DOWN HER BANK CALIFORNIA. EVERY TIME OBAMA COMES TO MANHATTAN. WHAT'S GOING ON, YOU CAN'T MOVE? THEY'VE CLOSE DOWN THE CITY. HE COULD DO IT FROM WASHINGTON. HE COULD DO IT IN MY NEW HOTEL -- I'M BUILDING -- IT'S TRUE. I'M BUILDING AN INCREDIBLE HOTEL ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE FOR THE OLD POST OFFICE. I GOT IT FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. ONE OF THE MOST HEAVILY SOUGHT AFTER BUILDING IN THE HISTORY OF THE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION -- THEY OWNED IT AND THEY MADE THE DECISION. WE ARE BUILDING THIS BEAUTIFUL HOTEL DIRECTLY BETWEEN CONGRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE. IT IS GOING TO OPEN JUST IN TIME -- LISTEN TO THIS 1 -- WE ARE UNDER BUDGET AND AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. DO YOU EVER HEAR THAT FROM GOVERNMENT? IT WILL BE GREAT. COME IN, USE IT AND GO BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU SAY TO YOUR SELF -- IT'S A MINDSET. MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN THE TRAVEL, WE HAVE SO MANY THINGS WE HAVE TO DO -- YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE TIME. YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE DEALS. I'VE GOT THE GREATEST DEALMAKERS IN THE WORLD -- CARL ICAHN, AN INCREDIBLE GUY. GREAT DEALMAKER. I'VE GOT SOME OF THE BEST DEALMAKERS IN THE WORLD. THEY ARE ALL CALLING ME -- THE BEST IN THE WORLD. I KNOW THE BEST. I ALSO KNOW GUYS WHO ARE OVERRATED AND I KNOW GUYS YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF THAT ARE HONESTLY PHENOMENAL. I KNOW A LOT YOU HAVE HEARD OF THAT ARE OVERRATED. BUT I HAVE THE BEST IN THE WORLD. THEY DON'T WANT MONEY. THEY ARE WORTH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BUT WHEN I SAY CARL ICAHN, HANDLE CHINA. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A GREAT DEAL. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE BACK OUR TRADE. IF YOU LOOK AT CHINA, IF YOU LOOK GET JAPAN -- I WAS IN LOS ANGELES -- I SAW THE BIGGEST SHIPS I'VE EVER SEEN WITH CARS POURING OUT, ONE AFTER ANOTHER, MADE IN JAPAN. IT DOESN'T HELP US. WHERE DOES IT HELP US MARK WE SELL THEM BEEF. THEN THEY DON'T WANT IT -- DO YOU EVER SEE WHAT'S GOING ON? IT GOES OVER THERE AND IT'S PERISHABLE, SO BY THE TIME IT GETS OVER THERE, THEY TURN AROUND AND WE DON'T WANT IT AND THEY HAVE CARS COMING FROM THESE MASSIVE SHIPS AND THEY JUST POUR OFF THE SHIPS. HOW STUPID ARE WE? I LEAVE IN FREE TRADE. BUT I HAVE TO BE FAIR TRADE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT JAPAN, THEY TAKEN MONEY UP HERE AND WE GIVE THEM MONEY DOWN HERE. WE GIVE NOTHING -- IT'S PEANUTS. BALANCE IT OUT, FELLAS. YOU HAVE TO BALANCE IT. A FRIEND OF MINE IS A GREAT MANUFACTURER. CHINA -- IT'S PROBABLY THE GREATEST THEFT IN THE UNITED STATES. THEY'VE TAKEN OUR MONEY, THEY'VE TAKEN OUR JOBS, THEY HAVE TAKEN SO MUCH, AND THEY ARE CREATING A BUBBLE AND WE ARE SO INTERTWINED NOW THAT THE BUBBLE IS GOING TO EXPLODE. I'VE MADE SO MUCH MONEY DEALING WITH CHINA. I'VE MADE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS, PROBABLY ALIENS DEALING WITH CHINA. THE BANK OF AMERICA BUILDING IN SAN FRANCISCO, I OWN PART OF THAT -- PEOPLE SAY TRUMP IS ONLY WORTH $5 BILLION -- THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW MY NUMBERS. THEY SAY WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO LOOK AT ABOUT 400 OF HIS COMPANIES. THEY SAID HE WILL NEVER RUN. SO THEY SAY I WILL NEVER RUN. BUT I'M RUNNING. THEN I ANNOUNCED -- THEY SAY HE WILL NEVER FILE HIS FORM. THAT'S A SINGLE PAY WHERE YOU'RE SIGNING YOUR LIFE AWAY. IT HAS TO BE DONE WITHIN 14 DAYS. I SIGNED BY FORM. THEY SAID HE WILL NEVER FOOT IN HIS FINANCIALS. AND YOU HAVE LIKE 90 DAYS OR SOMETHING AND THEY SAID HE WILL ASK FOR EXTENSIONS BECAUSE HE'S PROBABLY NOT AS RICH AS PEOPLE THINK. BUT ACTUALLY I'M MUCH RICHER. I PUT IN MY FINANCIALS -- IT'S TRUE. FORBES AND ANOTHER GROUP SAID WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE COMPANIES ARE. I PUT IN THESE MASSIVE FINANCIALS AND I WANTED TO BRAG -- IT'S SUCH A GREAT COMPANY I BUILT. THEY SAID HE WILL NEVER PUT IN HIS FINANCIALS. VERY LITTLE DEBT, TREMENDOUS VALUE AND GREAT ASSETS -- ICONIC ASSETS. I HAVE SOME OF THE GREATEST REAL ESTATE IN THE WORLD AND I'M VERY PROUD OF IT. THEY SAY HE WILL NEVER FILE. AND THEY HAVE BOXES. IT WASN'T MEANT FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME. THEY HAVE THESE LITTLE BOXES AND THEY SAY IS IT WORTH OR DOES HE MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS? THE LAST BOX IS $50 MILLION OR MORE. I HAVE A LOT OF OLD THINGS WORTH MORE THAN THAT AND A LOT OF ASSETS WORTH MORE THAN THAT. 50 MILLION OR MORE. I THINK IT IS 23. I CHECK -- I THINK IT'S 23. THEY WILL KILL ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT I'M NOT SURE. I THINK IT'S LIKE 23 -- DO YOU KNOW WHAT SOME OF THESE GUYS DO TO TRY TO MARGINALIZE YOU? THEY ADDED UP -- 23 50'S. SOME OF THEM ARE WORTH A BILLION DOLLARS. SOME OF THEM ARE WORTH MORE THAN A BILLION. THEY WILL TAKE FIFTH THE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A LIVING THAT MIGHT BE WORTH A BILLION DOLLARS AND THEY ADD THEM UP AND SAY HE'S WORTH $2.9 BILLION. THIS IS THE PRESS. IT'S NOT MEANT FOR A GUY LIKE ME BUT WITH ALL OF THAT, THE STATEMENTS ARE SO GOOD. AND LAST NIGHT WAS INCREDIBLE. WE HAD AN AMAZING EVENT IN MASSACHUSETTS. LOOK AT THIS -- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING IN NASHVILLE? WHAT IS THAT? I MUST HAVE DROPPED THOSE PEOPLE WITH ME. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? SO, HERE I AM -- ICE WENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON JET FUEL. A LOT OF MONEY. BUT SOMEBODY PUTS UP A SIGN, $100 TO GO TO THIS THING. I DON'T KNOW WHO DID IT. ALL OVER THE PLACE, I'M SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I'M TURNING DOWN MILLIONS -- I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY. SOMEBODY PUT A SIGN UP TALKING ABOUT A $100 CONTRIBUTION WHICH YOU DID NOT HAVE TO MAKE. IT'S ALL OVER THE INTERNET -- TRUMP IS ASKING FOR $100. I FLY MY PLANE SOMEPLACE AND IT COSTS A FORTUNE. THE MONEY I RAISED LAST NIGHT GOES TOWARD PAYING OFF AND EXPENSE OR SOMETHING -- GUY WHO HAD IT -- THIS GREAT GUY -- REALLY SUCCESSFUL GUY. YOU KNOW HIM -- BERNIE. HE WILL SELL YOU A CAR ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. 2000 PEOPLE SHOWED UP. THEY PUT UP A SIGN -- I DON'T WANT THE MONEY. I'VE MIGHT LIKE $4 MILLION OR FIVE ILION DOLLARS, THAT'S HARD TO TURN DOWN. MOST OF THE PEOPLE CAME IN FREE AND I AND THAT WITH THIS BIG STORY -- TRUMP ACCEPTING CONTRIBUTIONS. I GOT SO ANGRY AT MY PEOPLE BECAUSE SOMEBODY PUT UP A SIGN SAYING $100. AND HONESTLY -- IT'S PEANUTS. IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. BUT THEY USE IT TO TRY TO MARGINALIZE. THEY ALWAYS DO. THE BOTTOM LINE IS I AM SELF FUNDING MY CAMPAIGN. I DON'T NEED MONEY. WITH THAT BEING SAID, THIS MONEY COMES IN AND IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY, BUT IT IS GREAT MONEY. PETER WILL SEND ME SOME MONEY, BUT A WOMAN SENT ME SEVEN DOLLARS WITH A BEAUTIFUL LETTER FROM GEORGIA. ANOTHER'S PERSON -- AND OTHER PERSONS AT ME $12 -- IT DOESN'T AMOUNT TO A LOT, BUT THAT I DO LIKE COMING IN BECAUSE THEY INVEST IN THE CAMPAIGN. HOW DO I TAKE IT SEVEN DOLLARS CHECK AND SEND IT BACK TO THE PERSON WHO SENDS IT TO ME? I'M SORRY, I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY? I WANT THEM TO INVEST AND THEY ARE NOT GOING TO TELL ME TO DO THIS OR NOT DO THIS FOR CHINA AND THEY GAVE ME $5 MILLION. I HAD A BIG LOBBYIST WHO WANTED TO GIVE ME $5 MILLION AND I TURNED HIM DOWN. I TURNED HIM DOWN AND I SEE THIS STORY ON CNN LAST NIGHT AND IT WAS DISGUSTING -- THIS SIGN -- $100. SOMEBODY DOES THE SIGN -- IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL SIGN IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. THEY ARE DOING THIS DAY THING ALL DAY LONG -- WE HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE EVENT AND THEY DESTROYED IT BY TRYING TO MARGINALIZE AND THAT'S THE PRESS, THAT IS THE MEDIA. THE CRIMINAL MEDIA -- THERE IS SOME TRUTH TO IT. A LOT OF TIMES, THEY KNOW IT'S WRONG, BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU -- IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAN LAST NIGHT WAS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE EVENT, IT HAD TO BE A RECORD FOR A HOUSE. THE GUY HAS A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE IN PUT UP A TENT, BUT WE HAD 2000 PEOPLE. IT HAD TO BE A RECORD. THE SPIRIT IN THAT GROUP, THE SPIRIT IN ALABAMA WAS SO INCREDIBLE. THE SPIRIT IN OUR LAST MEETING IN IOWA. DON'T FORGET -- YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE? I'M LEADING WITH THE TEA PARTY BIG. I LOVE THE TEA PARTY TEA PARTY PEOPLE STAND UP AND TAKE A BOW. YOU HAVE NOT TREATED FAIRLY. YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TREATED FAIRLY. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE TEA PARTY AND TALK ABOUT MARGINALIZING -- AT LEAST I HAVE A MICROPHONE AND I CAN FIGHT BACK. THE TEA PARTY PEOPLE ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. A WORK HARD AND THEY LOVE THEIR COUNTRY AND ALL THE TIME BY THE MEDIA. -- THEY GET BEAT UP ALL THE TIME BY THE MEDIA. YOU DON'T KNOW THE POWER THAT YOU HAVE. THE TEA PARTY -- AND YOU CAN CALL IT ANYTHING YOU WANT. I DON'T CARE ABOUT NAMES. THE TEA PARTY HAS TREMENDOUS POWER. IT DEMOCRATS, IT'S FOR PEOPLE, IT'S RICH PEOPLE, IT EVERYBODY. IT'S EVANGELICALS. I'M A PROTESTANT, I'M A PRESBYTERIAN. I HAD A RECENT POLL AND THESE POLLS ARE GREAT -- GUYS LIKE JEB BUSH AND HILLARY HIGHER BOLSTERS AND PAY THEM HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO THAT FOR? I'M RICH, I COULD HIRE 100 POLLSTERS -- WHY SHOULD I PAY? ONE ONCE LIKE 150 DOLLARS A MONTH. THEY ARE ARROGANT GUYS IN A INK THEY CAN TELL YOU WHAT TO SAY AND YOU HAVE TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT -- I DON'T HAVE TIME. IT'S TRUE. I DON'T HAVE TIME. IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT. YOU SAW THE ANCHOR BABY THING. IT'S THE SAME NETWORK, CNN AGAIN. HE SAID YOU KNOW THE NAME ANCHOR BABY IS VERY INSULTING. I SAID WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT AND HE GAVE ME LIKE NINE WORDS -- I SAID HOW CAN I SAY THAT? IT'S TOO LONG. IT'S ANCHOR BABY. AND THEN JEB BUSH GETS CAUGHT BECAUSE HE'S SUCH A NICE PERSON -- HONESTLY. IF YOU WANT A NICE PERSON, YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR JEB. THE COUNTRY'S GOING TO GO TO HELL, BUT WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT. IF YOU WANT A NICE PERSON -- JEB HAS A MEMO THAT HE SIGNED OF BASICALLY A POLITICALLY CORRECT MEMO -- DON'T SAY THIS OR DON'T SAY THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS -- NEVER USE THE TERM ""ANCHOR BABY."" ALL, HE'S USING THIS TERM -- AND WHEN I USED IT, NOBODY CRITICIZED ME. THEY EXPECTED IT. WITH HIM, THEY JUST KILLED HIM. THEN HE BLAMED IT ON THE ASIANS. DID YOU HEAR THAT ESCHEW MARK AND THE NEW YORK TIMES DID AN EDITORIAL -- HOW DARE YOU ATTACK THE ASIANS. HE SAID THAT AGENTS COME IN AND THEY HAVE ANCHOR BABIES AND NOW THE ASIANS ALL HATE THEM. IT'S TRUE. BUT THE ASIANS LOVE ME AND I LOVE THEM. I LOVE THEM. SO HE HAS A MEMO AND HE SIGNS THE MEMO AND IT SAYS DON'T USE THIS TERM AND NOW HE'S USING IT BECAUSE HE HAS TO BECAUSE THINK OF IT -- I WANT TO BUILD A WALL. IT'S SO EASY.  WHEN THIS CLOWN -- SHE'S A BASEBALL PLAYER -- JOSE REYES IS A BASEBALL PLAYER. WHEN RAYMO'S GOT UP THE OTHER DAY, SCREAMING AND RANTING AND I HAD ALL OF THESE ORDERS -- THE REPORTERS WERE ON MY SIDE, BUT THIS GUY STARTS SCREAMING, SO I HAD LIBERAL PEOPLE FROM CBS -- THIS GUY STANDS UP AND STARTS SCREAMING. I GOT A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THE WAY WE HANDLED IT. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, EXCEPT -- ""THE TIMES"" SAID DONALD RAILED AT HIM AND SCREAMED AT HIM. I DID NOT RAIL AT HIM, BUT HE WAS SCREAMING AT ME. WORSE THAN THAT, THEY SAID I WEAR A TO PAY. I PROVED IT -- I WON'T BRING ANYBODY YET, BUT I DON'T. BUT INK ABOUT IT -- I'M ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES -- THINK ABOUT IT, I'M ON THE ""FRONT -- I'M ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE ""NEW YORK TIMES"" SAYING THEY CALL THEM SOMETHING, WHICH MEANS THAT HE WEARS A TO PAY. I'M ON THE FRONT PAGE AND I CAN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. THEY SAID I WAS ESSENTIALLY SCREAMING AT THIS GUY FROM UNIVISION, WHO I HAPPEN TO BE SUING FOR $500 MILLION. THEY DID NOT MENTION THAT. THEY ALSO DID NOT HIS DAUGHTER WORKS FOR HILLARY CLINTON. YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT? THEY DID NOT MENTION THAT. THEY SAID I WEAR A TO PAY AND I WAS SCREAMING. THEN WE LET HIM COME BACK AND WE HAD A NICE TALK AND HE SEEMED LIKE A NICE GUY -- HE WAS A VERY EMOTIONAL AND. HE SAID YOU CAN'T WILL THE WALL BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO IT. 2000 YEARS AGO, IN CHINA -- WE ALWAYS GET BACK TO CHINA. 2000 YEARS AGO, THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA. THIS IS A SERIOUS WALL. THIS IS A WALL YOU DO NOT GO THROUGH EASY. THEY BUILT A WALL 2000 YEARS AGO THAT IS THE TEAM THOUSAND MILES. THINK OF THAT. THAT'S A SERIOUS WALL. THIS WAS 2000 YEARS AGO. IT TOOK THEM 500 YEARS TO BUILD IT -- IT TOOK A LONG TIME. THEY HAD NO TRACTORS. THEY DID NOT HAVE CATERPILLARS. TODAY, WE WOULD USE COMMODITIES BECAUSE THEY ARE CHEAPER. THEY DEVALUE THE YEN SO MUCH -- CATERPILLAR STOCK IS DOWN. WE WILL CHANGE THAT, BELIEVE ME. BUT THEY BUILT THIS WILL. WE HAVE 2000 MILES AS OPPOSED TO 13,000, BUT YOU DON'T NEED IT. SOME YOU HAVE NATURAL LANDSCAPE -- 10 YEARS AGO, EVERYBODY WANTED THE WALL ELSE. HILLARY WANTED THE WALL. I'M NOT A RENDERING GUY. A LOT OF THESE GUYS COME IN WITH RENDERINGS AND IT NEVER GETS BUILT. I'M THE OPPOSITE. I GET IT ELSE. ONE OF THE REASONS IT COULD NOT GET ELDERS THEY COULD NOT GET AN APPROVED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY -- ONE OF THE REASONS THEY COULD NOT GET IT BUILT WAS BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT GET AN APPROVED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY. THEY COULD NOT GET IT APPROVED TO BUILD A WALL AND THEY ARE TELLING PEOPLE WE HAVE A LEGAL IMMIGRANTS -- YOU SEE IT WITH SAN FRANCISCO, WITH SO MANY PEOPLE LAST NIGHT IN NASA CHOOSES -- I MET SOME UNBELIEVABLE FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO COME INTO THE COUNTRY UNTIL MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILY. A FEMALE, A VETERAN GOT RAPED, SODOMIZED, TORTURED AND KILLED. RAPED, SODOMIZED, TORTURED AND KILLED. 66 YEARS OLD, BY AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT THAT THEY CAUGHT. LUCKILY, BUT THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE STUPID PEOPLE IN OUR GOVERNMENT AND WE HAVE PEOPLE POURING ACROSS THE BORDER AND WE HAVE GREAT BORDER PATROL PEOPLE. I WENT THERE -- THAT'S WHY THE HAT IS SO SUCCESSFUL. EVERYBODY WANTS TO BUY THE HAT. THE WHITE WHEN DID NOT SELL SO WELL BUT THE RED ONE IS HOT. CRAZY THING. I WENT TO THE BORDER AND I GOT TO KNOW THE PEOPLE AND I SAW PEOPLE AND IT IS ROUGH STUFF. WHEN I FIRST CAME IN AND DID MY OPENING STATEMENT THAT I WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, I TALKED ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. RUSH LIMBAUGH, WHO I THINK IS A TERRIFIC GUY. RUSH LIMBAUGH SAID TRUST -- TRUMP HAS RECEIVED MORE INCOMING AND IN ANY -- AND THEN I THINK HE'S GOING TO APOLOGIZE AND HE DOUBLES DOWN. I GOT CREDIT. THEY THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO APOLOGIZE STOP I DON'T MIND APOLOGIZING, BUT I HAVE TO MAKE A MISTAKE TO APOLOGIZE, BUT I WAS RIGHT. SO FOR TWO WEEKS, I TOOK INCOMING, MEANING THAT MEDIA. I SAID IF IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE THIS FOR THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF, I DON'T THINK I CAN MAKE IT. MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO TALK THAT WAY ONLY BECAUSE OF ME IS EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. THEY WOULDN'T EVEN BE TALKING ABOUT IT. WE ARE GOING TO GET THE GANG MEMBERS AND BALTIMORE AND CHICAGO. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I'M GOING TO DO IS GET RID OF THOSE GANG MEMBERS. LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN CHICAGO AND FERGUSON -- WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF THOSE TANK MEMBERS SO FAST. WE CAN BE REALLY TOUGH. THOSE POLICE ARE TOUGH COOKIES. WE NEED LAW AND ORDER. WE NEED LAW AND ORDER. THEY ALLOWED IN THAT FIRST NIGHT IN BALTIMORE, THEY ALLOWED THAT CITY TO BE DESTROYED. THEY SAID IT BACK 35 YEARS AND ONE NIGHT BECAUSE THE POLICE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO PROTECT PEOPLE. WE HAVE INCREDIBLE LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE HEAD OF THE POLICE IN CHICAGO IS A PERSON I KNOW. HE'S A PHENOMENAL GUY. HE CAN STOP GANGS IF HE'S ALLOWED TO STOP THEM. WE HAVE SOME INCREDIBLE PEOPLE BUT WE HAVE TO BE TOUGH AND WE HAVE TO BE SMART. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THAT APPLE AND IT IS DISGUSTING AND IT IS HORRIBLE, BUT IT'S A TINY PERCENTAGE. THE GOOD WORK DOES NOT GET SHOWN ON TELEVISION, WHICH IS 99.9%. THE GOOD WORK WITH THE POLICE IS 99.9%. AND IT IS HORRIBLE -- I AGREE. YOU WERE SICK WHEN YOU LOOKED AT SOME OF THEM JUST LIKE I WAS, BUT WE NEED LAW AND ORDER. WE NEED OUR POLICE. THEY DO A PHENOMENAL JOB BUT THEY ARE AFRAID TO DO ANYTHING. I WON'T MENTION NAMES, BUT I KNOW CITIES WHERE POLICE ARE EVEN AFRAID TO TALK TO PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO RETIRE AND HAVE THEIR PENSION. THEN YOU WONDER WHY THERE IS CRIME AND OUR CITIES. WE NEED A WHOLE NEW MINDSET. WE HAVE TO BUILD UP OUR MILITARY. WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR MILITARY SO STRONG. WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR MILITARY SO POWERFUL AND STRONG THAT WE NEVER HAVE TO USE IT. WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON WHAT WE HAVE -- UKRAINE. I WANT UKRAINE TO BE HEALTHY, VIBRANT, AND GOOD. BUT UKRAINE, GERMANY -- WE ARE SENDING F-22'S -- THE NEWEST FIGHTERS, THE BEST AND THE WORLD. WE WANT TO STAND ALONGSIDE OF THEM, BUT WHY ARE WE LEADING THE FIGHT? PUTIN HATES OBAMA. I THINK WE WOULD GET ALONG GREAT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. HE HAS NO RESPECT FOR OUR PRESIDENT AND OUR PRESIDENT DOESN'T LIKE HIM. BUT I WOULD GET ALONG WITH THESE PEOPLE. EVERY COUNTRY IS RIPPING US OFF. IN THE IRAN DEAL, RUSSIA IS A BIG THAT FISHERY BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO SELL IRAN MISSILES WITH THE MONEY WE GIVE TO IRAN, SO ONE OF THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARIES AS RUSSIA. THINK OF IT -- LET'S TAKE A FEW OF THESE THINGS AND THEN I'M GETTING THE HELL OUT OF HERE AND GOING BACK TO NEW YORK. MAYBE I WILL GO TO THE GRAND OLE OPRY TONIGHT. CAN I DO THAT? THIS IS NOT A POLITICIAN SPEAKING. I LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC. I LOVE IT. TRACE ADKINS, RIGHT? WHO ELSE ONE ON THE APPRENTICE? JOHN RICH. MIKE KIDS LOVE THOSE TWO GUYS. AND WHO ELSE DID REALLY WELL? WENT BLACK. CLINT BLACK. I SAID WHO THE HELL IS HE? I DID NOT KNOW WHO HE WAS AND IS THAT SHE WAS NOT A DIG NAME. HIS RECORD OR ALBUM OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT NOW DAYS. WHATEVER IT WAS, IT WENT TO NUMBER ONE. IT CAME TO ME THE NEXT YEAR AND HE CAME IN SECOND AND THEN HE CAME IN FIRST. HE'S A FANTASTIC I STOP THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE. HE CAME TO ME AND HE SAID LAST YEAR I COULDN'T GET INTO THE SHOW AND THIS YEAR I'M POSTING IT ALL BECAUSE OF YOU. RIGHT? THOSE THREE GUYS ARE GREAT. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SO STRONG. WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY RICH AGAIN. A PERSON CAME UP TO ME AND SAID THAT'S NOT NICE. WHAT'S NOT NICE IS MARK TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY RICH. WE ARE A DEBTOR NATION. WE KNOW $19 TRILLION. CHINA, WE 01 $.4 TRILLION. THEY COME AND TAKE OUR JOB, THEY TAKE OUR BASE AND THEIR FACTOR AND WE OH THEM ONE POINT $4 TRILLION. HOW DO YOU DO THAT? IT'S LIKE A MAGIC ACT. JAPAN SELLS AS CARS BY THE MILLION AND MAKE A FORTUNE. THEY SELL US CARS BY THE MILLIONS AND WE OH THEM THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT. WE OH THEM $1.4 TRILLION. HOW COME IF THEY ARE SELLING US CARS WE OH THEM MONEY? IF WE BUY ALL THESE CARS, I'D WE HAVE THE MONEY? BECAUSE THEY TAKE ALL OF THAT MONEY THAT WE MAKE AND BY OUR BONDS. THEY TAKE THE INTEREST AND WE OH THEM MONEY. IT'S NOT EVEN GOING TO BE HARD. OBAMA NEVER READ ""THE ART OF THE DEAL."" SOMEBODY SAID -- WHERE IS SHARON -- SHE GAVE ME SUCH A HARD TIME. WHERE THE HELL IS SHE ESCHEWED MARK YOU CAN HAVE BOTH OF THEM STAND UP ACTUALLY. WHERE ARE THEY? SHARON IS GREAT. DID THEY GO AFTER HER. WHERE IS MY OTHER SHARON. GET THE HELL OFF STAGE.  SHE TOOK A LOT OF INCOMING. GET OFF STAGE. THANK YOU, DARLING. WE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT, IF I GET ELECTED, AND AGAIN, THEY SAID HE WOULD NEVER RUN AND THESE GUYS -- GIVE ME A BREAK, IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. ONE GUY -- JOHN MCLACHLAN. YOU EVER WATCH THAT? I LIKE HIM. ONE OF THE PEOPLE SAID DONALD TRUMP IS A GREAT BUSINESSMAN, BUT HE WILL NEVER MAKE IT AS PRESIDENT. AND JOHN MCLACHLAN, HE'S A GUY WHO I LIKE -- I NEVER MET HIM BUT HE'S SITTING  UO THERE AND HE GOT ANGRY. HE SAYS WHY WOULDN'T HE MAKE IT MARK HE'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS AT EVERYTHING HE'S DONE. I GO ALL OVER THE WORLD AND SEE HIS NAME. HE HAS HAD GREAT ACCESS. HE SAID HE IS A MAN OF GREAT ACHIEVEMENT. WHY WOULDN'T HE MAKE IT? I THOUGHT IT WAS SO NICE AND THE OTHER GUY JUST SORT OF SHUT UP. YOU NEED SOMEBODY OF GREAT ACHIEVEMENT. I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT OBAMA CARE. I TAKE SUCH GOOD CARE OF MY EMPLOYEES. WE HAVE GREAT PLANS. MY EMPLOYEES ARE LUCKY. THEY HAD THE LOTTO. I TAKE CARE -- EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, MY PEOPLE ARE VERY HAPPY, BUT I'VE DONE THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND I'VE SEEN UP AND DOWNS. I'VE SEEN MARKET CRASHES AND FRIENDS OF MINE GO BANKRUPT. I'VE NEVER GONE BANKRUPT. THEY SAY TRUMP GOES AND GRABS -- THESE PEOPLE -- WHEN OTHER PEOPLE DO THAT, THEY DO IT ALL THE TIME, IT'S CALLED USING YOUR HEAD. IT'S CALLED USING THE LAWS. I DID A GOOD JOB IN THE DEBATE WHEN CHRIS MATTHEWS SO ANGRILY -- I DO IT EVERY GREAT BUSINESSMAN DOES. ONE COMPANY WAS SORT OF INTERESTING. A FRIEND OF MINE HAD IT -- A GOOD GUY AND THE BANKS JUST WERE KILLING HIM. THANKS CAN BE MEAN. WE HAVE TO TEACH THEM HOW TO BEHAVE. THIS GUY -- I DID HIM A FAVOR AND CALLED UP AND SAID DO THIS, DO THAT, WE WON'T DO THAT -- YOU ARE MAKING A MISTAKE. IT WAS A LITTLE COMPLICATED -- IMMEDIATELY I SAID DON'T DO THIS. I THREW IT INTO A CHAPTER AND THEY COME OUT WITH TRUMP FILES BANKRUPTCY. THEY SEE ME WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND THEY GO PAY -- THEY GO HEY. I'M GOOD AT THAT STUFF BUT YOU HAVE TO USE THE LAWS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE. ATLANTIC CITY -- CAESARS WENT BANKRUPT. CAESARS FILED FOR CHAPTER 11. NOBODY CARES. AND YOU ARE RIGHT. EVERYBODY IN ATLANTIC CITY -- THE FINANCIAL MEDIA GIVES ME GREAT CREDIT BECAUSE I HAVE A VISION FOR THINGS. I SAID DON'T GO INTO IRAQ EVEN THOUGH I'M A VERY MILITARISTIC PERSON. I SAID YOU ARE GOING TO DESTABILIZE THE MIDDLE EAST. WHAT DO YOU GET? $2 TRILLION, THOUSANDS OF DEATHS LIKE 5000 -- WOUNDED WARRIORS WHO I LOVE ALL OVER THE PLACE. THEY RAN IS TAKING OVER -- IRAN IS TAKING OVER IRAQ. THE OIL THEY DON'T GET, ISIS IS GETTING. WHAT DO WE GET? NOTHING. WE GOT FAR LESS THAN NOTHING. I HAD VISION IN 2004 -- REUTERS -- TRUMP SAYS DON'T DO IRAQ. I'M MUCH MORE MILITARISTIC THAN BUSH AND EVEN THE BROTHER BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHEN TO USE IT AND WHEN. WITH ATLANTIC CITY, SEVEN YEARS AGO, I GOT OUT. I SHOULD GET CREDIT FOR VISION. NORMALLY I WOULD NOT SAY THIS, BUT I NEED YOUR FRICKIN' VOTES. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? I HAVE GREAT CREDIT AND I GOT OUT. MOST PLACES WHEN I GRABBED, BUT I MADE A LOT OF MONEY IN ATLANTIC CITY AND HAD A GREAT TIME. BUT I GAVE A GREAT DANCER AND THOUGHT I SOLVED IT. WE ARE GOING TO DO THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE YOU SO PROUD IF I WIN. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE VICTORIES AGAIN. LAST NIGHT IN FRONT OF THE AUDIENCE -- I'VE NEVER SAID THIS BEFORE -- LAST NIGHT IN FRONT OF THE AUDIENCE, I SAID WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SO MANY VICTORIES -- WE'RE GOING TO WIN ON TRADE AND MILITARILY, JUST HAVING GREAT STRENGTH THAT NOBODY IS GOING TO MESS WITH US. SO MANY VICTORIES, IN FACT, YOU MAY GET TIRED OF VICTORIES. EVERYONE STOOD UP AND SAID NO, NO, WE WANT TO KEEP WINNING. IF I WIN, WE WILL HAVE VICTORIES. WE WILL WIN ON TRADE. WE WILL WIN ON HEALTH CARE. WE WILL WIN ON EVERYTHING. I WILL PROTECT YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY WITHOUT CUTS. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS SO SPECIAL AND I TOLD THE -- I WILL SAY AT ONCE -- WE WILL MAKE AMERICA TRULY GREAT ONCE AGAIN AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU, ALL DAY LONG, HE HAS BEEN HOLDING. THANK YOU ARI MUCH. -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GIVE ME THAT.  ","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Speech in Nashville, Tennessee"

WE HAVE A COUNTRY NOT DOING SO WELL. WE HAVE POLITICIANS OTHER THAN THE FEW POLITICIANS WHO ARE WITH US TONIGHT. WE WILL EXCLUDE THEM. WE HAVE POLITICIANS WHO DO NOT HAVE A CLUE. THEY HAVE -- THEY ARE ALL TALK AND NO ACTION. WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THIS COUNTRY IS DISGRACEFUL. AND WHEN I ANNOUNCED I WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, I BROUGHT UP THE SUBJECT OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.   AND I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT. THAT, I CAN TELL YOU. RUSH LIMBAUGH ACTUALLY SAID ""INCOMING."" AND TWO WEEKS LATER EVERYBODY WAS APOLOGIZING TO ME. THEY SAW THAT I WAS RIGHT, BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN FRANCISCO -- SUCH AN INCREDIBLE FAMILY, AND SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SO BADLY HURT. THE OTHER DAY IN CALIFORNIA LAST WEEK, A WOMAN, 66 YEARS OLD, A VETERAN, WAS KILLED, RAPED, SODOMIZED, TORTURED, AND KILLED BY AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. WE HAVE TO DO IT. SO, WE ARE GOING TO TALK. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF FUN. THE WEATHER IS A LITTLE DICEY. THAT'S OK. WHO CARES IF IT RAINS, RIGHT? RIGHT?   IF IT RAINS, I WILL TAKE OFF MY HAT AND I WILL PROVE -- I WILL PROVE ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT IT IS MINE, OK? SO, WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT SUBJECTS, AND TONIGHT IS FRIDAY NIGHT, WHAT THE HECK, RIGHT? WHAT IS BETTER? WHAT IS BETTER?   WHAT PEOPLE? THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT THIS COUNTRY, THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE HERE. THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT THIS COUNTRY. GOOD PEOPLE. SO, WE WILL START WITH A LITTLE TALK ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, WHAT IS GOING ON. WE'VE GOT TO STOP IT. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL, AND IT'S GOT TO BE -- YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING. THE POLITICIANS, 10 YEARS AGO, 15 YEARS AGO THEY ALL WANTED A WALL. IT NEVER HAPPENS. BECAUSE SOMEBODY DID NOT WANT IT. PROBABLY A LOBBYIST. ALL OF THESE GUYS LIKE BUSH AND HILLARY CLINTON, THEY ARE ALL TAKEN CARE OF. I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU KNOW --    NO, WHEN HILLARY HAS $60 MILLION AND WHEN JEB BUSH, WHEN JEB BUSH -- WHO IS TOTALLY IN FAVOR OF COMMON CORE, WEEK ON IMMIGRATION --   VERY WEAK ON IMMIGRATION, WANTS TO LET PEOPLE COMMENT, ALTHOUGH TODAY HE IS USING ""ANCHOR BABIES."" HE PUT OUT A MEMO SAYING, YOU CANNOT USE ""ANCHOR BABIES."" NOW THAT I HAVE USED IT, HE IS USING IT. HE HAS $14 MILLION. IN HILLARY'S CASE, SHE HAS $60 MILLION. I DO NOT KNOW IF SHE WILL MAKE IT TO THE GATE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I'M NOT SURE SHE IS MAKING IT TO THE GATE. SOME BAD THINGS CAME OUT TODAY. CLASSIFIED AS YOU KNOW THE WORD CLASSIFIED? YOU KNOW, THEY DESTROYED GENERAL PETRAEUS OVER LESS AND NOTHING SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING HERE. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS ULTIMATELY. BUT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW -- AND I JUST GOT THESE NUMBERS TODAY. I SAID WHAT ARE THEY? 7.5% OF ALL OF THE BIRTHS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, OK? CAN'T AFFORD IT. AND THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO STAY. I TURNED OUT RIGHT. THE 14TH AMENDMENT. I HAD THESE GUYS SAY, OH, YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE 14TH AMENDMENT. IT WILL TAKE SO LONG. ON THAT I AGREE, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THE 14TH AMENDMENT, I WAS RIGHT. YOU CAN DO SOMETHING WITH IT AND YOU CAN DO SOMETHING FAST. YOU CAN DO SOMETHING FAST.   SO, WE HAVE 300,000 BABIES A YEAR THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF, WE ALL HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR IT IN THE CASE OF OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING MEXICO, THEY DO NOT DO THAT. IT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY. YOU DO NOT WALK UP THE BORDER ONE DAY AND ALL THE SUDDEN WE HAVE ANOTHER AMERICAN CITIZEN. MEXICO DOES NOT DO NOT DO IT. VERY FEW PLACES DO IT. WE ARE THE ONLY PLACE JUST ABOUT THAT IS STUPID ENOUGH TO DO IT.   SO -- I DECIDED TO RUN. I HAVE GOTTEN AN AMAZING RECEPTION AT -- RECEPTION. I HAVE TO SAY. THIS HAS BEEN GREAT.  IT HAS BEEN WHILE. THE OTHER DAY, I HAD JURY DUTY. THEY HAD A LINE FOR OCCUPATION. I REFUSE TO PUT DUMB POLITICIAN. WE HAVE A GREAT GUY. HE HAS BEEN SO SPOT ON, SO HIGHLY RESPECTED. HAS ANYONE EVER HEARD OF SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS?  JEFF, WHERE ARE YOU? COME UP. LOOK AT HIM. HE IS LIKE 20 YEARS OLD. UNBELIEVABLE GUY.   THANK YOU. HE WAS SO GREAT. SUCH A HELP. I GO AROUND AND I SEE SO MANY PEOPLE AND I HAVE BEEN TREATED SO WELL BY THE PEOPLE AND WE ARE LEAVING IN EVERY POLL. WE ARE LEAVING AND JUST ABOUT EVERY STATE, INCLUDING ALABAMA.  WE ARE LEAVING IN FLORIDA. -- WE ARE LEAVING IN FLORIDA.   WE ARE LEAVING BIG IN FLORIDA. IT'S INTERESTING. FLORIDA, I LOVE FLORIDA. IT'S A GREAT PLACE, RIGHT? BUT FLORIDA, WE HAVE A GOVERNOR, WE HAVE A SITTING SENATOR, AND I'M KILLING THEM. OBVIOUSLY, THEY ARE NOT DOING A VERY GOOD JOB. BECAUSE THAT SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING, BUT WE ARE WINNING IN FLORIDA, PENNSYLVANIA, IOWA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, SOUTH CAROLINA, NOR AIRLINER, TEXT -- NORTH CAROLINA, TEXAS. AND THEN NATIONALLY, WE ARE JUST ABSOLUTELY WAY AHEAD OF EVERYBODY ELSE. IN FACT, IF THIS WERE ANOTHER COUNTRY, WE COULD MAYBE CALL FOR AN EXPEDITED ELECTION, RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW. CAN WE DO THAT? CAN WE DO THAT? I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE ELECTION TOMORROW. I DON'T WANT TO WAIT. SO, THE REASON THAT I THINK WE SEE THIS RECEPTIVITY IS THAT I KNOW THE GAME BETTER THAN ANYBODY. I HAVE BEEN ON THE OTHER SIDE. YOU KNOW, I WAS TOTALLY ESTABLISHMENT. I GAVE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ALL THE TIME TO THESE CHARACTERS. I WAS LIKE THE FAIR-HAIRED BOY. DO I LOOK FAIR HAIRED? BUT I KNEW THE GAME. I UNDERSTAND IT. SO MANY PEOPLE, LOBBYIST. -- SO MANY PEOPLE COME UP, LOBBYISTS. A GUY CAME UP, A GOOD MAN, I KNOW HIM. I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY. -- LOBBYIST. I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY. MAYBE I SHOULD RETHINK IT? SHOULD I RETHINK IT?  CAN I DO THAT? I BUILT A GREAT BUSINESS AND I FEEL SORT OF STUPID. I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY. CAN I TAKE IT PLEASE? I PROMISE I WON'T DO ANYTHING FOR THEM. I TOLD HIM, I DON'T WHAT YOUR MONEY BECAUSE INDEED OF YEARS WHEN YOU COME TO SEE ME ABOUT SOMETHING, I'M NOT DOING IT UNLESS IT IS GOOD OR IT'S GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. RIGHT? BUT I THINK HIM GOING TO HAVE TO RETHINK IT. I'M GOING TO RETHINK THAT BECAUSE I THINK I SHOULD TAKE A LOT OF MONEY -- ARE WE ALLOWED TO GIVE IT TO CHARITY OR SOMETHING? JUST TAKE IT. THESE GUYS COME UP, AND I'M LUCKY. EVERYBODY SAID, HE'S NEVER GOING TO RUN. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? MY WIFE SAID, YOU KNOW -- SHE KNOWS ME PRETTY WELL. AND SHE SEES THE REACTION. FOR A LONG TIME, WHETHER IT WAS TRUMP, THE ARK OF THE DEAL -- WHICH OBAMA AND KERRY OBVIOUSLY DID NOT READ WHEN THEY -- OH, LOOK. ""THE ART OF THE DEAL."" I LOVE THAT BOOK. HEY, GIVE ME THAT BOOK. GIVE ME THAT. THAT IS THE REAL ONE. THAT IS THE ORIGINAL. THAT IS WHEN THEY USED REAL PAPER, RIGHT? I SAID THE OTHER DAY -- BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE CARRY AROUND ""THE ART OF THE DEAL,"" BECAUSE THEY ARE BEGGING, THEY ARE BEGGING THEIR POLITICIANS, READ THE ARTICLE WHEN YOU NEGOTIATE WITH CHINA AND MEXICO AND VIETNAM AND SAUDI ARABIA AND WITH EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE A PROBLEM WHERE NORTH KOREA IS GETTING FRISKY, RIGHT? RECENTLY I ORDERED 4000 TELEVISION SETS. CAN YOU BELIEVE I WAS ABLE TO FIND A GUY -- I KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. YOU KNOW THAT. THERE MADE IN AMERICA AND I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU YOUR BOOK. BELIEVE ME, I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU. BUT THEY ARE MADE IN AMERICA, BUT THE OTHER DAY, AND NOW I SEE TODAY IS PRETTY HOT IN THE NEWS -- OUR VERY DEAR FRIEND FROM NORTH KOREA IS ACTING A LITTLE BIT RAMBUNCTIOUS TODAY. SO I ORDERED 4000 TELEVISION SETS FROM SOUTH KOREA. WHETHER IT IS SAME SONG OR LG OR ANY OF THEM. THEY'RE ALL MADE IN SOUTH KOREA. I TELL YOU, IT'S A FORTUNE. THEY ARE MAKING A FORTUNE. DO WE HAVE ANYBODY WHO MAKES TELEVISION SETS AND THIS COUNTRY? I DON'T THINK SO, RIGHT? THEY ARE MOSTLY MADE, OTHER THAN SONY -- WHICH HAS LOST ITS WAY. THE PRICES ARE TOO HIGH. BUT THEY ARE MOSTLY MADE IN SOUTH KOREA. SO I SEE THAT NORTH KOREA IS ACTING UP. SO, WE ARE GETTING OUR TROOPS READY AND WE ARE GETTING READY, JUST IN CASE -- WE GET NOTHING. WE GET NOTHING. WHAT DO WE GET? WE GET NOTHING? SAUDI ARABIA -- AND I GET ALONG GREAT WITH ALL OF THEM. THEY SPEND $40 MILLION, 50 MILLION DOLLARS. AM I SUPPOSED TO DISLIKE THEM? I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH. SAUDI ARABIA MAKES $1 BILLION A DAY. A DAY. IN ALL FAIRNESS, THAT IS BEFORE THE OIL WHEN DONE A LITTLE BIT. THAT'S OK. THESE ARE MINOR DETAILS. NOW LET'S MAKE IT HALF A BILLION A DAY. THAT'S NOT SO BAD. WE GET NOTHING. WE GET NOTHING. THEY WOULD NOT BE THERE WITHOUT OUR PROTECTION. EVEN GERMANY, GERMANY IS A POWER . WHO HAS A MERCEDES-BENZ, ANYBODY? A LOT OF PEOPLE. THEY ARE A POWER. THEY PAY US NOTHING. WE DEFEND THE WHOLE WORLD. WOULDN'T IT BE NICE -- SOMEBODY SAID, THAT IS LIKE THE MAFIA. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. THE MAFIA IS NOT SO STUPID, ALL RIGHT? THEY SAY, THAT'S TERRIBLE TO ASK FOR MONEY. THEY SAID IT. THAT'S TERRIBLE. HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY AS FOR MONEY TO DEFEND THE COUNTRY? TELL ME. TELL ME. HOW CRAZY ARE WE? NOW WE ARE SENDING OUR EVERYTHING -- I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, WE'VE GOT THOSE 28,000 TROOPS ON THE BORDER BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA, THAT'S DANGEROUS TERRITORY. THEY ARE IN HARMS WAY. THEY ARE IN HARMS WAY. AND WE GET NOTHING. WE GET NOTHING. OTHER THAN THEY ARE A GOOD COMPETITOR. THEY TAKE OUR TRADE. WE LOSE A FORTUNE WITH THEM. WE LOSE A FORTUNE WITH CHINA. WE DEFEND JAPAN. WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH JAPAN WHERE IF SOMEBODY ATTACKS JAPAN, WE HAVE TO COME TO THE RESCUE, BUT IF WE GET ATTACKED, JAPAN DOES NOT HAVE TO HELP US. DO YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD DEAL?  LIKE SERGEANT BERGDAHL. HAS ANYONE HEARD OF SERGEANT BERGDAHL? THE TRAITOR. I CALLED PRESIDENT OBAMA. SIX PEOPLE AT LEAST, THAT WE KNOW OF, SIX PEOPLE WERE KILLED TRYING TO GET THIS GUY BACK. SIX PEOPLE. THEY WENT AFTER HIM. THEY WANTED TO GET HIM BACK. SO WE GET SERGEANT BERGDAHL AND THEY GET FIVE PEOPLE THEY DESPERATELY WANTED FOR YEARS THAT ARE RIGHT NOW BACK ON THE BATTLEFIELD TRIED TO KILL EVERYBODY, INCLUDING US. HOW STUPID ARE WE? HOW STUPID ARE WE? AND, YOU KNOW, THE REASON -- NO MATTER WHERE I GO, THE OVERNIGHT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, NEW HAMPSHIRE WAS SO INCREDIBLE. EVERY TIME I GO ON TELEVISION, IT'S GOT TO BE LIVE. IT'S ALIVE. I SAID, CAN I HAVE A REST PLEASE? IT IS LIVE ON FOX. WHO LIKES FOX? I LIKE FOX.   IT'S LIVE ON CNN. WHO LIKES CNN?   AND IT'S LIVE ON MSNBC, RIGHT?   THEY ARE STILL WORKING. EVERY TIME I SPEAK, IT HAS TO BE LIVE. IT'S RIDICULOUS, BUT IT'S OK. RIGHT? WE HAVE TO SUFFER WITH IT. BUT LOOK. THE REASON I HAVE THIS REALLY INCREDIBLE ENTHUSIASM, AND THE REALLY APPRECIATE IT WITH THIS WEATHER AND HIS HEAT AND EVERYTHING ELSE, BUT THE REASON I HAVE IT IS BECAUSE I DO KNOW WHAT I'M DOING, AND I DON'T SAY THAT IN A BRAGGADOCIO WAY. YOU PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING, WHATEVER IT IS.   YOU KNOW --  THANK YOU, DARLING. I'M GOING TO SIGN HER BOOK. I'VE GOT TO GET HER THE HELL OUT OF HERE. SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL. MY SECOND FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIME. WHAT IS MY FIRST FAVORITE BOOK?  THE BIBLE. THE BIBLE. AND AS MUCH AS I LOVE ""THE ART OF THE DEAL,"" IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE. WE TAKE THE BIBLE ALL THE WAY, RIGHT?   SO, I WAS SAYING, I'M NOT GOING TO RUN. HE IS NOT GOING TO RUN. HE'S NEVER GOING TO RUN. HE'S JUST HAVING FUN. HIS BRAND -- LIKE I CARE, MY BRAND. AT THIS POINT, MY BRAND. I MEAN, I LOSE GUTLESS MACEY BECAUSE I SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IMMIGRATION. THEY ARE GUTLESS. THEY ARE ALL GUTLESS. I HAVE TO SUE UNIVISION. UNIVISION -- THESE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN. BEAUTIFUL WOMEN. AND I GET DROPPED BY -- THINK OF IT. YOU HAVE THESE MAGNIFICENT WOMEN WHO WORKED ALL THEIR LIVES TO BE IN THE MISS USA CONTEST AND TWO WEEKS BEFORE, NBC AND UNIVISION DROPPED BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT MY TONE WAS A LITTLE BIT STRONG.   AND IT TURNED OUT I WAS RIGHT. SO, HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS. I SUED THEM  I MEAN, IN THE CASE OF UNIVISION, I SUED THEM FOR $500 MILLION. I WANT THAT MONEY. I WANT THAT MONEY. SO, I ACTUALLY PUT IT ON THE OTHER DAY -- MISS USA, BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY FAIR TO THE PEOPLE. WE HAD IT ON THE SMALL NETWORK AND IT WAS FINE, BUT WHO WOULD DO THAT? ALL BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE SO POLITICALLY CORRECT. THE ACTUALLY CALLED AND SAID, WE WILL GET IT BACK ON HIM, WE WILL GET IT BACK ON SOON. THEY SAID ""TRUMP LOSES NASCAR."" IT WAS ALL OVER THE WORLD. I OPENED WITH A STRONG STATEMENT, MEANING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, WE GOT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. NO,. ""TRUMP LOSES NASCAR"" I DON'T HAVE A DEAL WITH NASCAR. IT TURNED OUT -- IT TURNED OUT -- YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID? THEY HAD A BALLROOM. I KEPT THEIR DEPOSIT AND RENTED IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE, BY THE WAY.   I DID NOT EVEN KNOW I HAVE A DEAL WITH THEM. IT TURNS OUT THEY HAD A BALLROOM AND WHAT MY PLACES. THEY ARE OUT. THE NEXT DAY, ESPN SEVERS TIES. I HAVE FRIENDS WHO CALMLY FROM PARIS. A GREAT BUSINESSMAN. OH, IT IS TO BAD WHAT HAPPENED WITH ESPN. I HAVE A GOLF OUTING, THIS WAS A BIG DEAL. THIS IS ALL OVER THE WORLD. THE PAST -- MAYBE THEY DID NOT GET IT, MAYBE THEY DO NOT GET IT. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MACY'S. THEY HEARD THAT THERE WERE GOING TO BE PICKETS IN FRONT OF THE STORE, AND THEY SAID, OH, WE WILL HAVE PICKETS. I SAID, INTAKE OF HOURS THEY WILL BE GONE. THEY WILL GO FOR LUNCH, THEY WON'T COME BACK. THEY SAID, THIS IS SO BAD. CAN WE SEVER TIES? I SAID, I DON'T CARE. I DID NOT LIKE THEIR TIES THAT MUCH ANYWAY. THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA. IT DROVE ME NUTS. IT'S TRUE. I JUST HATE GUTLESS PEOPLE. SO, THE REASON WE ARE GETTING THIS RECEPTIVITY, WHICH IS LIKE IT -- LIKE THIS ALL OVER THE PLACE. I FOUND MY PAPERS AND I SAID I AM GOING TO RUN AND I'M GOING TO SIGN THE BIG DOCUMENT, WHICH IS THE ONE PAGE DOCUMENT WHICH IS BASICALLY YOU'RE GIVING YOUR LIFE AWAY, AND I SIGN AND THEY SAY, OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. THEY PAY HALF $1 MILLION TO MAKE JERKS OUT OF THEMSELVES -- THE PUNDITS. SOME ARE GREAT. SOME ARE -- REALLY AREN'T. HE SAYS I KNOW WHICH ONE. THERE'S MORE THAN ONE. THERE WERE ABOUT 50. NOW THERE IS ABOUT FIVE. THEY'RE COMING AROUND. WHAT HAPPENS -- HE WILL NEVER FILE. HE WILL NEVER FILE, BECAUSE HE IS PROBABLY NOT AS RICH AS PEOPLE THINK. ACTUALLY ONE OF THE REASONS -- I WANT TO FILE MY FINANCIALS. THEY ARE SO GOOD. IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. SO, I HAD ABOUT 102 PAGES, 98 PAGES OF STUFF AND ALL OF THESE BOXES, OVER 50 MILLION, OVER 50 MILLION, AND THEY WERE PHENOMENAL, PHENOMENAL. MUCH BETTER. AND PEOPLE REALIZE -- THIS IS NOT BRAGGING AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY. OVER $10 BILLION. VERY LITTLE DEBT. VERY LITTLE DEBT. TO SHOW YOU HOW STUPID -- IT HAS A LINE FOR INCOME, AND IS IT OVER $400 MILLION A YEAR. IF I COULD QUESTION MARK SON IS HERE. HE CAN LIVE ON THAT. I HAD A LINE FOR INCOME. IT BURIES WITH DIFFERENT THINGS, BUT BASICALLY OVER $400 MILLION AT YEAR. IS THERE ANYBODY WHO WOULD NOT WANT TO MAKE THAT MUCH MONEY IN ONE YEAR HERE? ANYBODY? WITH THAT COMES RESPONSIBILITY, BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS. THE REASON PEOPLE LIKE WHAT I AM SAYING IS BECAUSE I WANT TO PUT THAT ENERGY, WHATEVER THE HELL KIND OF ENERGY IT IS -- I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS SCREWED UP, GENIUS, WHATEVER IT IS. I KNOW HOW TO DO THINGS. WE ARE BUILDING A GREAT BUILDING ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE RIGHT OPPOSITE, BETWEEN, AS YOU KNOW, THE WHITE HOUSE IN THE OLD POST OFFICE. ALWAYS GET THE POST OFFICE. THEY WERE THERE FIRST. I GOT THE OLD POST OFFICE AND WASHINGTON, D.C., AND I GOT IT FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? THAT IS CALLED DEALMAKING. ONE OF THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER BUILDINGS AND WE GOT IT AND WE WERE DOING A GREAT JOB AND THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT WOULD GET DONE. IT WILL BE OPENING. HERE IS THAT LITTLE STORY. IT IS NOW UNDER BUDGET AND AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. DO YOU EVER HEAR THAT FROM GOVERNMENT?   AND WE JUST FINISHED A LOT OF GREAT JOBS. MY SON IS HERE -- HAS ANYONE EVER HEARD OF IVANKA?   I WILL LET THEM RUN IT. I WILL NOT LET THEM DO ANY BIG DEALS. JUST RELAX, ERIC. JUST RELAX. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT QUESTION MARK I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE COMPANY. WHO CARES IF WE DO A BUILDING QUESTION MARK IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. MY WHOLE ENERGY WILL BE TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY RICH AND MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN AREA THAT IS MY WHOLE --    AND I MEAN, IT IS MY WHOLE -- I HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN APTITUDE FOR MAKING MONEY. SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY, MR. TRUMP THAT IS VERY CRASS. YOU SAID YOU WILL MAKE THE COUNTRY RICH. THAT'S VERY CRASS. IN ORDER TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT, I HAVE TO MAKE IT RICH AGAIN. WE ARE A DEBTOR NATION. ANYONE WITH A SIGN THAT BIG HAS TO AGREE. SO, I WILL DEVOTE -- I COULD NOT CARE LESS ABOUT THE OLD POST OFFICE. I COULD NOT CARE LESS ABOUT ANY OF OUR STUFF. I JUST WANT TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY SO GREAT, AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING  LIKE, AS AN EXAMPLE -- I WILL GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES. IN ALABAMA, U.S. STEEL, WITH -- WE HAVE A CLOSURE. I WENT AROUND AND I SAID DOES ANYBODY WORK THERE? BIG CLOSURE. ONE OF THE REASONS IS CHINA IS DUMPING SO MUCH STEEL INTO THE UNITED STATES AND REALLY OTHER COUNTRIES ALSO. BUT CHINA -- I LOVE THAT SIGN, LOOK AT THAT, HUH? WOW. OH, THAT'S TRUE. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS YOU ARE BREAKING EVERYBODY'S VIEW, BUT THE SIGN IS FANTASTIC  SO, CHINA IS DUMPING TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF STEEL INTO OUR COUNTRY. THE GOVERNMENT IS SUBSIDIZING IT. IT IS ALMOST LIKE THEY WANT US TO JUST DIE. AND THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR US. AND AGAIN LIKES OF YOUR RIG IT, LIKE JAPAN -- I GET ALONG WITH THEM GREAT. THE LARGEST BANK IN THE WORLD IS IN ONE OF MY BUILDINGS. THEY SPENT SO MUCH MONEY. AM I SUPPOSED TO DISLIKE THEM? THEIR LEADERS ARE REALLY CUNNING. THEY ARE REALLY SHARP. WE HAVE DUMMIES. WE HAVE DUMMIES. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A CLUE. SOME PEOPLE SAY THEY ARE BAD PEOPLE. I DON'T THINK THEY ARE BAD PEOPLE. I DON'T THINK THEY ARE BAD. I THINK THEY ARE INCOMPETENT. SO, YOU LOOK AT CHINA AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND LAST WEEK -- AND I SAID THIS AND I HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR A LONG TIME READ YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING IT. LAST WEEK, THEY DEVALUE THEIR CURRENCY AND WE ARE HAVING A LOT OF HARD TIMES BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DID. WHEN I HEAR DEVALUATION OF THE CHINESE CURRENCY, YOU KNOW THE WORD BE SUCKING ACTION -- THE SUCKING ACTION LIKE A VACUUM. TWO THINGS HAPPEN. TWO THINGS GET SUCKED OUT OF US. OUR JOBS AND ARE MONEY. THINK OF IT. CHINA SELLS US OUR PRODUCT, TAKES OUR JOBS, DOES A MANUFACTURING FOR US, AND WE OWED THEM $1.4 TRILLION. THAT IS LIKE A MAGIC ACT. I CALL IT THE MAGIC ACT IN REVERSE. WE OWED THEM MONEY. JAPAN -- IN JAPAN IS BACK. THEY HAVE ABE AS THE NEW PRIME MINISTER, AS YOU KNOW, AND ABE IS REALLY SMART. HE IS SMART. I MET HIM ONE TIME. HE IS SHARP. AND HE'S NEGOTIATING AGAINST CAROLINE  AND I WAS WATCHING ""60 MINUTES."" I WILL GIVE YOU GUYS A PLUG. I WAS WATCHING "" 60 MINUTES"" AND THEY ARE DOING A FEATURE ON CAROLYN KENNEDY. YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE HER? MY DAUGHTER LIKES HER. ANYBODY MY DAUGHTER LIKES. WE LOVEIVANKA. -- WE LOVE IVANKA. HOW YOU BECOME THE AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN. WE NEED SOMEBODY SHARP. WE NEED A SMART KILLER. NOT A DUMB KILLER. THERE ARE PLENTY OF DUMB KILLERS, TOO. THEY SAID, HOW DID YOU GET THE AMBASSADORSHIP, AND SHE SAID WELL -- THIS IS PRETTY CLOSE. YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT. SHE SAID, WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I WANTED A JOB. SO I WENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND I SAID, COULD I HAVE A JOB? DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING FOR ME TO DO QUESTION MARK AND THEY SAID, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN? AND SHE SAID REALLY? SHE SAID, I'LL DO IT. SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE SHE GOT IT. AND THEN SHE SHOWED THE REST OF THE SHOW WAS HER BEING WINED AND DINED BY ABE AND ALL OF THESE KILLERS. BEING FETED A DINNER AND LUNCHES AND BREAKFAST. -- BEING FED AT A DINNER AND LUNCHES AND BREAKFASTS. SO, I HAVE THE MEANEST, IN MANY CASES MOST HORRIBLE HUMAN BEINGS ON EARTH. THEY ARE KILLERS. SOME ARE NICE PEOPLE. VERY FEW. SOME ARE NICE PEOPLE. BUT I WILL PUT THE MEANEST, SMARTEST -- WE HAVE THE BEST IN THE WORLD. WE DO NOT USE THEM. WE USE POLITICAL HACKS, DIPLOMATS, PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE ANY BUSINESS ABILITY. WE USE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER DONE A JOB. SOMEONE STOLE MY PLANE. PEOPLE ARE POINTING UP TO THE PLANE. AN EXAMPLE -- CARL ICAHN. ANYONE EVER HEAR OF CARL? HE'S AN UNBELIEVABLY BRILLIANT, TOUGH BUSINESSMAN. I CALL HIM. I SAY, YOU KNOW, CARL, I'M DOING PRETTY WELL. I'M LEAVING EVERY POLL. HE SAID, YOU'RE DOING GREAT. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT EITHER.  I SAID, IF I EVER GET THERE, I WANT YOU TO OVERSEE THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHINA. I CAN GET HIM TWO. HE IS EXTRAORDINARY. I WILL GIVE YOU CHINA AND JAPAN. ""I'LL DO IT, I'LL DO IT!""   REMEMBER WHEN I SAID SOMEONE HAD BLOOD COMING OUT OF HER EYES WITH HATRED? HE HAD BLOOD COMING OUT OF HIS EYES. AT HE IS AN UNBELIEVABLE NEGOTIATOR. UNBELIEVABLE NEGOTIATOR. I KNOW THE BEST. I KNOW THE WORST. I KNOW THE ONES THAT ARE OVERRATED. I KNOW THE ONES YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD ABOUT THAT ARE BETTER THAN ALL OF THEM. BUT CARL IS ONE OF THE GREATEST. HE IS VERY FAMOUS. HE IS VERY RICH. HE WOULD LOVE TO DO IT. HE WOULD LOVE TO GIVE BACK. HE KNOWS WHAT IS HAPPENING. THEY ARE RIPPING US. SO, THEY SEND THIS STUFF OVER HERE AND SOMEBODY OF THE OTHER DAY SAID WHAT CHINA HAS DONE TO THE UNITED STATES IS THE GREATEST SINGLE THEFT IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. SINCE THAT STATEMENT WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA. WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA. SO, WE HAVE FREE TRADE. THE PROBLEM WITH FREE TRADE IS WHEN YOU HAVE FREE TRADE -- VERY IMPORTANT, YOU NEED COMPETENT LEADERS. THAT IS THE ONE PROBLEM WITH FREE TRADE. I LIKE FREE TRADE. I AM A FREE TRADER. YOU NEED GREAT NEGOTIATORS. WE'LL HAVE THAT. WE ARE GETTING KILLED BY EVERYBODY. WE DO NOT MAKE GOOD DEALS. EVERYBODY IS KILLING US. AT SO, WE WILL HAVE UNBELIEVABLE DEALS. A FRIEND OF MINE IS A MANUFACTURER, AND HE'S TRYING TO DO BUSINESS WITH CHINA -- AND HE'S A GOOD MANUFACTURER. MAKES GREAT PRODUCTS. BETTER THAN WHAT THEY DO. THEY DO NOT WANT HIM SENDING STUFF. HE CALLS ME. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO BUSINESS. THEIR STUFF COMES OVER HERE BY THE SHIP LOAD. HE SAYS IS IMPOSSIBLE. HE FINALLY GETS A PRODUCT IN THERE AND THEY CHARGE HIM A MASSIVE TAX WHICH THEY CALL A TARIFF, BECAUSE IT SOUNDS A LITTLE MORE SOPHISTICATED, RIGHT? BOEING DOES BUSINESS WITH CHINA, AND THEY WANT ALL OF THEIR INTEL, ALL OF THEIR COPYRIGHTS, THEY WON EVERYTHING. OTHERWISE WE ARE NOT BUYING YOUR PLANE. I DON'T BLAME CHINA. I RESPECT THEM. I'M NOT ANGRY AT THEM. I'M ANGRY AT OUR LEADERS FOR BEING SO STUPID YOUR IT I'M NOT ANGRY AT CHINA. -- I'M ANGRY AT OUR LEADERS FOR BEING SO STUPID. I'M NOT ANGRY AT CHINA. MEXICO IS THE SAME THING. THE OTHER DAY AND INVESCO -- NABISCO -- OREOS. I LOVE OREOS. I'M NEVER EATING THEM AGAIN. I WILL NEVER EAT THEM AGAIN. NO, NABISCO CLOSES THE PLANT THEY JUST ANNOUNCED A COUPLE DAYS AGO IN CHICAGO AND THEY ARE MOVING TO MEXICO. KNOW WHY? WHY? WHY? HAVE YOU HEARD MY STORY -- HAVE YOU HEARD THE STORY BEFORE? DO WE WANT TO HEAR IT AGAIN OR NOT? YES? ALL RIGHT. IT'S A BIG ONE. FORT, GREAT COMPANY -- FORD, GREAT COMPANY, THEY ARE BUILDING A CAR FACTORY IN MEXICO. THEY ARE CLOSING BASES UP ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES. THEY ARE BUILDING A MASSIVE FACTORY IN MEXICO. IN GRADE SCHOOL I WAS -- HOPEFULLY STILL  REALLY SMART. I WENT TO A GREAT SCHOOL. HARD TO GET INTO. EVEN THEN IT WAS HARD TO GET INTO. I WENT TO THIS GREAT BUSINESS SCHOOL. I FULLY UNDERSTAND. I'M REALLY GOOD AT THIS STUFF. SO, THEY ARE BUILDING A $2.5 BILLION PLAN. THEY WILL SELL THOSE PARTS BACK TO US. WHERE DOES THAT HELP US? EXPLAIN. THERE IS NO TAX. THERE IS NO NOTHING. THERE IS NO NOTHING. SO, CLOSING A PLANT HERE, BUILDING A MASSIVE PLANT IN MEXICO, ANOTHER PLANT, ANOTHER BIG FOREIGN CAR COMPANY -- THERE IS A PLANT BEING BUILT. THEY WERE ALL SET TO GET STARTED. IN TENNESSEE. YOU READ ALL ABOUT IT. A COUPLE MONTHS AGO, ""WALL STREET JOURNAL,"" ALL SET TO GET STARTED. MEXICO TOOK IT AWAY. IT WILL NOT BE BILLED IN KENNETT -- IT WILL NOT BE BUILT IN TENNESSEE. IT WILL BE BUILT IN MEXICO. I DID THIS. IT REALLY IS SORT OF BRIGHT. I GIVE MYSELF THIS SORT OF POSITION. I SAY, LET'S ASSUME SOMEBODY ELSE BECOMES PRESIDENT. WOULDN'T THAT BE HORRIBLE? LET'S ASSUME SOMEBODY ELSE BECOMES PRESIDENT. A VERY LOW-ENERGY PERSON -- A VERY LOW-ENERGY PERSON -- VERY LOW ENERGY, SLOW ENERGY THAT EVERY TIME YOU WATCH THEM, YOU FALL ASLEEP. HE SAID HILLEARY. YEAH, HILLARY, TOO. LET'S SAY JEB BECOMES PRESIDENT. LIKE I SAID, YOUR SCHOOLS GO TO HELL. BUT FORGETTING ABOUT THAT. LET'S SAY JEB DOES NOT WANT THIS PLANT BUILT. THEY WILL CALL HIM, THE HEAD OF FORD. AND THEY WILL SAY, WE DO NOT WANT TO BUILD IT. THE NEXT HOUR, HE WILL GET A CALL FROM THE LOBBYISTS AND THE SPECIAL INTERESTS AND HIS DONORS AND THEY WILL SAY, HEY, JEB, WE GAVE YOU $8 MILLION OF THE $120 MILLION YOU RAISE. WE WANT THAT THING DONE. YOU CANNOT DO THAT TO OUR PEOPLE. OH, OK, IT'S GOING TO GET DONE, OK? LET'S TAKE TRUMP AS PRESIDENT. OK? IS THAT BETTER? IS THAT BETTER?   HERE IS A SIMPLE QUESTION. WHO WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE NEGOTIATING WITH CHINA, JAPAN, MEXICO, ANY OTHER -- TRUMP OR BUSH?  AH, WHAT A GROUP. WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S SORT OF INTERESTING. THANK YOU. CNN DOES THIS BIG REPORT THAT CAME OUT LAST WEEK. EVERYBODY SAYS WHY DON'T I HAVE A POLLSTER? WHY DO I NEED A POLLSTER. EVERYDAY I WAKE UP AND THERE'S ANOTHER POLL. UNLESS THEY HAVE SOMETHING VETTED WITH HER POLLSTER, THEY CAN'T TALK. WHAT DO I NEED? SAVE YOUR MONEY. CNN DOES THIS REALLY EXPENSIVE, REALLY WELL DONE WHOLE. -- WELL DONE POLL. YOU KNOW THE THING I'LL BE GREAT AT? MILITARY. I AM THE TOUGHEST GUY. I WILL REBUILD OUR MILITARY. IT WILL BE SO STRONG AND SO POWERFUL AND SO GREAT. IT WILL BE SO POWERFUL AND SO GREAT THAT WE WILL NEVER HAVE TO USE IT TO READ NOBODY'S GOING TO MESS WITH US, -- IT. NOBODY'S GOING TO MESS WITH US, FOLKS.  I LOOK AT THE VARIOUS THINGS TO DO WITH OUR COUNTRY. THEY DID ANOTHER POLL ON WHO IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR. I WAS THE MOST POPULAR PERSON. THE 35 YEARS THESE SENATORS -- OTHER THAN JEFF -- THE SENATORS, CONGRESSMEN, PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON -- THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS. THEY DO THIS POLL AND IN THE POLL A SCORE REALLY HIGH WITH FOLKS ON ALMOST EVERYTHING. OTHER THAN THEY THOUGHT I WASN'T A NICE PERSON. AND I'M A NICE PERSON. BUT WHO CARES? A WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND SAID, I'M NOT SURE YOU ARE NICE ENOUGH TO BE PRESIDENT. THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE AN ELECTION BASED ON A NICE PERSON. IT'S GOING TO BE BASED ON A COMPETENT PERSON. I WON ON JOBS. I WON ON LEADERSHIP BY MASSIVE NUMBERS. I WON IN ALL THESE CATEGORIES. WE DON'T NEED AN ELECTION. THESE ARE SUCH IMPORTANT CATEGORIES. I'VE HAD AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE BECAUSE FROM THE TIME I ANNOUNCED, ALMOST OTHER THAN THE FIRST WEEK -- THE PRESS, WHICH IS LARGELY VERY DISHONEST -- THE MEDIA -- I ACTUALLY THINK THE POLITICAL MEDIA IS LESS POPULAR THAN CONGRESS. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? AND CONGRESS HAS ALMOST NO RATINGS. LOOK AT ALL THOSE CAMERAS. THEY ARE ALL LIVE AND THEY ARE TRYING TO SHUT OFF THE CAMERA RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE ALL LIVE. SO MANY LIVE CAMERAS.  THANK YOU. THE MEDIA IS VERY DISHONEST BUT THERE ARE A CERTAIN GROUP THAT ARE FANTASTIC PEOPLE. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I GET AN HONEST STORY AND I CHERISH THOSE. THEY REALLY STARTED TREATING ME MUCH BETTER. WHEN I FIRST RAN, I SAID IT'S AMAZING, WENT TO A GREAT SCHOOL, SMART GUY, MY UNCLE WAS A PROFESSOR AT M.I.T.. GOOD FAMILY. DO WE BELIEVE IN THE GENE THING? I DO. LIKE THEY USED TO SAY, SECRETARIAT DOES NOT PRODUCE  I WENT OUT AND BUILT A CHAIRMAN DISCOVERED A. -- TREMENDOUS COMPANY. ""THE ART OF THE DEAL"" IS MAYBE THE BEST-SELLING BUSINESS BOOK OF ALL TIME. I DID ""THE APPRENTICE."" NBC HATES ME BECAUSE THEY RENEWED ""THE APPRENTICE"" AND I SAID, I'M NOT DOING IT. I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I'M GOING TO MAKE THE COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN. THEY ACTUALLY CAME UP TO MY OFFICE. GREAT PEOPLE FROM NBC. THEY SAID, PLEASE RUN. THEY SAID, WE BASED MOST OF THE ADVERTISING. I SAID, I'M GOING TO RUN AND I'M GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT. WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING. I'M HIRED. YOU'RE HIRED. SO, I LOOK AT THE LANDSCAPE OF OUR COUNTRY. I LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE GOING, A LOOK AT WHERE WE'VE BEEN. WE'VE HAD A HORRIBLE NUMBER OF YEARS. WE CAN'T BEAT ISIS. I WATCHED ""THE GENERAL"" ON TELEVISION. HOW DO YOU THINK WE WILL DO AGAINST ISIS? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH. GENERAL GEORGE PATTON, GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR ARE SPINNING IN THEIR GRAVES AS YOU LISTEN TO THIS. HE TALKED ABOUT A HARD TIME. I LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE LANDSCAPE AND THEN I GET TO MEET ALL THE PEOPLE I'VE MET OVER THE LAST PERIOD OF TIME. I WANT TO TELL YOU, IT'S BEEN AMAZING. IT'S BEEN REALLY AMAZING. I WANT TO FINISH UP WITH A COUPLE OF LITTLE POINTS. ONE OF THEM IS THE FORD DEAL. ISRAEL -- I LOVE ISRAEL, BY THE WAY.  THE BOTTOM LINE TO SOME OF YOU -- I LOVE THIS STORY. WHEN I GET THE CALL, I SAY, NO, YOU ARE GOING TO BUILD IN THE UNITED STATES. NO, WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. I WILL BE CALLED BY PEOPLE BUT I WILL NOT HAVE ANY OF THEIR MONEY, SO I DON'T CARE. I WILL CALL THE MEN AND SAY, HERE IS THE STORY. YOU ARE GOING TO CHARGE YOU -- WE'RE GOING TO CHARGE YOU 35%. THAT WILL BE FOR EVERY CAR AND EVERY PART AND EVERY TRUCK THAT COMES INTO THE UNITED STATES. HERE IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AS SURE AS YOU ARE STANDING OR SITTING, THEY ARE GOING TO COME BACK TO ME THE FOLLOWING DAY, I WOULD SAY THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON. I DON'T NEED CARL ICAHN, I DON'T NEED THIS 1 -- IT'S TOO EASY. THEY WILL SAY, MR. PRESIDENT -- I'M GOING TO SAY, NO. WITHIN 24 HOURS THEY WILL SAY, MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO US IS TERRIBLE. WE WILL BUILD IN THE UNITED STATES. WE WILL BUILD A PLAN. 100%. IT DOESN'T HELP US, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON, WHERE TO VISCO'S CLONING, SO MANY PLACES ARE CLOSING, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE KIND OF MONEY -- NABISCO'S CLOSING, SO MANY PLACES ARE CLOSING, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE KIND OF MONEY -- WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT. WE ARE RUNNING ON FUMES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS, THEY ARE SO MUCH SHARPER, THEY ARE SO MUCH SMARTER. WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY LEFT. WE NEED TO HAVE OUR BORDERS AND WE NEED TO MAKE A GREAT DEALS. THE MAN IN THE BACK JUST SHOUTED, ISRAEL. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE ISRAEL RIGHT NOW? THEY RELIED ON US. THEY ARE A VOICE OF SANITY. THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE, AND WE HAVE A DEAL THAT IS SO BAD -- THINK OF THE DEAL. WE MAKE A DEAL, OR CHIEF NEGOTIATOR GOES INTO A BICYCLE RACE AT 73 YEARS OLD. HE BREAKS HIS LEG. THAT WAS THE GOOD PART OF OUR DEAL. I TOLD THIS LAST WEEK, I SWEAR TO YOU I WILL NEVER, EVER RIDE A BICYCLE, AT LEAST IN A RACE, BUT I WILL WRITE ONE ANYWAY -- RIDE ONE ANWYWAY. WE KNOW ALL ABOUT THE 24 DAY PERIOD. THE 24 DAY PERIOD, THAT CLOCK DOES NOT START TAKING FOR A LONG TIME -- TICKING FOR A LONG TIME. THAT COULD BE FOREVER. IF THEY ARE DOING SOMETHING, BELIEVE ME BY THE TIME WE GET THERE -- HERE IS THE ALL-TIME GREAT. FIRST OF ALL, WHY ARE THEY GIVING US BACK OUR PRISONERS? -- AREN'T THEY GIVING US BACK OUR PRISONERS? THE OTHER DAY IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IRAN, IS GOING TO DO THEIR OWN POLICING. THEY ARE GOING TO POLICE AND THEY ARE GOING TO TELL US -- WE SWEAR WE ARE NOT BUILDING ANYTHING. IT'S SO SAD. OBAMACARE.  WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE.  WE ARE GOING TO COME UP WITH A PLAN -- AND THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. YOU DON'T THINK OF OBAMA THIS WAY. DO YOU KNOW WHO THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARIES OF OBAMACARE ARE? THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. REMEMBER I TOLD YOU, SPECIAL INTERESTS AND LOBBYISTS, THE INSURANCE COMPANIES LOVE IT. WE CAN HAVE SUCH GREAT PLANS. IT WOULD GET RID OF THE ARTIFICIAL LINES AROUND EVERY -- I HAVE A HUGE COMPANY. WHEN I NEGOTIATE, I GET ONE GROUP. SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT OWNED BUSINESSES KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE SO PROTECTED, THEY ARE MAKING A FORTUNE. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT SO COMPETITIVE. WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF THE ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS. YOU WILL GET SUCH GREAT PLANS. OBAMACARE -- LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH YOUR PREMIUMS. JUST TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE DEDUCTIBLES. THEY ARE SO HIGH IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. TRADE -- WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT. HEALTH CARE -- WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT. WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES -- WERE'RE GOING TO FIX IT. MY WIFE CAME UP TO ME THE OTHER DAY AND SHE SAID, IT'S REALLY SAD BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CHERISH WOMEN. I WILL PROTECT WOMEN. IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME. I HEARD SOME OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES THE OTHER DAY SAYING WE ARE NOT GOING TO FUND VARIOUS WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES. I SAID, THAT'S THE END OF HIS ELECTION. WOMEN DON'T LIKE THAT TOO MUCH, DO WE AGREE? HE SAID, WE ARE NOT GOING TO FUND WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES. A FEW HOURS LATER HE CAME BACK AND SAID HE MISSPOKE. OK. WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES, SO IMPORTANT. WE ARE GOING TO END UP TAKING OUR COUNTRY -- WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT SO STRONG, SO POWERFUL, SO LOVED BY PEOPLE AGAIN, SO LOVED, YOU KNOW?  ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE -- AND YOU DON'T SEE IT TONIGHT, BUT YOU SEE IT, IS A TREMENDOUS LACK OF SPIRIT. I THOUGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA -- HE WAS INEXPERIENCED, HE NEVER PRODUCED A JOB, LOTS OF OTHER THINGS. I ACTUALLY THOUGHT HE WOULD BE A GREAT CHEERLEADER FOR THE COUNTRY WHEN HE WAS ELECTED. AND HE HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A GREAT DIVIDER. REALLY HAS. YOU LOOK AT BALTIMORE, YOU LOOK IN FERGUSON, ST. LOUIS LAST NIGHT, OVER THE LAST WEEK. YOU LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING. WE ARE SITTING ON POWDER KEGS. THERE'S NO SPIRIT, THERE'S NO JOBS, THERE'S NO ANYTHING. I AM GOING TO BE THE GREATEST JOBS PRESIDENT THAT GOD EVER CR EATED. I WILL TELL YOU. YOU ARE GOING TO BE SO PROUD RED . I OFTENTIMES SAY, THE AMERICAN DREAM IS DEAD, BUT I'M GOING TO MAKE IT BIGGER AND STRONGER AND MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER BEFORE. I AM GOING TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY BIGGER AND STRONGER AND BETTER, AND YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE IT, AND YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE YOUR PRESIDENT, AND WE ARE GOING TO TURN THIS PLACE AROUND AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE SO PROUD. AND YOU KNOW, OUR WHOLE THEME IS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN, AND WE ARE GOING TO LOVE DOING IT, AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE FUN DOING IT. I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY. THIS HAS BEEN REALLY, REALLY SPECIAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.  ","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump Rally in Mobile, Alabama"

SO NICE.     THEY SAY WE SET A RECORD TONIGHT.  I AM GOING TO MAKE THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE ANGRY. THEY LOVE ME. I LOVE THEM. WE HAVE OVER 1000 PEOPLE OUTSIDE. HUNDREDS IN THE SECOND AUDITORIUM. YOU PEOPLE GOT THE GOOD REAL ESTATE.  THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING TIME. I KNOW IT IS VERY EARLY. THE POLLS HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE ROOF. EVERY ONE OF THEM.  BECAUSE, I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS ME OR THE MESSAGE, OR A COMBINATION, BUT I BROUGHT BACK A TERM THAT HASN'T BEEN USED IN A LONG TIME FOR THE SILENT MAJORITY. THERE IS A TREMENDOUS SILENT MAJORITY THAT POLITICIANS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. THEY HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY LONG ENOUGH. LARGELY INCOMPETENT EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING REELECTED. THAT IS WHAT THEY DO. I HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO EVERYBODY. WHO KNOWS THEM BETTER THAN ME? THEY ARE GREAT AT ONE THING. DON'T MAKE WAVES, SURF IT OUT. GET REELECTED AGAIN. I HAVE BEEN WATCHING IT FOR SO MANY YEARS. I PERSONALLY AM SICK AND TIRED OF IT.  BACKSTAGE I MET SOME OF THE VETS. THE GREATEST PEOPLE WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY.  THEY HAVE BEEN MISTREATED. THEY HAVE BEEN TREATED LIKE THIRD CLASS CITIZENS. IT IS GOING TO STOP.  YOU LOOK AT THE SENATORS AND THE CONGRESSMEN. THEY RIDE AROUND LIKE KINGS. THEY THINK ISN'T THAT GREAT? THEY MAKE SPEECHES. NOTHING HAPPENS. TWO WEEKS AGO, THEY HAD THE LONGEST WAITS IN RECEPTION ROOMS AND RECEPTION AREAS IN THE HISTORY OF THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION. PEOPLE WAITING THREE DAYS, FOUR DAYS, FIVE DAYS TO SEE A DOCTOR. WE ARE GOING TO STRAIGHTEN THAT. IT IS CALLED MANAGEMENT. THAT IS ALL IT IS.  THE MILITARY IS GOING TO BE SO STRONG IN THIS COUNTRY.  NOBODY IS GOING TO MESS AROUND WITH THE UNITED STATES. THAT I CAN TELL YOU. NOBODY.  OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS, JEB BUSH --  IN FAVOR OF COMMON CORE, WEAK ON MILITARY. BUT THE IRAQ WAR WAS A GOOD THING. I'M THE MOST MILITARISTIC PERSON IN THIS ROOM BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHEN TO USE IT. THINK ABOUT IT. WE SPENT $2 TRILLION IN IRAQ. CHINA IS TAKING THE OIL. ISIS MAY HAVE IT AND IRAN MAY HAVE IT BUT CHINA IS TAKING THE OIL. CAN YOU IMAGINE? WE NEVER DO ANYTHING RIGHT WITH CHINA. WE SPENT $2 TRILLION, THOUSANDS OF LIVES OF GREAT PEOPLE, MOSTLY YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, WOUNDED WARRIORS WHO I LOVE ALL OVER THE PLACE, NOT TREATED PROPERLY BY THE WAY.  AND WE HAVE NOTHING. IRAN IS TAKING OVER IRAQ. THE PARTS THEY WANT TO GIVE UP, THEY ARE GIVING OIL TO ISIS. ISIS HAS THE OIL. YOU REMEMBER WHEN I SAID YOU SHOULDN'T GO IN. REUTERS WROTE AN ARTICLE IN 2004 THAT TRUMP, DON'T GO IN. YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN THE BALANCE. IRAN AND IRAQ WERE THE SAME. TWINS. THEY HAVE WARS FOR YEARS. ONE GOES THIS WAY, ONE GOES THAT WAY. IF YOU TAKE OUT ONE, THE OTHER IS GOING TO TAKE OVER. WE TOOK OUT ONE AND LOOK AT THE MESS WE HAVE. WE HAVE DESTABILIZED THE MIDDLE EAST AND IT IS A MESS.  JEB BUSH COULDN'T -- HE DIDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. HE COULDN'T ANSWER A QUESTION, WAS IRAQ A  GOOD THING OR BAD THING? FINALLY AFTER GOING TO HIS POLLSTER, AFTER FIVE DAYS HE SAID IT WAS A BAD THING. THAT'S OK. THE OTHER DAY I'M WATCHING. HE IS SAYING WE GOT SADDAM HUSSEIN OUT, DIDN'T WE? I'M NOT A FAN OF SADDAM HUSSEIN, BUT HE RAN THE PLACE, AND HE HAD NO WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. NOW INSTEAD OF SADDAM HUSSEIN WE ARE FAR MORE BRUTAL. WE HAVE ISIS. WE WILL HAVE IRAN. THEY ARE MAKING DEALS. THE LEADERS OF IRAQ ARE VISITING THE LEADERS OF IRAN. WHAT DO WE GET OUT OF THIS? WE HAVE STUPID LEADERSHIP.  I DIDN'T TO WANT TO GO IN BUT I WAS RIGHT. IT WAS BAD. AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO GO OUT. WE HAVE TO REBUILD THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO REBUILD OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO. OUR BRIDGES ARE FALLING APART. OUR ROADS ARE A MESS. OUR SCHOOLS, OUR HIGHWAYS. EVERYTHING. WHO IS BETTER AT INFRASTRUCTURE THAN TRUMP?  THEY TALKED ABOUT THE SURGE. BUSH'S BROTHER SAID THE WAR IS OVER. TWO DAYS LATER THE WAS A DISASTER. OBAMA SAID THAT WITH YEMEN. HE ANNOUNCED YEMEN WAS A VICTORY. THEN THREE MONTHS LATER IT WAS A DISASTER. WE DON'T HAVE YEMEN. WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. WE SEND OVER TO OUR ALLIES, IF YOU CALL THEM THAT, THERE'S NO WORD FOR THEM. IRAQ ISN'T A COUNTRY. IT IS A CORRUPT PEOPLE THAT STRING SOMETHING TOGETHER. IT IS NOT A COUNTRY. WE SEND OVER TO OUR ALLIES 2500 HUMVEES. SO WHEN I HEARD 2500 I THOUGHT IT WAS A TYPO IN THE NEW YORK TIMES. THEY MEAN 25. THEY MEAN 2.5. THEY MEAN 250, MAYBE. 2500 HUMVEES, ARMOR PLATED. WHEN THE BOMBS GO OFF YOU DON'T LOSE YOUR LEGS AND YOUR LIFE IN YOUR ARMS. GREAT VEHICLES. ONE SHOT IS FIRED AND THESE GUYS RUN AWAY AND THE ENEMY PICKS UP 2500. THINK OF IT. WE NEED THE RIGHT THINKING. I SAID, WHAT A TERRIBLE STATEMENT HE MADE BECAUSE WHEN WE HAD TO LEAVE, YOU CAN TALK ABOUT SURGING BUT AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO LEAVE, WE CAN'T STAY THERE FOREVER. WE WOULD LOOSEN UP THESE RULES. WE HAVE SO MUCH OIL UNDER OUR OWN FEET WE DON'T NEED THEM FOR THOSE THINGS BECAUSE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES.  SO, WE LEAVE AND I SAY LEAVE BUT TAKE THE OIL. DID ANYONE EVER HEAR ME SAY THAT? TAKE THE OIL. I WATCH THESE GUYS ON TELEVISION, POLITICAL PEOPLE, MANY OF THEM WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. I THINK THEY MEAN WELL. THEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE. THEY SAY ISN'T THAT SILLY? HE SAYS TAKE THE OIL. YOU KNOW WHERE IS THE OIL NOW? IRAN AND ISIS. EVERYBODY HAS IT BUT US.  IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE. WE NEED GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR. I THOUGHT HE WAS GREAT. THE HIGHEST ACADEMIC. I WENT TO A REALLY GOOD SCHOOL, YOU HAD TO BE SMART TO GET IN. THAT WAS BEFORE I WAS TRUMP. BUT YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY SMART. THAT IS THE HARDEST ONE. EVEN THEN, BY THE WAY. GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR TO THIS DAY WAS THE GREATEST STUDENTS IN THE HISTORY OF WEST POINT PLUS HE HAD THE LOOK, HE HAD THE WHOLE DEAL. HE WAS A GENERAL. I DON'T SEE IT NOW SO MUCH. I DON'T WANT TO KNOCK THE GENERALS BUT I SEE SOME OF THESE GUYS. CAN WE DEFEAT ISIS? I DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T WANT TO USE NAMES.  THEN YOU HAVE GENERAL GEORGE PATTON.  DO YOU THINK GENERAL PATTON, WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID WE WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CERTAIN CITY AND HE SAID IN TWO WEEKS WE ARE GOING TO ATTACK THIS CITY, AND WE'RE GOING TO ATTACK FROM THE FRONT, AND WE WANT TO USE DRONES. THE ENEMY IS SAYING -- IT IS BRUTAL. IT TURNED OUT TO BE A BRUTAL SITUATION. I SAID THAT IS GREAT. THAT IS CAMOUFLAGE. WHAT A SMART THING HE IS DOING. HE IS PROBABLY GOING TO DO THE OPPOSITE. IT WAS THE CRAZIEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN. SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN 24 HOURS, IT WAS MONTHS. I WONDER WHAT GENERAL MACARTHUR AND GENERAL PATTON ARE DOING NOW IN THEIR GRAVES? SPINNING. SAYING I DON'T BELIEVE IT. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. WE HAVE SUCH A GREAT COUNTRY BUT WE HAVE GONE DOWN SO FAR. CHINA YESTERDAY, I'M BIG IN THE WORLD OF FINANCIAL, CNN DID A POLL, I WAS THROUGH THE ROOF ON THE ECONOMY. I HAVE TO BE ACCURATE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY WILL HAVE A FRONT PAGE STORY THAT I WAS FALSE. I WAS MANY TIMES OVER NUMBER TWO. IT IS A PRETTY IMPORTANT SUBJECT. LEADERSHIP. I KILLED EVERYBODY ON LEADERSHIP. I DID GREAT ON THE MILITARY. I THINK THE MILITARY WOULD BE JUST AS GOOD AS THE ECONOMIC FOR ME PERSONALLY. THESE POOR PEOPLE. I WOULD BE CREATING THINGS THAT NOBODY WOULD BE PLAYING WITH US. NOBODY. NOBODY.  I DON'T NECESSARILY MEAN SOLDIERS. WE LOVE OUR SOLDIERS BUT I MEAN, WE HAVE WEAPONRY THAT IS OBSOLETE. NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 60 MINUTES DOES A SHOW, THEY SHOW HOW BAD A CONDITION OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE IN. DID ANYBODY SEE THAT? CAN YOU -- EVEN IF  IT IS TRUE, WE ARE PUTTING THIS FOR THE WORLD TO SEE. THE REASON THEY DID THAT IS THE PRESIDENT WANTED THE PRESS TO SEE HOW WEAK OUR NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES WERE. THE TELEPHONES DON'T WORK. THEY HAVE WIRES. THE WIRES WERE ROTTING. TO WORK THE TELEPHONES, THE SILOS WERE RUSTING AND ROTTING. THE KIDS SAID WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY WORK. GREAT.  THEY ARE SCREAMING OVER THE PHONE BECAUSE THE WIRES ARE SO DAMAGED AND OLD. THIS IS OUR NUCLEAR. ASSUMING IT IS TRUE, WHO THE HELL WOULD SHOW THAT TO THE ENEMY? THE REASON HE DID WAS BECAUSE HE WANTS FUNDING. WE HAVE TO GET SMART PEOPLE, TOUGH PEOPLE. CHINA. THEY DID THE LARGEST DEVALUATION IN THE HISTORY OF CHINA. THEY THINK THE HISTORY BUT THEY SAY ONLY THE LAST TWO DECADES. NOW I FEEL BETTER. THEY BROUGHT IT DOWN TO TWO DECADES. IN OTHER WORDS, 20 YEARS. OK. WHAT THAT MEANS IS, YOU HEAR THE SUCKING SOUND. JOBS. THAT MEANS MONEY. THAT MEANS ALL OF THIS COMING OUT. THEY DID A NUMBER ON US. WHEN THEY DID THE LAST ONE WHICH WASN'T LONG AGO, IT WAS A MUCH MORE MODEST DEVALUATION, I SAID I CAN'T BELIEVE OBAMA IS ALLOWING THIS TO HAPPEN. WE HAVE ALL THE CARDS. I TOLD THE PRESS IT IS THE GREATEST THEFT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES, WHAT CHINA HAS DONE. WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA. OUR MONEY HAS REBUILT CHINA.  YOU GO OVER TO CHINA, BRIDGES ARE BEING BUILT ALL OVER THE PLACE THAT MAKE THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE AND OTHER BRIDGES LOOK SMALL. I AM NOT USING THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES. I WOULDN'T DO THAT. IT MAKES IT LOOK SMALL TIME. MASSIVE HIGHWAYS, MASSIVE ROADS. I WAS IN DUBAI. GREAT PLACE FOR THEY HAVE AN AIRPORT, IT IS LIKE MAGIC. THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN. YOU GO TO QATAR, YOU GO TO ALL THESE PLACES. WE LAND AT KENNEDY WHERE THEY HAVE HANGERS THAT ARE FALLING DOWN, ROTTING AND RUSTING. IT IS SUCH A SHOCK. WE GO TO KENNEDY. YOU GET USED TO THINGS. WHEN YOUR HOUSE GETS DIRTY. THESE ARE SO BAD, THESE AIRLINES ARE SO SAD. YOU LOOK AT THE AGE OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. LOOK AT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS. EVEN THE AIRPLANES. THEY LIKE QATAR. THEY ASKED ME TO GO TO A DINNER AND I SAID I CAN'T. THEY SAID WE WILL PAY YOU A LOT OF MONEY. IT WAS A LOT OF MONEY TO HAVE A DINNER. LIKE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. I SAID I'LL GO.  YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. YOU CAN BE REALLY RICH, BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO HAVE A DINNER TWO BLOCKS FROM YOUR HOUSE AND YOU DON'T DO IT IT IS TIME TO RETIRE. DO YOU AGREE? I WENT. IT WAS SO AMAZING. I SAID TO THE  MAN OF THE AIRLINE, WHAT IS THE AVERAGE AGE OF YOUR PLANES? HE SAID ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF. THE AVERAGE AGE OF SOME OF OUR AIRLINES, 32 YEARS. 15 YEARS PRE-28 YEARS. AND YOU SEE IT. I SAID HOW DO YOU FINANCE YOUR PLANES. HE LOOKED AT ME LIKE FINANCE? WE DON'T FINANCE. WE PAY CASH. SAUDI ARABIA. I WAS IMPRESSED. IT WASN'T A QUESTION. WHEN I WENT TO QATAR, I WENT INTO AN AIRLINE TERMINAL THAT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TERMINAL I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE MOST MAGNIFICENT. THEY HAD LOUNGES, THEY HAD SPAS. BEFORE YOU GET ON THE PLANE YOU CAN GET A MASSAGE. I'M NOT INTO THAT THOUGH. I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE TOUCHING ME.  IT'S TRUE. THEY HAVE THESE MAGNIFICENT SPAS. I SAID THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AIRLINE TERMINAL I'VE EVER SEEN. HE SAID NO. THIS IS TEMPORARY. OUR NEW ONE IS BEING BUILT OVER THERE. THERE MUST HAVE BEEN 40 CRANES. THIS WAS A TEAR DOWN. WE ARE DOING IT WRONG. SAUDI ARABIA, I HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH SAUDI ARABIA AND MEXICO, AS I DO WITH EVERYBODY. THEY PAY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AM I SUPPOSED TO DISLIKE THEM? CHINA. I SELL APARTMENTS FOR $18 MILLION. SOME OF THE CHEAP ONES ARE $10 MILLION. I DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO SIGN THOSE CONTRACTS. I GET IT FROM SAUDI ARABIA. FROM JAPAN. FROM EVERYBODY. I LOVE THESE PEOPLE. THE PROBLEM IS MEXICO, I LOVE THE MEXICAN PEOPLE. THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS SPIRIT. WHEN I OPENED, TRUMP HAS TAKEN MORE INCOME THAN ANY HUMAN BEING I'VE EVER SEEN. THE PRESS CHANGED MY STATEMENT. THEY USED HALF A SENTENCE. IT TURNED OUT I WAS RIGHT. I WAS TALKING ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. IT TURNED OUT THAT I WAS RIGHT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT SAUDI ARABIA, WHEN YOU LOOK AT MEXICO, THEY ARE TAKING OVER. NABISCO IS CLOSING A FACTORY IN CHICAGO. THEY ARE MOVING TO MEXICO. THIS BIG FACTORY. 1200 JOBS GOING TO BE LOST IN CHICAGO. NO MORE ORIOLES. OREOS. THEY ANNOUNCED. THEY ARE DOING OTHER THINGS. IT IS GREAT. MEXICO. IF YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH IT IT IS GREAT. I HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR THE LEADERS OF MEXICO AND THEIR NEGOTIATORS. I DON'T DISLIKE THEM. THE BIGGEST BANK IN THE WORLD IS A TENANT IN ONE OF MY BUILDINGS. IT IS AN INCREDIBLE BANK. CITIBANK IS A TINY SUBSIDIARY COMPARED TO IT. I NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE RENT. I LOVE THESE PEOPLE. APARTMENTS. WITH MEXICO I HAVE HIRED THOUSANDS OVER THE YEARS, THOUSANDS FROM MEXICO AND LOTS OF OTHER PLACES. THE PROBLEM IS, THEIR LEADERS ARE SMARTER AND SHARPER, AND MORE CUNNING. THEY ARE MUCH MORE CUNNING. THE  WORD CUNNING IS IMPORTANT. THEY KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. THEY ARE WHIPPING US LEFT AND RIGHT. ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES. I COULD MENTION 100. WE DON'T MAKE GOOD DEALS ANYMORE. ONE OF OUR GREAT DEALMAKERS, CARL ICAHN. I HAD DINNER WITH HIM AND SAID CARL, IF I DO THIS, AND I'M DOING WELL, ARE WE LEADING IN EVERY SINGLE POLL?  AND IT IS THE TALK OF POLITICS. IT IS A GREAT HONOR. WE HAVE TO GET THERE. I WAS CALLED BY ONE OF THE BIGGEST JOURNALISTS IN THE WORLD. HE SAID MR. TRUMP, COULD I ASK YOU A QUESTION? HOW DOES IT FEEL? HOW DOES WHAT FEEL?  YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN WITH TRUMP. BELIEVE ME. WITH TRUMP, IT WON'T HAPPEN. THIS GUY --  I HOPE THIS QUESTION IS WORTH IT. THIS GUY HAS BEEN STANDING UP FOR THE ENTIRE THING. I HOPE IT WILL BE A GOOD QUESTION. GO AHEAD.  COME ON. GOT TO GO. GO AHEAD.  IN NUCLEAR PLANTS IN THE UNITED STATES. I'M NOT SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT.  DID I DO THE RIGHT THING? BY THE WAY, HE HAPPENS TO BE RIGHT. YOU DO NOT EVEN HAVE TO TELL ME. I GUARANTEE YOU THAT THEY HAVE SUBSTANDARD PARTS IN NUCLEAR AND AIRPLANES, BECAUSE THEY GET THEM FROM CHINA. WHAT YOU GET FROM CHINA, YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE HELL YOU ARE GETTING. FINISH YOUR QUESTION FAST. THE THE SECURITY --  I GOT TO GO.  I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS GREAT. HE IS TALKING ABOUT COUNTERFEIT PARTS, TO CUT TO THE CHASE. WE DO NOT HAVE TO KNOW WHAT -- THAT YOU ARE IN THE NURSING HOME BUSINESS. ARE YOU TRYING TO TALK TO SOME OF US ABOUT JOINING HER HOME? WE THINK YOUR POINT IS GOOD. GIVE IT TO HIM. GOOD. I'LL READ IT TONIGHT AROUND 1:00 IN THE MORNING INSTEAD OF SLEEPING. IT'S GOOD. GO, SIT. COME ON, COME ON. LET'S GO. WHAT A NICE GUY, RIGHT? HEY, HE MEANS WELL. HONESTLY, HE MEANS WELL. YOU DO. STAND UP. YOU STAND UP. THIS GUY I LOVE. TELL ME, HOW BAD ARE THE VETS BEING TREATED?  THANK YOU SO MUCH. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.  IT CAN'T BE. GREAT QUESTION. IT CANNOT BE JUST INCOMPETENCE. BECAUSE IT IS SO BAD WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE VETS AND THE V.A. IT IS SO BAD THAT IT CANNOT BE JUST INCOMPETENCE. IT IS GOT TO BE THEFT AND A LOT MORE THAN WHAT WE ARE HEARING ABOUT. SO I WOULD DO THAT. THANK YOU.  GO AHEAD. COME ON.  OK. I LOVE IT. THANK YOU.  GO AHEAD. LET'S TAKE. WHO WANTS TO LEAVE? DOES ANYBODY WANT TO WAIT?  I HAVE ALL NIGHT.  HOW ABOUT THE EPA? HOW ABOUT OUR COMMON CORE FOLKS IN WASHINGTON? HOW ABOUT COMMON CORE IN WASHINGTON? RIGHT. GOOD QUESTION. YES, SIR. YOUNG GUY HERE.  MY UNCLE WAS A PROFESSOR AT MIT.  HE IS A SMART GUY. GO AHEAD.  WE HAVE NO VICTORIES. WHEN DID WE BEAT SOMEBODY IN TRADE? WE DO NOT BEAT ANYBODY. >> IN MY INDUSTRY --  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SO MANY VICTORIES  -- YOU WATCH. GO AHEAD.  HONESTLY, I THINK IT IS WONDERFUL. I WANT TO INBUILT -- REBUILD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FIRST. I THINK IT IS WONDERFUL. GO AHEAD. YEAH? GO AHEAD. WAIT FOR THAT MIC. GO AHEAD. JUST SHOUT.  I HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS WHOSE FAMILY IS DEVASTATED BY ALZHEIMER'S. WE CAN GET AN ANSWER. THERE ARE SOME ANSWERS. WE'VE MADE LES PROJECTS -- LESS PROGRESS THE WITH HOPE. YES, MA'AM. YES?  I WONDERED YOU MIGHT SPEAK FROM THE HEART AND TELL US WHAT IS ENDEARING NEW HAMPSHIRE TO YOU?  THE PEOPLE. HONESTLY, I HAVE HAD SUCH A GREAT RESPONSE. SOMEBODY, ONE OF MY FRIENDS, THANK YOU. ONE OF MY FRIENDS WAS ASKING ME WHAT WAS IT LIKE? I HAVE BEEN HERE A LOT. WE HAVE DONE SO MANY TOWN HALLS AND SO DIFFERENT MEETINGS. WE ARE HAVING SO MANY PEOPLE WE NEED -- WHICH WORKED OUT WELL. I AM GOING TO GO SEE THE OTHER AUDITORY WHERE THEY DID NOT HAVE THE GREAT REAL ESTATE. I'M GOING TO SEE THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THAT ARE WAITING TO SEE US.  BUT THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE AMAZING. THEY'RE LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT BUILT THIS COUNTRY. THEY WORK HARD. THEY ARE SMART, INDUSTRIOUS, AND THEY LOVE THIS COUNTRY. THEY WANT TO SEE IT HAPPEN. THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE. I WAS SO HONORED, BECAUSE RECENTLY EVERYBODY SAID THAT A WALKER WOULD WIN IOWA. AND BUSH, WHO'S FALLING LIKE A STONE, BECAUSE HE'S --  TELL ME IS THAT REALLY SO -- THAT IS FROM A DIFFERENT PLANET, RIGHT? I DO NOT GET IT. BUT THEY SAID BUSH HE'S BEING DOWN BIG. AND WALKER, YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WALKER GREW UP A LITTLE IN IOWA. BECAME THE GOVERNOR OF THE ADJOINING STATE. THEY HAVE MASSIVE DEFICITS. THEY HAVE VERY POOR EMPLOYMENT, NEW JOBS. THEY HAVE A LOT OF DISSENSION. A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN WISCONSIN WHICH IS A STATE I LOVE. BUT THEY HAVE A LOT OF PROMISE WITH HER EDUCATION. AND WITH THEIR DEBT. THEY ARE PUTTING UP TREMENDOUS DEBT. I WAS VERY NICE TO WALKER. I GAVE HIM MONEY FOR HIS CAMPAIGN. I GET TO ANYBODY. I GIVE A LOT OF MONEY. HE CAME UP TO SEE ME SIX MONTH AGO. HE GAVE ME A PLAQUE. YOU NEED SOME MONEY?  BUT HE GAVE ME A PLAQUE. IT WAS VERY NICE. AND THEN I WAS VERY NICE TO HIM. I CANNOT BE MEAN TO SOMEONE -- THERE ARE COUPLE OF GUYS RUNNING THAT HAVE BEEN SO NICE TO ME. I WANT TO. ONE OF HIS UNDERLINGS SAID SOMETHING NASTY ABOUT ME. I SAID, FINALLY I CAN TALK ABOUT WISCONSIN. IT WAS SO GOOD. HE PLUNGED IN IOWA. AND I AM LEADING IOWA BIG. WE ARE LEADING NEW HAMPSHIRE BIG. YOU KNOW, WE ARE LEADING NEVADA BIG. WHAT I LOVED ABOUT NEVADA. THEY DID A SECOND PART AT THE POLL. IT CAME OUT LAST WEEK. EVERYBODY WAS IN SHOCK. I WAS NOT BECAUSE I WILL BRING JOBS BACK INTO THIS COUNTRY. I WAS LEADING ALL CANDIDATES IN THE HISPANIC VOTE. EVERYBODY WAS SURPRISED. WHY? I EMPLOY THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF HISPANICS. THEY ARE AMAZING PEOPLE BUT PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED TO SEE THAT. NORTH CAROLINA WE ARE LEADING BY MASSIVE NUMBERS. SOUTH CAROLINA. WE ARE LEADING EVERYWHERE. A POLL CAME OUT 32% NATIONWIDE. ANOTHER ONE 24%, FOX. PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY. THEY ARE TIRED OF BEING RIPPED OFF BY EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD. THEY ARE TIRED OF IT. YOU KNOW --  THE AMERICAN DREAM, WE TALK ABOUT IT. AND I USED THE EXPRESSION A LOT -- THE AMERICAN DREAM. LOOK AT ALL THOSE CAMERAS BLAZING BACK THERE. THIS IS LIVE ALL OVER THE PLACE. ON FOX, ON CNN. I GET UP AND I SPEAK FROM THE HEART. I REALLY DO. LOOK, THERE IS NOTHING. I SPEAK FROM THE HEART. BUT -- BUT A BIG PORTION, NOT ALL OF IT, BUT A BIG PORTION OF THE MEDIA, THE POLITICAL MEDIA IS SO DISHONEST. THEY ARE REALLY DISHONEST PEOPLE. YOU PROBABLY HEARD ME SAY I ALWAYS SAY I LIKE TO SAVE THE AMERICAN DREAM IS DEAD BUT I'M GOING TO MAKE IT BIGGER AND BETTER AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE, OK? I SAY IT ALL THE TIME. THE AMERICAN DREAM IS DEAD BUT I'M GOING TO MAKE A BIGGER, BETTER, STORM OF IT EVER. SO I GO HOME A MONTH AGO. MY WIFE SOME IS SPEAKING ON TELEVISION. AND SHE SAID, DARLING, THAT WAS SUCH A HORRIBLE THING YOU SAID. IT WAS SO NASTY. I SAID, WHAT DID I SAY? YOU SAID THE AMERICAN DREAM IS DEAD. I SAID IT IS DEAD, BUT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A GREAT. SO I TURN ON TELEVISION. I TURN ON TELEVISION AND I SEE IT. IT SAYS, THE AMERICAN DREAM IS DEAD. PERIOD. I SAID, THAT IS TERRIBLE. IT IS DISHONEST. BUT THE FACT IS, A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT IS DEAD. AND IT HAS GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS, NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. BUT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO DO THINGS WITH OUR COUNTRY --  THAT ARE GOING TO BE SO GOOD AND SO SMART AND SO SPECTACULAR. AND WE GOING TO BE RESPECTED BY THE WORLD AGAIN AND NOT LAUGHED IT LIKE WE ARE ALL A BUNCH OF STUPID PEOPLE. IT IS NOT GOING TO GO ON ANY LONGER. WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANY LONGER. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU, AND I LOVE YOU, PEOPLE. I LOVE YOU PEOPLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU.  WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT NO, WE AIN'T GONNA TAKE IT WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE  WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT NO, WE AIN'T GONNA TAKE IT WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE   WAS THAT GOOD?  I WILL.

THANK YOU. FANTASTIC CROWD. REALLY AMAZING. OK, QUESTIONS? KATIE?  I AM OK WITH WORKING WITH CUBA, BUT WE SHOULD HAVE MADE A MUCH STRONGER DEAL. FOR HE HAD THEM IN A POSITION WHERE WE COULD HAVE DONE MUCH BETTER. THE DEAL IS A NEUTRAL DEAL AND COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER. THE CONCEPT OF OPENING UP IS OK, BUT WE SHOULD HAVE MADE A MUCH BETTER, STRONGER DEAL. YES.  WELL, I SAID THAT IN A VERY SARCASTIC FASHION. IT IS HELPING CHINA BECAUSE CHINA IS DOING LITTLE ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING. THIS COUNTRY HAS GONE OVERBOARD. YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED THE OTHER DAY WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA'S BILL. IT WILL PUT COSTS OUT OF CONTROL, AND WE HAVE TO COMPETE WITH CHINA AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. CHINA LOVES WHAT WE ARE DOING ON GLOBAL WARMING, THAT I CAN TELL YOU. YOU GO OVER TO CHINA AND SEE WHAT THEIR FACTORIES ARE DOING. THEIR FACTORIES ARE DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAVING TO DO WITH GLOBAL WARMING, AND THEY WON'T FOR MANY YEARS. CHINA IS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE BETWEEN THE DEVALUATIONS WHICH I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT WITH SOME OF THE --SOMEBODY WHO REALLY KNOWS THE SUBJECT. THE DEVALUATIONS AND THE WHOLE THING GLOBAL WARMING, CHINA IS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR COMPANIES TO COMPETE. WE HAVE TO GET SMART IN THIS COUNTRY AND FAST. YES, MA'AM.  WE SPENT $2 TRILLION IN IRAQ. WE LOST THOUSANDS OF LIVES IN IRAQ. WE HAVE WOUNDED WARRIORS WHO I LOVE ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY AND BEYOND. OK? WAS IT WORTH IT? WE HAVE NOTHING OVER THERE. HIS BROTHER MADE A HORRIBLE DECISION, AND PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE A HORRIBLE DECISION THE WAY HE LEFT. WHEN HE LEFT, HE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE OIL INSTEAD OF GIVING IT TO ISIS AND ENRON. -- IRAN. YOU KNOW THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IS? CHINA IS TAKING OUT THE OIL. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE IN. ONCE YOU WENT IN, YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE -- I MEAN YOU GO IN, YOU NEVER WON. BUT WHAT A MISTAKE IRAQ WAS. I HEARD JEB BUSH TALKING ABOUT IT. FIRST OF ALL, IT TOOK IN FIVE DAYS BEFORE HE COULD GIVE AN ANSWER. AFTER THE POLLSTERS TOLD HIM WHAT TO SAY, HE SAID IT WAS BAD. NOW HE IS TRYING TO BACKTRACK, PROBABLY BECAUSE HIS BROTHER SAID YOU'RE KILLING ME, YOU SAID IT IS BAD. THAT IS MY LEGACY, THE IRAQ WAR. IRAQ WAR IS A DISASTER FOR THE BUSHES. THE LAST THING WE NEED IS ANOTHER BUSH, BELIEVE ME. SADDAM HUSSEIN, INSTEAD OF HIM, YOU HAVE ISIS. INSTEAD OF HIM, YOU HAVE IRAN TAKING OVER. SO YOU TELL ME, WAS IT WORTH WHAT WE PAID FOR? YES, SIR. >>   I SAID THEY ARE TERRIBLE. NOT DESTROYED, BUT THEY ARE PRETTY WELL DESTROYED. I THINK I WOULD HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA AND PUTIN.  IT DEPENDS. THEY HAVE TO BEHAVE ALSO. I THINK I WOULD GET ALONG VERY WELL WITH PUTIN. I KNOW MANY OF THE PEOPLE. I HAD A MAJOR EVENT THERE TWO YEARS AGO IN MOSCOW, AS YOU KNOW. IT WAS A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. WE HAD AN AMAZING SUCCESS, AND I THINK I WOULD GET ALONG VERY WELL WITH PUTIN. I THINK I WOULD GET ALONG WITH THE LEADERS OF THE WORLD VERY WELL, MANY OF THEM, NOT ALL OF THEM. THE ONES I DON'T GET ALONG WITH WILL HAVE TO PAY. WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN, AND WE ARE NOT DOING IT. WE ARE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. WE ARE GOING LIKE THIS. WE ARE A LAUGHINGSTOCK ALL OVER THE WORLD. OK? YES, SIR. GO AHEAD.  NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS A HUGE HEROIN PROBLEM. PER CAPITA, THE BIGGEST IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY. NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS A HUGE YEAR WHEN PROBLEM -- CAROLYN -- HEROIN PROBLEM. EDUCATION, WORKING HARD. YOU HAVE TO GET PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM. IT STARTS WITH OXYCONTIN FROM WHAT I AM HEARING. YOU HAVE TO EDUCATE AND DO SOMETHING VERY STRONG. BUT IT DOES HAVE A BIG PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN HEARING IT FROM EVERYBODY. BIGGER PER CAPITA THAN ANY PLACE ELSE. YES, MA'AM.  IT WILL BE VERY SOON. I HAVE SOME OF THE MOST BRILLIANT PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WORKING ON TAX, WHICH I AM INVOLVED IN VERY MUCH BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM VERY WELL, PROBABLY BETTER THAN ANYBODY THAT HAS EVER RUN FOR OFFICE IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH, BECAUSE I AM PART OF THE SYSTEM. WE HAVE SOME AMAZING PEOPLE WORKING ON IMMIGRATION, SO I WOULD SAY OVER THE NEXT TWO OR THREE WEEKS. PROBABLY SOMETIME DURING SEPTEMBER.  UKRAINE IS A PROBLEM. AT SOME POINT, DON'T YOU THINK THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE SHOULD BE MORE INVOLVED THAN THEY ARE? WE ARE LEADING ALL OF THESE FIGHTS. UKRAINE IS A BIG PROBLEM. GERMANY IS A RICH, POWERFUL COUNTRY. ECONOMICALLY, FROM IT IS OUR -- TREMENDOUS POWER. UNBELIEVABLE ECONOMIC POWER. WHY ISN'T GERMANY? DO WE HAVE TO LEAD EVERY FIGHT? UKRAINE IS A PROBLEM, AND WE SHOULD HELP THEM. BUT LET GERMANY AND OTHER COUNTRIES DIRECTLY AFFECTED, LET THEM WORK IT. WE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO REBUILD OUR COUNTRY. CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DRAINED US. CHINA HAS CREATED THE GREATEST THEFT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IT IS THE GREATEST THEFT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES, THE MONEY THEY HAD TAKEN OUT FROM US. IT IS A ONE-WAY STREET. SO, WE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS. WE BACK OUR FOLKS, AND WE BACK OUR FRIENDS. AND WE WANT THEM TO STRAIGHTEN OUT UKRAINE. I WANT TO SEE IT STRAIGHTENED OUT ALSO. BUT DON'T YOU THINK GERMANY AND THOSE COUNTRIES DIRECTLY AFFECTED SHOULD BE FIGHTING? IT IS ALMOST LIKE THEY DON'T EVEN CARE. THEY DON'T EVEN CARE. I THINK I WOULD GET ALONG GREAT WITH HIM. WHO KNOWS? WHAT I THINK I WOULD GET ALONG GREAT WITH HIM, THE MAN. HOW ARE YOU?  RAND PAUL, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, IS A DISASTER IN THE POLLS. HE IS A DISASTER ON MILITARY AND DEFENSE. HE IS GETTING DECIMATED BY EVERYBODY. OTHER THAN GIVING HIM A LOT OF MONEY FOR AN EYE CENTER AT HIS REQUEST, HE SAID, COULD I HAVE MONEY? I SAID YES BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH IT. A LOT OF MONEY FOR AN EYE CENTER WHICH IS HYPOCRITICAL WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. OTHER THAN GIVING HIM A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR HIS EYE CENTER, WHICH I'M HAPPY ABOUT BECAUSE I'M SURE THEY DO GOOD WORK, I HOPE THEY DO GOOD WORK. HE IS DOING SO BADLY HE FIGURES HE HAS TO ATTACK TRUMP BECAUSE I AM LEADING BY WHAT EVERYWHERE. I DON'T MIND. I THINK HE IS NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT. CAN'T MAKE IT. GOT THE WRONG MESSAGE. I MEAN, THIS IS NOT A TIME TO BE WEAK ON DEFENSE. I AM THE OPPOSITE. I WANT TO MAKE OUR MILITARY SO STRONG, SO POWERFUL, SO GREAT THAT NOBODY IS GOING TO MESS WITH US. I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS WHO ARE TREATED LIKE THIRD CLASS CITIZENS. TWO WEEKS AGO ON WEDNESDAY, OUR VETS, AS YOU KNOW AND PROBABLY REPORTED ON IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE A BIG PROBLEM HERE WITH THAT'S -- VETS NOT TAKING CARE OF PROPERLY, OUR DEBTS HAVE THE LONGEST WEEK IN THE HISTORY OF THE V.A., WAITING FOR DOCTORS IN ROOMS. THEY WAIT FOR OR FIVE OR SIX DAYS. IN ONE CASE, THEY WAITED FIVE DAYS AND THE DOCTOR SAID SORRY, I'M GOING ON VACATION NOW. OUR POLITICIANS, ALL TALK, NO ACTION. THEY ARE ALL THE SAME. OUR POLITICIANS HAVE LET THE VETS DOWN. RAND PAUL HAS LET THE VETS DOWN. I DON'T BLAME HIM. HE'S DOING SO POORLY IN THE POLLS. I HAVE BEEN ATTACKED BY PERRY OF TEXAS. AND HE WENT BING LIKE A ROCKET SHIP IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. I WAS ATTACKED BY LINDSEY GRAHAM. HE HAD TWO POINTS. NOW HE HAS ZERO. RAND PAUL HAS VERY FEW POINTS, BUT I THINK HE IS GOING DOWN, TOO. RAND PAUL IS USING THE PEOPLE OF KENTUCKY. EITHER RUN FOR SENATE AND DO A GOOD JOB OR RUN FOR PRESIDENT. YOU DON'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT, AND BY THE WAY IF I DON'T MAKE IT, I WILL BECOME YOUR SENATOR RELUCTANTLY. IF I  GOOD. DID YOU HEAR THAT? IT TAKES OVER THREE YEARS TO PROCESS ONE VETERANS CLAIM. I THINK THEY HAVE RUN OUT OF COMPETENCE. THEY HAVE INCOMPETENT PEOPLE RUNNING IT. IT STARTS WITH OUR SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN AND OUR PRESIDENT. I RUN THINGS PROPERLY. WHAT I RUN RUNS PROPERLY. ONE OF THE THINGS I WILL DO IS TAKE CARE OF OUR VETERANS. IT IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT. YOU ARE A PERFECT EXAMPLE. THREE YEARS TO PROCESS A CLAIM THAT SHOULD TAKE 24 HOURS? YES, MA'AM.  MARTY WALSH IS A CLOWN. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO HE IS. HE SPENDS ALL THIS TIME AND EFFORT AND MONEY ON AN OLYMPIC BID AND THEN HE GOES OUT AND TALKS ABOUT ICE BUCKET CHALLENGES. GET A REAL MAYOR. HE CAME OUT AND HE WAS STRONGLY AGAINST -- WHEN WE HAD THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM, AS YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS TOTALLY MISQUOTED. NOW, EVERYONE HAS APOLOGIZED TO ME. HE SAID I DON'T LIKE TRUMP'S STATEMENTS. NOW, EVERYONE IS APOLOGIZING BECAUSE I TURNED OUT TO BE RIGHT. YOU HAD BEAUTIFUL KATE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND MANY OTHERS, EVEN A FEW DAYS AGO, A 63-YEAR-OLD WOMAN -- A 66-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WAS RAPED, SODOMIZED, AND TORTURED BY AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT AND THEY CAUGHT HIM. IT'S JUST DISGRACEFUL WHAT IS GOING ON. I AM SO PROUD OF IT, I BROUGHT UP -- AND I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT THAT FIRST WEEK, WE CAN DO HALF. NOW, SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE APOLOGIZED TO ME. IT HAS BECOME A MAINSTAY OF EVERYBODY'S CAMPAIGN. THE PROBLEM IS, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. I DO. I KNOW HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND ITS ROOTS WITH BUILDING A WALL -- AND IT STARTS WITH BUILDING A WALL. YES, SIR. I DON'T THINK HE SAID THAT. JEB BUSH SAID THAT ON WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES, HE WON'T FUND THEM. ARE YOU OK?  JEB BUSH SAID THAT ON WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES, HE WON'T FUND THEM. WHOSE PHONE WAS THAT? ARE YOU READY? JEB BUSH SAID THAT ON WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES, HE WON'T FUND THEM. THEN HE SAID, I MISSPOKE, I AM SO SORRY. I CHERISH WOMEN. WOMEN WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF BETTER WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP THEN ANYONE ELSE, REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT. YOU CAN LOOK AT MY COMPANY, I HAVE MANY WOMEN EXECUTIVES. THEY MAY, IN MANY CASES, MORE MONEY. -- MAKE THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLE EXECUTIVES. I THINK THEY ARE PAID MORE. WE ARE STUDYING IT RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE PHENOMENAL. THEY ARE INCREDIBLY TALENTED. YEARS AGO, IN TURGID MAJOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, I HAVE HAD WOMEN IN CHARGE. -- IN CHARGE OF MAJOR GOVERNOR BAKER SHOULD ONLY DREAM ABOUT DOING FOR WOMEN WHAT I HAVE DONE AND WHAT I WILL DO. ON THE WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUE, THERE WILL BE NOBODY THAT ARE THAN DONALD TRUMP. WHATEVER IT TAKES. YES, MA'AM. BERNIE SANDERS HAS GAINED A LOT OF TRACTION. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR REAL CHANGE. OBAMA SAID THEY ARE LOOKING FOR CHANGE AND LOOK WHAT WE GOT. WE GOT CHANGE. THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY HAVE. BERNIE SANDERS IS NOT GOING TO END UP BEING THE STANDARD, BUT CERTAINLY HE AND I ARE GIVING -- GETTING THE BIGGEST CROWDS. WE HAVE 2500 PEOPLE AND A THOUSAND PEOPLE OR MORE THAN THAT ARE STANDING OUTSIDE LISTENING TO MICROPHONES. AND LOUDSPEAKERS. WE HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS CROWDS. I HAD 15,000 IN PHOENIX. EVERY CROWD IS A RECORD. EVERY CROWD IS TOTALLY SOLD OUT. HE HAS DONE THE SAME THING ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH A VERY DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY TO PUT IT MILDLY. >>   I BUILT A NET WORTH OF MORE THAN $10 BILLION. I HAVE BEEN A WORLD CLASS BUSINESS MAN. I HAVE SOME OF THE GREAT ASSETS OF THE WORLD. I DON'T SAY THAT IN A BRAGGADOCIO'S WAY. THAT IS THE THINKING THAT OUR COUNTRY NEEDS TO TAKE OUR JOBS BACK FROM CHINA AND JAPAN AND MEXICO AND CLEAN UP THE BORDER. SPEAKING OF MEXICO. THAT'S THE KIND OF THINKING WE NEED TO TAKE BACK OUR JOBS, BRING BACK OUR MONEY, OUR MANUFACTURING. YOU TAKE A LOOK AT CHINA, WHAT THEY HAD DONE. I HAVE TAKEN OUR MONEY, JOBS, BASE, MANUFACTURING, AND WE OWED THEM $1.4 TRILLION. THAT'S LIKE A MAGIC ACT. THEY HAD TAKEN EVERYTHING AND WE OWED THEM MONEY. RIGHT NOW, CHINA, $1.4 TRILLION. THEY GET EVERYTHING AND WE OH -- OWE THEM MONEY BECAUSE WE ARE LED BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A CLUE HERE IT I THINK WE ARE LED BY STUPID PEOPLE. I DON'T THINK THEY ARE BAD PEOPLE. I THINK THEY ARE VERY STUPID PEOPLE. OUR LEADERS DON'T HAVE A CLUE. THEY ARE INCOMPETENT. CHINA IS A GREAT EXAMPLE. I MET WITH CARL ICAHN AND I HAD DINNER WITH HIM TONIGHT TO GO. I SAID CARL, IF I DO THIS, I AM GOING TO PUT YOU IN CHARGE OF CHINA AND I'M GOING TO ADD IN JAPAN. YOU KNOW WHAT? EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE JUST FINE FOR US. WE HAVE PEOPLE NEGOTIATING FOR US THAT HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THEY ARE NOT EVEN BUSINESS PEOPLE. REMEMBER THIS, BUSH AND HILLARY AND ALL THESE PEOPLE, THEY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. THEY RAISE MONEY FROM MY FRIENDS, I USED TO BE ONE OF THEM. THEY ARE ALWAYS THERE FOR ME. BUT THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY. JEB HAS RAISED $114 MILLION APPROXIMATELY. EVERYBODY THAT PUTS MONEY UP FOR JEB BUSH, IT'S LIKE HE IS A PUPPET. HE IS TOTALLY CONTROLLED BY THESE PEOPLE. JEB BUSH IS CONTROLLED BY THE PEOPLE THAT PUT UP THE MONEY. SO ARE THE OTHER CANDIDATES. I DON'T WANT MONEY FROM PEOPLE. OTHER THAN SMALL DONATIONS BECAUSE I HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE -- ONE WOMAN SENT SEVEN DOLLARS. I LOVE THAT WHERE THEY INVEST IN MY CAMPAIGN. I DON'T WANT THAT FOR THE MONEY, I WANT THAT BECAUSE PSYCHOLOGICALLY I THINK IT'S GREAT. JEB BUSH HAS $114 MILLION. WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO WITH IT? HE WILL START HITTING ME WITH ADS I GUESS. HE HAS TO BECAUSE HE IS GOING DOWN THE TUBES. THERE IS NO ENERGY. WHEN JED AND HILLARY AND ALL OF THESE OTHER CANDIDATES START SPENDING MONEY, REMEMBER THIS. THAT MONEY WAS GIVEN BY PEOPLE THAT HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER THEM. THOSE PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM I KNOW VERY WELL, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT HIM, ABOUT THE COLOR OF HIS HAIR, THEY DON'T CARE ANYTHING ABOUT HIM. AND THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE COUNTRY IN MANY CASES. THEY ONLY WANT WHATEVER THEY WANT AND THEY WILL GET PLENTY. YES, SIR.  THEY SHOULD RELEASE THE NAMES OF THE DONORS. I THINK WE SHOULD BE MUCH MORE OPEN. IF SOMEBODY CONTRIBUTES A LOT OF MONEY, WE SHOULD KNOW WHO THOSE PEOPLE ARE. IT'S NOT A GREAT DECISION FOR ME AND THEY ARE FRIENDS OF MINE. I AM PUTTING UP MY OWN MONEY. HERE YOU HAVE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE MONEY INTO OTHER CAMPAIGNS WHERE THEY WILL HAVE TOTAL CONTROL. 100%, KATIE, THEY WILL HAVE CONTROL OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE RUNNING FOR OFFICE. ONE OF THE REASONS I HAVE DONE SO WELL IN THE POLLS IS BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS I WILL NOT BE CONTROLLED. I WILL DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE COUNTRY. NO LOBBYISTS. I KNOW ALL OF THE LOBBYISTS. THEY ARE VERY GOOD. BUT WHEN THEY GIVE A MILLION DOLLARS OR $5 MILLION TO JEB BUSH, THEY HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER HIM. HE WILL DO WHATEVER THEY SAY. WITH ME, THERE IS NONE OF THAT. I LOVE THE IDEA OF CAMPAIGN FINANCING. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SHOULD DO IS EVERYBODY SHOULD BE KNOWN. IF SOME BUT HE GIVES A MILLION OR 2 MILLION OR 5 MILLION, IT SHOULD BE KNOWN. I WILL TELL YOU, THIS NONSENSE WITH PACKS WHERE THEY HAVE $100 MILLION RAISED AND THEY DON'T CORDON IT WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE, I MEAN, BUSH PUTS HIS BEST FRIEND IN THERE. THEY ARE NOT A LOT TO TALK. DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN? THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK. THEY PLAY GOLF ON SATURDAY, BUT THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE HUNDRED MILLION AND WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO INVEST. COME ON. WE ARE NOT BABIES. IT IS A SHAME. IT IS A DISGRACE. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE, IF YOU PUT MONEY UP, YOU CAN PUT MONEY INTO EITHER OR BOTH HERE AND DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. THERE HAS TO BE TRANSPARENCY. YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHERE THE MONEY IS COMING FROM AND THAT WOULD HELP.  I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE CONCEPT OF A WOMAN RUNNING WITH ME IS FABULOUS. IT'S TOO SOON TO SAY. THERE IS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON HILLARY RIGHT NOW. IT HAS BEEN BRUTAL FOR HER. I THINK AT SOME POINT, SHE IS PERHAPS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO RUN. SHE WILL HAVE TO AND HER CAMPAIGN. THAT SEEMS TO BE THE THINKING BY SO MANY. I WAS SAYING THAT TWO MONTHS AGO AND EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WASN'T RIGHT. IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE -- THIS IS TOP-SECRET STUFF. GENERAL PETRAEUS'S LIFE WAS DESTROYED. WITH A TINY FRACTION OF WHAT SHE HAS DONE. IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO HIM IF THEY ARE GOING TO DESTROY HIM OVER DOING BY COMPARISON NOTHING, I DON'T SEE HOW SHE CAN RUN. I THINK SHE HAS MUCH BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN RUNNING FOR OFFICE. YES, MA'AM. HOW MUCH LONGER? LAST QUESTION. WE WILL DO TWO MORE QUESTIONS. I DON'T THINK DONATIONS WHEN PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHO IS DONATING ARE GOOD. I THINK THE CONCEPT THAT -- CONCEPT OF DONATIONS, PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW WHO IS CONTRIBUTE IN. DON'T FORGET, WHILE I AM PRINCE -- FRIENDS WITH CITIZEN UNITED, AND I THINK THE HEAD IS A GREAT GUY, THAT DOESN'T HELP BECAUSE I'M SPENDING MY OWN MONEY. ON A PERSONAL BASIS, I DON'T LOVE IT. I THINK THERE SHOULD BE BETTER TRANSPARENCY AND I THINK WHEN THE MONEY COMES IN, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE IT TO DO WHAT YOU WANT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY DO ANYWAY. EVERYBODY DOES IT, UNFORTUNATELY, NOT US, BECAUSE I AM NOT DOING IT. THESE CANDIDATES ARE DOING IT ILLEGALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE TELLING THE PEOPLE THAT ARE RUNNING THE PACKS EXACTLY WHAT TO DO. IF ANYBODY THINKS THEY ARE NOT, THEY ARE CHILDREN. I WILL BE DOING JURY DUTY ON MONDAY MORNING. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? I KNEW YOU WOULD ASK ME THAT QUESTION, CANDY. IN NEW YORK CITY. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S ONE OF THE COURTS. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. I THINK IT'S FUN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WILL SEE YOU. ARE WE GIVING HELICOPTER RIDE? I THINK SO. I HOPE SO, TO THE KIDS. THANK YOU.","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump News Conference in Hampton, New Hampshire"

IT WILL BE VERY EXCITING FOR THE KIDS AND WE HAVE QUITE A FEW CLIPS HERE TODAY. WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN? GET THEM OVER HERE. I LOVE CHILDREN. I LOVE IOWA. I HAVE REALLY DEVELOPED A RELATIONSHIP AND IT IS AN AMAZING PLACE.          NOBODY WILL DO THE JOB THAT I WILL DO. I WILL BRING BACK JOBS, STRENGTHEN THE MILITARY, TAKE CARE OF BETS, GET RID OF OBAMACARE. LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING. LOOK WHAT IS HAPPENING. THE COSTS OF YOUR INSURANCE IS GONE TO THE ROOF. LOOK WHAT IT IS HAPPENING. IT IS TERRIBLE. I WILL TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE IN IT WILL BE BETTER TO WOMEN. THERE IS ANOTHER THING I HEARD WITH JEB. WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES. THEN HE GOES BACK TO HER THREE HOURS LATER AND SAID HE MISSPOKE. I WILL BE SO GREAT TO WOMEN. I CHERISH WOMEN AND WOMEN HAVE NOT BEEN TAKING CARE OF PROPERLY. WHEN I HEAR SOMEBODY LIKE JEB BUSH TALKING ABOUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO FIND -- AND THEN HE COMES BACK.'S POLLSTER SAID YOU MADE A MISTAKE, TAKE IT BACK. BUT HE DOES NOT MEAN IT FROM THE HEART. ANOTHER QUESTION.  IT WILL COME OUT TOMORROW ON ""MEET THE PRESS."" I JUST PUT OUT A POLICY ON IMMIGRATION I THINK IS VERY COMPREHENSIVE. TAX POLICY WHICH I HAVE TO BE VERY GOOD AT. WHO KNOWS THE SYSTEM BETTER THAN ME? I'M PUTTING OUT A TAX POLICY OVER THE NEXT YOU WEEKS. WE ARE PUTTING THEM OUT ONE BY ONE. I THINK YOU WILL SEE THAT IT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR NICE WORDS.  I THINK THE PRESS IS MORE EAGER TO SEE IT THAN THE VOTERS. I THINK THEY LIKE ME AND THEY UNDERSTAND THE AND THINK I WILL DO THE JOB. WHEN YOU PUT OUT A POLICY LIKE A 14 POINT PLAN, A LOT OF TIMES IN THE FIRST HOUR OF NEGOTIATION THAT 14 POINT PLAN GOES ASTRAY. BUT YOU MAY COME UP WITH A BETTER DEAL. THAT IS HOW LIFE WORKS. WHEN I DO A DEAL I DO NOT SAY HERE'S 14 POINT. I GO OUT AND DO IT. I DON'T TALK ABOUT 14 POINTS. I KNOW THE PRESS WANTS IT. I DON'T THINK THAT PEOPLE CARE. I THINK THEY TRUST ME. THAT IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT. I HAVE BEEN GETTING POLITICIANS TO PASS WHATEVER IT WANTED ALL MY LIFE. NOBODY HAS MORE EXPERIENCE. NOBODY IS MORE EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH POLITICIANS. I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THEM ALL MY LIFE. WHETHER IT IS BIG NEW YORK CITY ZONING DEALS WHICH ARE PROBABLY TOUGHER THAN MOST OF THE THINGS I WILL BE DEALING WITH WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES. I BUILT A CITY ON THE WEST SIDE OF MANHATTAN. TALK ABOUT GETTING ZONING. GETTING ZONING FOR TRUMP TOWER, 68 STORIES ON 57TH. I'VE BEEN GIVEN WITH POLITICIANS ALL MY LIFE. THEY ARE FINE. THEY ARE WONDERFUL. THEY ARE ALL TALK AND NO ACTION. THEY ARE SELLING THIS, COUNTRY DOWN THE TUBES AND THEY ARE EASY TO DEAL WITH BELIEVE ME.  THAT PAPER WAS NOT RELEVANT TO ME. AND A NOTICE ANOTHER -- A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOT SPEAKING THERE. YES, I'M TAKING QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW. AM I GOING TO TAKE QUESTIONS? SHE JUST ASKED IF I'M GOING TO TAKE QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS. AM I TAKING QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS? THEY WILL TELL YOU I'M TAKING QUESTIONS.   UNLIKE HILLARY, DO WE AGREE? GO AHEAD.   I HAD NOT HEARD THAT. I GUESS THAT IS A CONSUMMATE IN MANY WAYS. -- COMPLEMENT IN MANY WAYS. YES, GO AHEAD.  YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE ME IN TERMS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. WE ARE BUILDING A WALL. IT WILL BE A WALL. NOBODY IS GOING THROUGH MY WALL. TRUMP BUILDS WALLS. WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL. IT WILL BE STRONG AND SOLID AND THE LEAST -- POLICED. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS FLY A DRONE OVER IT. THEY CAN SEE THAT IMMEDIATELY. NOBODY CAN GO UNDER, NOBODY'S GOING OVER IT, AND WE ARE GOOD OF A BIG DOOR FOR PEOPLE TO COME AND LEGALLY. WE WILL HAVE A BIG DUTIFUL DOOR -- BEAUTIFUL DOOR FOR PEOPLE TO COMMIT LEGALLY. I WANT PEOPLE TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY BUT THEY HAVE TO COME IN LEGALLY. YOU WILL BE VERY HAPPY WITH ME. YEAH?  I THINK EVEN BETTER. FOREIGN LEADERS -- I'VE HAD GREAT RELATIONSHIPS OVER THE YEARS. I HAD GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS. I THINK EVEN BETTER. I AM LEADING IN EVERY POLL. THE BIG ONES AND LITTLE ONES. I AM LEADING IN IOWA BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AT SCOTT WALKER, ESTATE HAS A $2.2 BILLION DEFICIT. HE WAS TELLING PEOPLE'S GROWTH IS TERRIBLE -- IN TERMS OF THE STATE. THEIR INSTRUMENT IS DISSENSION ALL OF THE STATE BUT THEY SAID THEY WILL HAVE A BIG SURPLUS OF $1 BILLION. IT'S A $2.2 BILLION DEFICIT. NOBODY WAS WILLING TO SAY IT BUT ME. AND I DID NOT WANT TO SAY IT. I WOULD NOT HAVE SAID IT UNTIL HE ATTACKED ME. THEN I SAID THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I SET IT.  I GET ALONG GREAT WITH THEM. I'M BUILDING WHEN CHINA -- IN CHINA. A BUILDING ALL OVER THE WORLD. WHY, DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GETTING LONG GOOD RIGHT NOW? PUTIN CAN'T STAND OBAMA. WHO LIKES OBAMA? I AM TALKING WORLDWIDE. HE IS NOT GETTING ALONG WITH ANYBODY. HILLARY CLINTON WAS THE SINGLE WORST SECRETARY OF STATE IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. THE WORLD COLLAPSED AROUND US WHILE SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE. IN MY OPINION, KERRY MIGHT BE WORSE BECAUSE HE IS MAKING A DEAL WITH IRAN THAT IS SO BAD AND SO DANGEROUS AND SO INCOMPETENT AND STUPID THAT IT WILL HAVE GRAVE CONSEQUENCES. GRAVE CONSEQUENCES.  VERY FORCEFUL ACTION. YOU CANNOT LET IRAN -- LET ME TELL YOU THIS. NOR CAN ISRAEL. ISRAEL SOLD EPICUREAN OBAMA. YOU CANNOT LET IRAN HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPON. WHEN THEY MARCHED ON THE STREET SAYING ""HAVE TO ISRAEL, DEATH TO UNITED STATES."" IT CANNOT HAPPEN. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN HERE.  IRRELEVANT. I MAKE $400 MILLION A YEAR. WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? I WANT TO MAKE THE COUNTRY GREAT. THAT IS ALL IT WANT TO DO. MY BUSINESS HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL. MY CHILDREN AND MY EXECUTIVES WILL RUN THAT EASILY. I WON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. MY SOLE PURPOSE WILL BE TAKING THE BRAIN THAT BUILT A GREAT BUSINESS WITH SOME OF THE GREAT ASSETS OF THE WORLD, I HAVE SOME THE GREAT ASSETS IN THE WORLD. BEST LOCATIONS IN MANHATTAN. TRUMP TOWER, 57TH AND FIFTH. THAT IS WHAT I DO WHATEVER IT IS. WHATEVER KIND OF A BRAIN THAT IS WILL BE USED TO MAKING OUR COUNTRY RICH AGAIN, TRADE DEALS. GREAT TRADE DEALS. MAKING OUR COUNTRY RICH. AND THEN MAKING IT GREAT. WE CANNOT MAKE IT GREAT UNLESS WE MAKE IT -- WE NEED THE MONEY. WE OF $19 TRILLION. MY WHOLE FOCUS WILL BE THIS COUNTRY AND MAKING IT GREAT.  I WOULD IF I HAD TO.  YES, I DO. I HAVE EXCEPTIONS AND I'VE BEEN OPEN ABOUT THAT.  I DON'T THINK I HAVE MADE MISTAKES. THEY DO THE POLLS IN MY NEVER GO UP. WHEN I SAID MEXICO, I WAS TALKING ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. THE PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD IT EVEN THOUGH THE PRESS DID NOT WANT THEM TO. WHEN I TALK ABOUT JOHN MCCAIN I WAS SAYING HOW BAD HE TREATED VETERANS. THEY ARE TREATED BADLY. THAN THEY DO A POLL. MCCAIN OR TRUMP? AND I SWAP THEM IN THE POLLS. THE VETERANS LIKE ME BETTER BECAUSE THEY KNOW I WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM. AFTER 30 YEARS HE IS NOT TAKING CARE OF THEM. AND THIS LAST THING WITH FOX. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK ROGER WHO WON. I DO NOT THINK I HAVE MADE ANY MISTAKES. I'M SURE I WILL AT SOME POINT, BUT SO FAR YOU HAVE TO SAY AS A WORK OF BADLY? RIGHT. REPORTED IS NOT WANT TO GIVE ME AN ANSWER.  DID YOU RUN A PROFILE? THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN. SHE IS FANTASTIC. >> WHAT KIND OF THINGS WILL YOU DO DIFFERENTLY FOR THIS COUNTRY?  ALMOST EVERYTHING. WHAT THINGS IN MY CANDIDATE DIFFERENT FOR THIS COUNTRY? ALMOST EVERYTHING, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN. EVERYTHING WE DO IS WRONG. THE MILITARY, WE ARE NOT TAKING CARE OF THE MILITARY OR OUR VETS. WE ARE NOT TAKING CARE OF OUR COUNTRY, OUR FINANCES. WE'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF OUR TRADE DEALS. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW THIS COUNTRY HAVE A VICTORY? WE DO NOT HAVE VICTORIES. WE DO NOT HAVE VICTORIES AGAINST CHINA IN TRADE. CHINA JUST DEVALUED THEIR CURRENCY. THAT IS THE SUCKING SOUND. THAT MEANS JOBS AND MONEY COMING OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. WHAT THEY DID WITH THAT EVALUATION, THE BIGGEST DEVALUATION THAT HAD INTO DECADES, THEY ARE KILLING US. THEY WILL NOT BE DOING IT WHEN I AM WATCHING. I THINK OUR PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS HAPPENING. DO YOU AGREE WITH ME? DOES EVERYBODY AGREE WITH ME?  LET'S GIVE THEM A HELICOPTER RIDE. COME ON, IT WAS GOING FIRST? WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS? KIDS, GET ALL LINED UP.   LET'S GET A PICTURE OF EVERYBODY. GET IN THE PICTURE.",Presidential Candidate Donald Trump at the Iowa State Fair

HOW ARE YOU? YES MA'AM?  I THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS GOING TO DO WELL. YOU HAVE ANOTHER PARTY THAT HAS PROBLEMS. I JUST SAW IT COMING OVER, THE E-MAIL SITUATION FOR HILLARY IS A BIG PROBLEM. IF THEY JUDGE IT FAIRLY, SHE HAS A BIG PROBLEM. NO, NOT AT ALL. I HAVE BEEN PROVEN RIGHT. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY BEEN PROVEN RIGHT.   I DON'T THINK SO AT ALL. I CAN ONLY GO BY THE POLLS, 32%. THAT IS THE HIGHEST FOR ANYBODY YET. I CAN ONLY GO BY THE POLLS. THE PEOPLE WE ARE DEALING WITH, IT IS WHAT IT IS. YOU LOOK AT THE RESULTS. IOWA CAME OUT A LITTLE WHILE AGO. LEADING IN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE, NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA. NEVADA. LEADING EVERYWHERE. THAT IS ALL I CAN GO BY. EXCUSE ME? THAT IS THE BEST QUESTION. CHINA. CHINA. I THINK YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO REIN IN CHINA. THE D VALUE TO THEIR CURRENCY AND ARE MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE U.S. TO COMPETE. CHINA HAS NO RESPECT FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA WHATSOEVER. YOU HAVE TO TAKE STRONG ACTIONS. HOW CAN WE COMPETE? THEY CONTINUOUSLY DEVALUE THEIR CURRENCY. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEARS. THIS WAS THE LARGEST DEVALUATION THEY HAVE HAD IN TWO DECADES. THEY ARE MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR BUSINESSES TO COMPETE. THEY THINK WE ARE RUN BY A BUNCH OF IDIOTS. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH CHINA IS UNBELIEVABLE. THE LARGEST DEVALUATION IN TWO DECADES. A GREAT QUESTION. IT IS A DISGRACE. MAJOR, FANTASTIC. I WATCHED YOU WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA TWO WEEKS AGO. HE WAS NOT THRILLED. I'M SURE I WILL BE MORE THRILLED.   VERY FAIR QUESTION. YOU COULD HAVE LET IT REBUILD ITSELF, GO BANKRUPT. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT IS THE WAY IT SHOULD HAVE GONE. I COULD HAVE DONE IT EITHER WAY. I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE ENDED UP ULTIMATELY IN THE SAME PLACE. YES MA'AM? RACE RELATIONS ARE AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH OR LOW? THAT, CERTAINLY.  JOBS, SPIRIT. THERE'S NO SPIRIT. CERTAINLY, I WOULD. IN TERMS OF HOW TO ADDRESS -- THEY ARE DOING POORLY, YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON IN EVERY PLACE. YOU HAVE POWDER CAKES. YOU NEED SPIRIT AND YOU NEED JOBS. WE NEED TO TAKE JOBS BACK FROM CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN OUR JOBS. THAT IS WHY WHEN THE QUESTION WAS ASKED ABOUT CHINA, IT IS TERRIBLE. MORE JOBS ARE GOING TO GO. YES, MA'AM?   I THINK WE ARE GOING TO DO WELL WITH A LOT OF VOTERS. THE HISPANIC VOTE. THE WOMEN VOTE. IF YOU LOOK IN NEVADA, THEY DID THE POLL. I AM LEADING THE HISPANIC VOTE BECAUSE I CREATE JOBS. I WILL BE CREATING TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF JOBS. WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES, I AM FOR THAT. I WATCHED JEB BUSH GIVE THE WORST ANSWER THE OTHER DAY. THAT IS GOING TO BE HIS 47%. ROMNEY POSSIBLY LOST THE ELECTIONS FOR MANY REASONS, BUT ONE REASON WAS 47%. I THINK JEB'S ANSWER ON WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES THE OTHER DAY WAS A DISASTER FOR HIM. HE SAID HE MISSPOKE. HOW DO YOU MISSPOKE? I WILL BE GREAT ON WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES. I CHERISH WOMEN. I WILL BE GREAT ON WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES, BELIEVE ME. OH, HELLO, DAVID.  HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING.  YOU DID NOT BRING UP ISIS.  WHEN YOU ARE COMING UP WITH A PLAN, YOU HAVE TO BE FLEXIBLE. I RECENTLY GOT SOMETHING IN MIAMI, EVERYBODY WANTED IT. IF I HAD SAID, HERE IS A 12 POINT PLAN, I DID NOT DO THAT. I WENT IN AND PUNCHED IN BEAT THE HELL OUT OF PEOPLE AND I ENDED UP GETTING IT. ALL THE SMART MONEY WANTED IT. THE OLD POST OFFICE. EVERYBODY WANTED IT. I GOT IT. IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, I GOT IT WHICH IS SHOCKING. I GOT IT. I GOT IT BECAUSE I KNOW HOW TO GET THINGS DONE. YOU CANNOT SIT DOWN AND SAY, WELL, I'M GOING TO COME UP WITH A 19 POINT PLAN TO GET THE OLD POST OFFICE AND TURN IT INTO A GREAT HOTEL. THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER PROPERTY IN THE HISTORY OF THE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION. TRUMP GOT IT. I AM NOT AN OBAMA PERSON. YOU HAVE TO HAVE FLEX ABILITY.  THERE HAS TO BE A TRUST. IF YOU DO NOT TRUST, YOU WILL NOT DO WELL.   JEB BUSH DOES NOT HAVE -- HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AGAINST CHINA. HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AGAINST MEXICO. JEB BUSH WITH MEXICO SAID PEOPLE COME IN, IT IS AN ACT OF LOVE. IT IS NOT AN ACT OF LOVE. WE NEED A WALL. YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. IF IT WERE NOT FOR ME, THEY WOULD NOT EVEN BE TALKING ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN FRANCISCO, YESTERDAY IN CALIFORNIA, WHICH WAS HORRIBLE. THE WHOLE SITUATION WITH JEB BUSH, HIS ACT OF LOVE, IT IS NOT WORKING. I TOOK A LOT OF HEAT AND THEN PEOPLE REALIZED I WAS RIGHT AND APOLOGIZED TO ME. WE ARE GOING TO BE ANNOUNCING NUMBERS AND SPECIFICS, KNOWING THAT WHAT I JUST SAID IS RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO BE FLEXIBLE ON JOBS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. I WILL BE SPEAKING ABOUT IT LATER. WE WILL BE TAKING JOBS AWAY FROM CHINA, AWAY FROM ALL THESE COUNTRIES STEALING FROM US. THEY ARE STEALING OUR BASE, MONEY, MANUFACTURING. WE WILL BRING THEM BACK TO THE U.S.  FORWARD, AS AN EXAMPLE, IS BUILDING A $2.5 BILLION PLANT IN MEXICO. HOW DOES THAT HELP US? I WENT TO THE WHARTON SCHOOL OF FINANCE. IF THEY ARE SPENDING $2.5 BILLION TO BUILD A CAR PLANT IN MEXICO. CARS AND PARTS ARE GOING ALL OVER THE U.S., BUT THEY ARE COMING INTO THE U.S., NO TAX. HOW DOES THAT HELP US EXCEPT THEY ARE CLOSING PLANTS IN MICHIGAN. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BRINGING BACK JOBS TO THE U.S. YES, SIR?   10 YEARS AGO, EVERYBODY WANTED THE WALL. THEY COULD NOT GET IT. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE REASONS? ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENTS. THERE WERE TOADS. WE ARE GOING TO GET THE WALL BUILT. IT IS GOING TO BE BUILT RIGHT. MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL. IN MEXICO IS MAKING A FORTUNE OFF THE U.S. MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE WALL AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE HAPPY ABOUT IT. THE COST OF THE WALL IS PEANUTS COMPARED TO THE KIND OF MONEY THEY ARE MAKING. MEXICO IS BECOMING THE NEW CHINA. I HAVE A GREAT LOVE FOR MEXICO. I HAVE A LOVE FOR THE MEXICAN PEOPLE. I HAVE THOUSANDS OF MEXICAN PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS THAT HAVE WORKED FOR ME. THOUSANDS. THEY ARE FANTASTIC PEOPLE. BUT THERE POLITICIANS AND LEADERS ARE SMARTER AND SHARPER AND MORE CUNNING. THEY ARE MORE CUNNING THAN OUR LEADERS. THEY WILL PAY FOR THE WALL, THEY WILL BE HAPPY ABOUT IT, THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO WELL BUT NOT AS WELL AS THEY ARE DOING RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE TAKING TOO MANY OF OUR JOBS.   THIRD-PARTY. THAT COULD HAPPEN. YOU KNOW, THAT COULD HAPPEN. IN THE DEBATE, IT CAME OUT ON ONE OF THE NETWORKS TODAY. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN 2 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHING. THAT HAS BEEN SORT OF STANDARD. THERE ARE 24 MILLION PEOPLE. IT IS GOING TO GO TO 28-29 OR 30. WHO DO YOU THINK THEY ARE WATCHING, JEB BUSH? I DON'T THINK SO. YOUI DON'T THINK SO. I HOPE NOT. I WANT TO RUN AS A REPUBLICAN TO READ THAT IS WHAT I AM DOING AND I AM LEADING IN EVERY POLL. THE LOCAL AND NATIONAL POLLS AND BY SUBSTANTIAL MARGINS. I HOPE I WILL BE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE BECAUSE THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO WIN. I WILL KEEP THE DOOR OPEN IF I'M NOT TREATED FAIRLY. THE WORD IS FAIRLY, NOT WELL. IF I'M NOT TREATED FAIRLY, WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I WAS PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT. I IS LET ME EXPLAIN. I WAS THE ESTABLISHMENT TWO MONTHS AGO. I WAS THE FAIR-HAIRED BOY, A BIG GIVER. ONCE I DECIDED TO RUN, I AM A SEMI-ANTIESTABLISHMENT. NOW LEADING IN THE POLLS, THEY ARE TREATING ME WELL. ME AND THERE ARE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TERRIFIC. AND THEY ARE DEALING WITH MY PEOPLE. WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP. YOU I WANT TO RUN AS A REPUBLICAN, I DON'T WANT TO RUN AS A THIRD PARTY OR INDEPENDENT. AS LONG AS I AM TREATED FAIRLY, THAT IS GOING TO BE THE CASE. YOU ARE FAIRLY IS AN INSTINCT. YOU I WANT FAIR. YOU KNOW WHAT FAIR IS. YOUYOU KNOW WHAT FAIR IS. I KNOW WHAT FAIR IS. I THINK THAT IS HAPPENING. ARE WIN, LOSE, OR DRAW, I'M NOT SAYING I HAVE WIN. YOU MIGHT IF I WIN THE NOMINATION, I GUARANTEE YOU I WILL NOT RUN A THIRD-PARTY YOU WILL NOT RUN A THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE. ONE MORE QUESTION? YES. WILL YOU I WOULD NEVER GIVE UP MY MICROPHONE. I THOUGHT THAT WAS DISGUSTING. THAT SHOWED SUCH A WEAKNESS. THE WAY HE WAS TAKEN AWAY BY TWO YOUNG WOMEN, THEY JUST TOOK THE WHOLE PLACE OVER. THE AUDIENCE, WHICH LIKED HIM, THEY ARE SAYING, HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN? THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN WITH ME. I FELT BADLY FOR HIM. IT SHOWED HE IS WEAK. YOU KNOW WHAT? HE IS GETTING THE BIGGEST CROWDS AND I'M GETTING THE BIGGEST CROWDS. BUT BELIEVE ME, THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO TRUMP. YES? YOU COULD WIN IT. YOU ARE WAY OUT IN FRONT. I AGREE.   YOU WANT TO BE VICE PRESIDENT? HE HAD GREAT CREDIBILITY UNTIL HE SAID THAT. ONE MORE.  100%,  MARK IT DOWN. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU. WE WILL GO MAKE A SPEECH AND THEN YOU GO HOME. HAVE A GOOD TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump News Conference in Birch Run, Michigan"

I WILL SAY A FEW WORDS AND HE WILL SAY A FEW WORDS. THE MAYOR HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB. MR. MAYOR?  THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. IT HAS BEEN AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE. X GO IS BOOMING. THEY HAVE DONE AND -- MEXICO IS BOOMING. THEY HAVE DONE AN AMAZING JOB. MEXICO IS DOING SO WELL, BEYOND WHAT EVERYONE THOUGHT. DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS? I HAVE THOUSANDS OF MEXICANS AND HISPANICS. I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU SAW THE BILL, BUT THEY DID A BIG HOLE IN THE STATE OF NEVADA AND I AM WAY AHEAD. AND FOR IMPORTANTLY, I AM AHEAD WITH THE HISPANICS, WELL INTO THE 30'S. I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF HISPANICS. MANY WORK FOR ME AND THE RELATIONSHIP IS GOOD.  HOW MANY KILLED?  THEY COME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD -- I AGREE WITH THAT.  THERE IS A HUGE DANGER ON THE BORDER WITH THE ILLEGALS COMING IN. I HAVE HEARD IT FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE. IN FACT, AS YOU KNOW, BORDER PATROL INVITED ME. MOST OF YOU HAVE THAT INVITATION. THE BORDER PATROL AND INVITED ME AND CANCELED BECAUSE FRANKLY, THEY DO NOT WANT TO GET INVOLVED. THE REASON THEY INVITED ME WAS BECAUSE OF THE TREMENDOUS PROBLEM AND ALL OF THE THINGS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THEY INVITED ME, AND THEN AT THE LAST MOMENT -- AND WORK, VIRTUALLY IN THE AIR -- AND THEY SAID, WE CANNOT GET INVOLVED. THE BIG THOSE ORDERS FROM WASHINGTON.  WE WILL BE SHOWING YOU THE EVIDENCE.  WE JUST LANDED. WE SAW A LOT OF PEOPLE WAVING FLAGS SAYING, THEY ARE IN FAVOR OF WHAT WE ARE DOING. ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE AT THE AIRPORT MADE ME FEEL VERY, VERY HONORED.  THEY WERE CHANTING FOR ME. I DID NOT SEE THOSE CHANTING AGAINST ME. MEETING THE MAYOR WAS AMAZING. HE IS DOING AN AMAZING JOB. I AM GOING TO STEAL HIM TO RUN SOMETHING FOR ME. HE IS FANTASTIC -- THE CITY MANAGER.  THIS IS ONE SECTION, BUT THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT.  THERE IS A HUGE PROBLEM WITH THE ILLEGALS COMING THROUGH. IN SOME SECTIONS IT IS A MASSIVE PROBLEM. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THOSE COMING IN -- THEY HAVE TO BE LEGAL. YOU HAVE TO LET THE BORDER PATROL DO THEIR JOB. YOU HAVE TO LET THEM DO THEIR JOB. THAT IS WHY THEY INVITED ME. I DID NOT COME HERE. BORDER PATROL INVITED ME. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB. IF THEY CANNOT IT DO THEIR JOB, THEY ARE UNHAPPY.  YES, THERE HAS TO BE A WALL. YES, DEFINITELY IN CERTAIN AREAS ESPECIALLY, THERE MUST BE A WALL.  I AM A REPUBLICAN AND CONSERVATIVE. I WANT TO RUN AS A REPUBLICAN. I THINK I WILL GET THE NOMINATION. THE BEST WAY TO WIN IS FOR ME TO GET THE NOMINATION AND RUN PROBABLY, AGAINST HILLARY. HILLARY IS THE WORST SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. SHE IS GOING TO BE BEATEN, AND I WILL BEAT HER. THE REASON I WON WITH THE HISPANIC VOTE AND I HAVE ONE ALL OVER WITH THE HISPANIC VOTE, I WILL TAKE BACK JOBS FROM CHINA AND JAPAN. I WILL BRING THE JOBS BACK AND THE HISPANICS WILL GET THOSE JOBS. THEY WILL LOVE TRUMP EVEN MORE THAN THEY ALREADY DO.  NO, THEY WERE NOT INSULTED.","Presidential Candidate Donald Trump News Conference in Laredo, Texas"

I GREATLY  APPRECIATE  IT. AN  AMAZING  PLACE  AND  A  FANTASTIC CROWD. SO,  WHEN WAS  THE LAST TIME  YOU HAVE  SEEN OUR  COUNTRY  WIN  AT ANYTHING? WE  DON'T  WIN  ANYMORE. TRUE. THAT IS  TRUE. WE  DON'T  WIN  ANYMORE,  WHETHER IT IS  ISIS OR  CHINA  WITH  OUR  TRADE AGREEMENTS. NO MATTER  WHAT  IT  IS,  IT  SEEMS THAT  WE  DON'T  SEEM  TO  HAVE  IT. WE  MAKE  FIVE TO ONE DEALS. WE GET KILLERS  THAT  ARE  NOW LEADERS THAT  ARE  ALL  BACK  IN FIGHTING US. THESE  ARE  THE  KIND  OF  DEALS  WE. THE NUCLEAR DEAL  IS  A  DISASTER. THIS  IS GOING TO  LEAD TO  NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION ALL  OVER. YOU  WILL  HAVE  NUKES,  COUNTRIES FIGHTING  LIKE  HELL  TO  GET THEM. ALL  BECAUSE  WE  HAVE  PEOPLE IN THEIR  THAT  ARE EITHER INCOMPETENT  OR  THERE  IS SOMETHING  MAYBE  EVEN  WORSE  GOING ON. I HAPPEN  TO  THINK  THEY  ARE INCOMPETENT GOOD  YOU LOOK  AT WHAT  IS  HAPPENING,  YOU  LOOK  AT WHAT  IS  HAPPENING  EVERYWHERE  IN OUR  COUNTRY. OUR  REAL UNEMPLOYMENT  RATE,  YOU KNOW  THAT IS  NOT  5.6%. IT  IS REALLY PROBABLY  19%  TO 21%. I AM BUILDING  BUILDINGS, AND  I'M BUILDING  MANY  OF  THEM. EVERY  TIME I  GO  TO  A  JOB  AND PEOPLE  KNOW I AM  THERE,  I  HAVE HUNDREDS  OF PEOPLE  AT  THE STREET,  THEY  WANT TO  SEE  ME. THEY  WANT  TO  BE  PART  OF  IT. THEY  WANT  TO  KNOW,  CAN THEY  GET A  JOB. THAT IS NOT 5%  AND  5.6%. THE REAL NUMBER  IS  ASTRONOMICAL. YOU  LOOK  AT  WHAT IS  GOING  WITH THE VARIOUS  THINGS  THAT  ARE COUNTRY IS DOING  AND  THEN  YOU HEAR  POLITICIANS  AND  ALL  YOU HEAR IS  ALL  TALK,  NO  ACTION. AND  I AM ACTUALLY  DISAPPOINTED WITH  A  LOT  OF  THE  REPUBLICANS. YOU  HEAR  SOMETHING,  WHETHER IT IS  OBAMACARE  WHICH  IS A DISASTER  ,  WHICH  HAS TO  BE  REPEALED  AND REPLACED,  WHETHER IT  IS --    WHETHER IT IS  WE ARE  GOING  TO CUT  SOCIAL  SECURITY  BECAUSE  THAT IS  WHAT  THEY  ARE  SAYING. EVERY  REPUBLICAN  WANTS TO  DO  A BIG NUMBER ON -- BECAUSE  THE REPUBLICANS AND THE  DEMOCRATS DON'T  KNOW  HOW  TO  BRING  JOBS BACK  TO  OUR  COUNTRY. IF  I  RUN  AND  I WILL WIN,  I  WILL BRING JOBS  BACK. BELIEVE  ME. WE  WILL  BRING  THEM  BACK FROM CHINA,  WHERE THEY  ARE  RIPPING  US LIKE  YOU HAVE  NEVER  SEEN. YOU  KNOW,  CHINA JUST  DID  A  BIG CUT  ON  THE  CURRENCY. THEY  ARE KNOCKING  THE HELL,  THEY ARE  MANIPULATING IT  TO  A  LEVEL THEY  HAVE NEVER  DONE  BEFORE. THEY  ARE  DOING  IT. AND  IT  IS  TAKING  TREMENDOUS BUSINESS  AWAY  FROM THE  U.S.. AND  WHAT  THEY  ARE DOING  IS  THEY ARE  MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE  FOR  OUR COMPANIES  TO  COMPETE. IMPOSSIBLE. A  FRIEND  OF  MINE,  AND AS  YOU KNOW,  JAPAN IS BACK,  IS A  TURKIC GUY. AN  EXCAVATOR. AND  HE  WENT OUT  AND  HE  CALLED  ME THE  OTHER DAY. HE  IS  VERY UPSET. I  SAID  WHAT  IS  YOUR  PROBLEM? HE  SAID  I  JUST  PUT IN  A  HUGE ORDER FOR KOMATSU  TRACTORS. I  SAID  WHY  DID  YOU  DO  THAT? HE SAID  BECAUSE  JAPAN HAS  SO STRONGLY  DEVALUED THE YEN  THAT IT IS  IMPOSSIBLE FOR  CATERPILLAR TO  COMPETE. AND  HE WAS VERY,  VERY  SAD. AND  HE  IS  GOING TO HAVE  NOW KOMATSU. A BIG  PROBLEM. ANOTHER  FRIEND  OF MINE,  GREAT GUY,  A TAKE  MANUFACTURE -- THEY TALK  ABOUT  FREE  TRADE. THERE  IS  NO  FREE  TRADE. IT  IS  A  DISASTER IF  YOU  HAVE STUPID  PEOPLE  OR INCOMPETENT PEOPLE. WHICH  IS  WHAT  WE  HAVE. SO  A  FRIEND OF  MINE,  A  BIG MANUFACTURE,  HE GOES  OUT  AND  HE IS TRYING  TO  GET  BUSINESS WITH CHINA. HE  SAYS,  IT  IS  IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE I  CAN  GET  MY PRODUCT INTO  CHINA. AND  THEY WANT  TO  CHARGE  A  HUGE SURTAX. IT  IS  GOING  TO  BE LIKE  MASSIVE, LIKE  42%. I  SAID,  DOES  THE WORLD  KNOW THIS? WHAT  CHINA IS  DOING  IS INCREDIBLE. WHAT  MEXICO,  THE NEW  CHINA,  IS DOING TO  THIS  COUNTRY  AT  THE BORDER,  WHERE  IT  IS LIKE  PEOPLE POURING ACROSS,  WHAT  MEXICO  IS DOING  IS  OUTRAGEOUS.   FORD MOTOR'S JUST  ANNOUNCED  A TWO  AND  A  HALF BILLION  DOLLAR PLAN  IN  MEXICO. THEY  MAKE THE CARS,  THEY  EMPLOY MEXICANS,  AND THEY  SEND  THEM OVER  TO  OUR  COUNTRY. NO  TAX,  NO  NOTHING. THAT  MEANS WE  AND  I  GOING  TO MAKE  THOSE CARS  IN  OUR  COUNTRY. TWO  WEEKS AGO,  THE FRONT PAGE  OF THE ""WALL STREET  JOURNAL,""  BIG STORY, MEXICO  TAKING  A  BIG  CAR PLANT AT  OF  TENNESSEE. IT  WAS  GOING  TO GO TO  TENNESSEE, A  GERMAN  COMPANY,  IT  WAS  ALL SET,  THEN OUT  OF  THE  BLUE  MEXICO SWIPED  IT. THEY  GIVE  THEM ALL  SORTS  OF THINGS. AND  NOW  IT  IS BEING  BUILT  IN MEXICO. MORE PEOPLE  EMPLOYED. THEN  THEY  TREAT US  LIKE  GARBAGE AT  THE  BORDER. THEY  LAUGH  AT  US. THEY  LAUGH  AT  US. SO,  MEXICO,  YOU HAVE  TO  BE  VERY CAREFUL  WITH  BECAUSE MEXICO  IS TREATING  US  LIKE  A  BUNCH OF BABIES  BECAUSE WE  ARE  LED  BY PEOPLE  THAT  TRULY DON'T  KNOW WHAT  THEY  ARE  DOING. THEY  ARE RANK  AMATEURS --    THEY  ARE RANK  AMATEURS  AND I WILL  SAY  THIS. WHETHER IT  IS THANK  OZZY, WHETHER IT IS IRS,  WHETHER  IT  IS ANY  OF  THE MANY  THINGS YOU  SEE THAT  HAVE  GONE  WRONG  WITH OUR COUNTRY,  THE  EXECUTIVE ORDERS ARE AN  OUTRAGE, WE  HAVE  A PRESIDENT  WHO  CAN'T  LEAD. HE  SAID  THE  HELL WITH IT,  I CAN'T  DO THIS ANYMORE IT  THIS GUY  HAS  PLAYED  HUNDREDS OF ROUNDS  OF  GOLF. I  SHOULDN'T  COMPLAIN. I  OWN  GO  COURSES  ALL OVER  THE WORLD,  SO I  SHOULDN'T  BE  ANGRY AT  HIM. IT IS  GOOD. EXCEPT  IT  IS NOT GOOD  BECAUSE  HE SHOULD  BE  DOING  OTHER  THINGS. BUT  HE  SIGNS EXECUTIVE  ORDERS BECAUSE  HE  HAS GIVEN  UP. HE CAN'T  CONVINCE  ANYBODY TO  DO ANYTHING,  SO  HE  HAS GIVEN  UP  AND HE  SIGNS  ON  IMMIGRATION AND OTHER THINGS GOOD  WE HAVE  A -- AND  OTHER  THINGS. WE  HAVE  A  COURT SYSTEM  THAT  IS PRETTY  MESSY. A  REAL,  REAL  PROBLEM. SO  I  KNOW  YOU  HAVE PEOPLE RUNNING. AND  I HAVE DONE REALLY  NICELY  IN THE  POLLS  WHEN THEY  PUT  ME  AND POST  BUT  EVERYBODY THINK  OFF -- THANKS, OH,  TRUMP  IS  NOT RUNNING. THEY  THINK  I  HAVE  A  WONDERFUL LIFE. WHY  WOULD  I  RUN? I  MEAN, THEY  THINK  HE  IS  HAVING A  GOOD  TIME. THIS  IS NOT FUN. BELIEVE ME,  I  LOVE  YOU  PEOPLE. IT'S  GREAT, BUT  I'M  NOT  HAVING  A GOOD  TIME. I  COULD THINK  OF  MANY  OTHER THINGS WERE  AND  COULD  HAVE  A GOOD  TIME. I  LOVE  MY COMPANY  PAID  I  HAVE A TERRIFIC  TIME --  COMPANY. I  HAVE  A TERRIFIC  TIME  RUNNING IT. BUT  I  HAVE CHILDREN  THAT COULD TAKE  OVER  AND  I  HAVE  EXECUTIVES THAT  A  GREAT  AND  COULD  RUN THAT COMPANY. POLITICIANS  ARE  NEVER  GOING  TO SOLVE  THE --     -- A MINIMUM  100,  AND  I  WILL BUILD  YOU  THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BALLROOM YOU  HAVE  EVER  SEEN.  -- NOT  THAT  WE  SHOULD  BE HONORING THE  PEOPLE  FROM  CHINA BECAUSE THEY  DO  NOTHING BUT  RIP US  OFF,  BUT  LET'S  USE THEM  AS  AN EXAMPLE.   I  SAID  I  WAS BENT  OVER $100 MILLION  AND  I  WILL  BUILD  IT  FREE OF  CHARGE. YOU  CAN  PICK  THE  ONE YOU  LIKE. I  NEVER  HEARD  FROM THEM. THAT  IS  THE  WAY  IT IS. NEVER  HEARD  FROM  THEM. SO  THAT IS  EMBLEMATIC OF  THE  WAY OUR COUNTRY  IS. THAT IS  EMBLEMATIC  OF THE WAY  IT IS GOING  TO  BE  FOR  A  LONG  TIME IF WE  KEEP  HAVING  POLITICIANS IN THERE. SO,  JUST TO  FINISH  AND A  COUPLE OF  QUESTIONS. BUT  IF I DECIDE  TO  RUN, AND  I THINK  I  WILL  SURPRISE A  LOT  OF PEOPLE,  A  LOT OF  PEOPLE,  IF  I DECIDE TO  RUN, AND  IF I  WIN,  I THINK  WE  WILL  HAVE  A  GREAT CHANCE. A  GREAT  CHANCE. I  WILL  MAKE THIS  COUNTRY  GREAT AGAIN. BELIEVE ME. AND  NO  POLITICIAN IS  GOING  TO  DO IT. THAT  I  CAN TELL  YOU WITH  SURETY. YOU  CAN  FORGET IT  BECAUSE POLITICIANS  ARE ALL  TALK  AND  NO ACTION. I  HAVE  DONE WITH  THEM  ALL  MY LIFE. IT  IS REALLY  EASY  TO  MAKE  MONEY AGAINST POLITICIANS. BELIEVE  ME. AND  WE WILL  MAKE  THIS  COUNTRY GREAT  AGAIN. LET'S HAVE  A  COUPLE  OF QUESTIONS. THANK  YOU. THANK  YOU.   THANK  YOU.   THANK  YOU  VERY MUCH.   OK, YES  MA'AM? SURE,  WE  HAVE A  MIC  FOR  YOU. GO  AHEAD.  >> THANK  YOU. I  WOULD  JUST LIKE  TO  KNOW  IF  YOU THINK YOU  CAN  BEAT  HILLARY CLINTON. MR. TRUMP: I  DO. I  KNOW  HILLARY  VERY  WELL. I  CAN  BEAT  HER  AND  I  THINK  MOST OTHER  PEOPLE  WILL  NOT. I WILL  BE  HONEST  WITH  YOU,  I LIKE MITT  ON  THE. HE  IS  A  NICE PERSON. BUT  I  WAS  VERY,  VERY DISAPPOINTED AT  THE  PERFORMANCE OF  MITT ROMNEY  BECAUSE  THE  LAST MONTH HE  DISAPPEARED. I  CALLED AND SAID,  WHY  AREN'T YOU OTHER  THERE  IN  THE  RAIN SHAKING HANDS  WITH  GOVERNORS? OR  IN SOME  CASES,  KISSING GOVERNORS,  RIGHT? BUT  SHAKING  HANDS WITH GOVERNORS,  WHY  AREN'T  YOU DOING IT? AND  HE SAID WELL, BLAH BLAH  AND HE  DIDN'T  DO  IT. AND  OBAMA,  GIVE HIM CREDIT,  HE WAS  ON  JAY  LENO, DAVID LETTERMAN,  EVERY  SHOW. AND  MITT  ROMNEY  WASN'T. I  REMEMBER SEAN  HANNITY WAS TELLING  ME, GOOD  GUY,  TELLING  ME I  CAN'T  GET ROMNEY  ON  THE  SHOW. HOW  CAN YOU  NOT  GET  HIM  ON  THE SHOW? BUT  HE  COULDN'T  GET  HIM  ON  THE SHOW. I  WAS VERY,  VERY  DISAPPOINTED  IN MITT ROMNEY  BECAUSE  SOMETHING HAPPENED. IN  SPORTS,  THEY  CALL  IT  TO  THEIR CHILDREN. THAT  IS  WHY WHEN MID  WAS THINKING  ABOUT RUNNING, EVERYBODY  SAID,  HE IS  NOT  GOING TO  RUN. I SAID,  REALLY? I  KNEW  HE  WAS  GOING  TO  RUN. I  DIDN'T  WANT  HIM  TO RUN  BECAUSE HE  CHOKED  AND  YOU  CAN'T ALLOW THAT  TO  HAPPEN  AGAIN. IF I  GOT THE  NOMINATION,  I  WOULD PUT  UP A  FIGHT  LIKE  NOBODY  HAS EVER PUT  UP  BECAUSE  WE  HAVE  TO SAY  THE  COUNTRY. OUR  COUNTRY  IS  IN  DEEP  TROUBLE. THANK  YOU. WE  ALL $18 TRILLION,  IT  WILL SOON  BE $22  TRILLION. WHEN IT  HITS $24  TRILLION,  THAT IS THE  $24 TRILLION  IS  THE  POINT  OF NO RETURN. IT  WILL  BE  VERY  HARD TO  COME BACK. WITH HILLARY,  IT  IS  BASICALLY FOUR MORE  YEARS  OF  OBAMA. YOU CANNOT  ALLOW  IT  TO  HAPPEN AGAIN.  >> HI, MR.  TRUMP. THE QUESTION  I HAVE  IS --  YOU DON'T  CARE MUCH  FOR  POLITICIANS. DONALD:  I  LIKE  THEM. I  MAKE  A  FORTUNE  OFF POLITICIANS.  >> IF  YOU  ARE  GOING  TO  LOOK  FOR A RUNNING  MATE,  WHERE  WOULD  YOU LOOK FOR  A  RUNNING MATE? DONALD:  I  WOULD  PROBABLY PICK  A POLITICIAN.  >> IN  YOUR,  I  ASSUME  YOU WOULD GO  WITH  BUSINESSMAN. DONALD:  GREAT  QUESTION. WE  HAVE  PEOPLE  NEGOTIATING FOR US  WHO  ARE  DIPLOMATS AND  BEST NEGOTIATION IS  A  GREAT  ART. WE  HAVE  PEOPLE THAT  DON'T  HAVE  A CLUE. CAROLINE KENNEDY,  I  SAW  HER  ON 60 MINUTES, IT  WAS  AN AMAZING THESE  BECAUSE  THEY  SAID, HOW  DID YOU  GET  THIS  JOB? SHE SAID,  WELL,  I  WAS LOOKING FOR  SOMETHING  AND  I  WENT TO  THE WHITE  HOUSE  AND  I  ASK, DO  YOU HAVE  ANYTHING? HOW  WOULD  YOU  LIKE  TO BE  THE AMBASSADOR  TO  JAPAN? SHE  SAID,  REALLY? COULD  I DO  THAT? I'M  NOT  KNOCKING HER. I  THINK  SHE  IS  NICE. SHE  IS  A  GOOD  FRIEND. YOU  VODKA LIKES  HER -- IVANKA LIKES  HER. SHE  IS  NOT  TALENTED AT  WHAT  YOU HAVE  TO  DO. I  SEE  ALL  THE  PEOPLE FROM JAPAN  -- I'VE  DEALT  WITH  THESE  PEOPLE A  LONG  TIME. THE  BIGGEST BANKS  IN  THE  WORLD ARE  IN  MY  BUILDING. I  DEAL  WITH  THE CHINESE. I  MADE  A  FORTUNE. I  MADE  A FORTUNE AGAINST  CHINA. NOT WITH,  AGAINST. I SEE  ALL  THESE  GUYS  AND  ON  60 MINUTES, THEY  ARE  PUSHING  HER AROUND. THEN  SHE  TALKS ABOUT TRADE. SHE  DOESN'T  KNOW  ANYTHING ABOUT TRADE. WHAT  I  WOULD  DO, I  WOULD  GO  TO WALL  STREET. I  KNOW  ALL THE  KILLERS  ON  WALL STREET. I KNOW  THE GREAT  ONES,  THE ONES THAT  ARE HIGHLY OVERRATED  LIKE SOME OF  THE MEDIA  IS  OVERRATED AND  SOME  ARE GREAT  AND  SOME  ARE TERRIBLE. I  KNOW  ALL THE  GREAT DEAL PEOPLE. THERE ARE  PLENTY  THAT  ARE OVERRATED. I  KNOW  THE  BAD  ONES. I  KNOW  THE BEST. SOME  OF  THEM  ARE  NAMES HE  NEVER HEARD  OF. I  WOULD  GET  THESE GUYS  TO  GO  AND NEGOTIATE --  YOU'VE  GOT  CHINA, MAKE  A  GOOD  DEAL. CHINA DOESN'T  HAVE  A  CHANCE. THIS IS  AN  WITH  CAROLINE. THESE ARE  THE  BEST. WE  HAVE  THE  BEST  IN  THE  WORLD AND  WE  DON'T  USE  THEM. WE DON'T  USE  OUR  BEST  AND BRIGHTEST AND  SHARPEST AND  IT'S A  BIG, BIG  PROBLEM.   JUST  SO YOU KNOW, WITH  COUNTRIES LIKE  CHINA AND OTHERS, ESPECIALLY  THE  ASIAN COUNTRIES. THIS  IS  NOT  BASED  ON  NICENESS. THEY  HAVE A  WONDERFUL PERSONALITY  OR  THEY HELP SOMEBODY  OR  THEY  GIVE  CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS  AND  THEREFORE THEY GET  A  JOB. THIS  IS  NOT  ABOUT  THAT. IN  THOSE  COUNTRIES,  THEY  TAKE THE  SMARTEST, SMARTEST -- THE ONE WHO  IS  WINNING,  WINNING, WINNING AND  THAT'S  WHAT  WE  HAVE TO  DEAL WITH. WE  CAN  HAVE  THESE  BABIES  THAT DON'T  HAVE A  CLUE  NEGOTIATING DEALS. WE HAVE ALL THE  CARDS  AGAINST CHINA AND  OTHER  COUNTRIES BECAUSE WITHOUT  US,  THEY  WOULD HAVE  A  DEPRESSION  THE  LIKES  OF WHICH YOU'VE  NEVER  SEEN. BELIEVE ME. WE  HAVE  THE  CARDS. WE  HAVE  PEOPLE  THAT  DON'T  KNOW THAT WE  HAVE  THE  CARDS. HOW DO  YOU  CUT  OFF SANCTIONS  AND THEN  GO  INTO  A  NEGOTIATION WITH IRAN? YOU  DOUBLE  OR  TRIPLE  THE SANCTIONS. THAT'S  WHY  THEY  LAUGH AT  US. HE  IS  SAYING EVERYTHING  WE  SAID IS  A  LIE. WE  HAVE  A  GREAT  AGREEMENT. IF  SOMEBODY  DID  THAT TO ME,  I WOULD  SAY  MAYBE  YOU  ARE  RIGHT, THE  DEAL  IS  OFF. I  CAN'T  BELIEVE THEY  ARE  SO BRAZEN. I  WOULD  GO  IN  AND SAY ""YOU'RE FIRED."" THANK  YOU.   HOW  DO  YOU NEGOTIATE  WITH  PEOPLE THAT  MAKE A  DEAL  AND  THEN  DO THAT?  TERRIBLE. ANOTHER QUESTION  AND  THEN  WE WILL CALL  IT  QUITS. GO  AHEAD.  >> SEVERAL YEARS  AGO,  YOU  WERE GOING  TO BUILD  A RESTAURANT  DOWN AT  JONES  BEACH  IN  NEW  YORK. OUR  WONDERFUL GOVERNOR  GAVE  YOU A  MISERABLE MISERABLE  TIME. I UNDERSTAND  WHY  YOU  PULLED  OUT OF  THAT  DEAL. WHAT  CONCERNS ME IS,  THERE  WERE A  LOT  OF  PEOPLE WHO  WERE FIGHTING  FOR  YOU. AFTER HURRICANE IRENE AND SANDY, QUITE CLEARLY  THE  BASE  OF BUILDING WOULD  HAVE  BEEN --  >> I  WAS  GOING TO  DO  IT AND  WAS SENT  TO  START  CONSTRUCTION AND THEN  HURRICANE  SANDY  CAME ALONG AND  WIPED  OUT  JONES  BEACH. YOU WOULD  NOT  HAVE CARS. MY  INSURANCE  COMPANY  OFFERED ME A  DEAL  THAT  I  COULD  NOT REFUSE. THEY  OFFERED ME  A  DEAL  AND  I SAID,  WELL,  THAT'S PRETTY  GOOD. WHY SHOULD  I  BUILD  IT? DOES THAT  MAKE  SENSE? I'M  NOT  A  BIG FAN  OF WHAT'S GOING  ON  WITH  FRACKING AND  ALL THE  THINGS  THAT  THEY  ARE SCREWING  UP  IN  NEW  YORK. THEY  WANTED  ME  TO  DO  THAT  DEAL. WHEN HURRICANE  SANDY  CAME  ALONG, I  DECIDED NOT  TO  DO  IT  BECAUSE JONES BEACH  WAS WIPED  OUT  AND STILL  HAS  NOT RECOVERED. WE  WILL  DO  ONE  MORE  QUESTION. GO  AHEAD,  SIR. NICE-LOOKING  GUY. SCREAM IT.  >> ""YOU'RE HIRED!"" DONALD:  THANK  YOU  VERY  MUCH. I  REALLY  APPRECIATE  YOUR ENTHUSIASM. WE  WILL  MAKE  THIS  COUNTRY  GREAT AGAIN. THANK  YOU  VERY MUCH. THANK  YOU.          ","Republican Leadership Summit, Donald Trump"

BENGHAZI. EVERYTHING  IS  BENGHAZI. WHAT HAPPENS? NOTHING. IRS,  E-MAILS, I  GET  SUED  ALL  THE TIME. IT  IS  HARD FOR  PERSON WHO  IS SUCCESSFUL. I  HAVE DONE  MANY  DEALS. MOST  OF  THEM HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. YOU  WILL  SEE  THAT WHEN I  FILE  MY STATEMENTS. YOU  WILL  BE VERY  PROUD. I  SAID  STRONGLY  IT  IS  HARD FOR SOMEONE  WHO HAS  DONE  TREMENDOUS NUMBERS  OF DEALS  TO  RUN FOR  THE LYRICAL  OFFICE. ANY OFFICE, NOT  JUST  PRESIDENT. YOU  HAVE  BEATEN SO  MANY PEOPLE AND CREATED --  OBAMA,  WHAT  DID HE  DO? NO  DEAL. HE  DID ONE DEAL. A  HOUSE. IF  YOU  DID  THAT HOUSE  YOU  WOULD BE  IN JAIL. HE  GOT  AWAY  WITH  MURDER. THOUSANDS OF  IRS E-MAILS WERE LOST. IF  YOU  ARE  IN MY WORLD YOU  WOULD KNOW  THAT  E-MAILS CANNOT  BE LOST. WHY  ARE OUR POLITICIANS  NOT FINDING  OUT  WHERE THE  E-MAILS ARE? THEY  TALK  ABOUT  EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND  IMMIGRATION. THEY TALK ABOUT STOPPING  IT AT THE  BORDER. IF  I  DID SOMETHING YOU  WOULD HAVE A BORDER. THEN  YOU  HAVE A  PRESIDENT  WHO DOES AN EXECUTIVE  ORDER. NO ONE  EVEN  HEARD OF  AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. HE DOES  IT  TO  LET PEOPLE COME  IN AND  NO  ONE  DOES  ANYTHING ABOUT EXECUTIVE ORDERS. WHY DIDN'T  THEY  GO  TO  COURT  AND ASK  FOR  CLAIRE  TERRY  JUDGMENT.  -- AND AS  FOR  JUDGMENT. HE'S  BEEN  SAYING,  I  WILL APPROVE THIS  AND  THAT. WHY  DIDN'T OUR REPUBLICANS  GET  A DECLARED TERRI --  GET  A DECLARATORY  JUDGMENT? INSTEAD  THEY  HAVE A WEEK  LAWSUIT  -- A WEAK  LAWSUIT  BY THE  TIME  IT IS  FINISHED  IN  EIGHT  YEARS EVERYONE  WILL  FORGET  AND  WE WILL BE  IN  A DIFFERENT  MODE. AND OUR  COUNTRY  WILL  BE  FURTHER DESTROYED. JOBS, CHINA,  I  HAVE MADE  SO  MUCH MONEY  FIGHTING  AGAINST THE CHINESE. ONE OF  MY  BEST DEALS  WAS  AGAINST THE  CHINESE  AND  THEY  RESPECT ME FOR  IT. I  KNOW  THAT. THEY SAY  I  CANNOT BELIEVE  WHAT WE  ARE  GETTING  AWAY WITH. WE  CAN'T BELIEVE  HOW  STUPID  YOUR LEADERS ARE. THEY  TOLD  ME THAT. THEY  DON'T KNOW  I  WILL  MAKE  A SPEECH,  BUT  WHY NOT. THEY  TELL  ME  THAT. I  DON'T  KNOW IF  YOU  KNOW  WHAT  IS HAPPENING WITH  THE  DEVALUATION OF  SO  MANY COUNTRIES. CHINA  IS  GOING CRAZY WITH DEVALUATION. THEY  ARE DEVALUING  DOWN  TO NOTHING. THAT  WILL  MAKE IT  IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO  SELL YOUR  PRODUCT. IT  WILL  MAKE  IT IMPOSSIBLE  FOR YOU  TO COMPETE. THEY  WOULD NOT  HAVE  DONE  IT  TWO YEARS  AGO,  BUT  NOW  THEY  FEEL  WE ARE  SO WEAK  AS SO  MANY  DIFFERENT PROBLEMS  THEY CAN  DO IT. YOU  WATCH  THIS  DEVALUATION  OF ALL  OF IT. THE  EURO. CHINA, MEXICO,  EVERYONE  IS DEVALUING. WHEN  YOU HEAR THE  DOLLAR  IS GETTING  STRONGER IT  SOUNDS  GOOD. BE  VERY  CAREFUL. THE  VERY CAREFUL. WE  WILL LOSE MORE  AND MORE BUSINESS  TO  FOREIGN  COUNTRIES WHO KNOW  WHAT  THEY  ARE  DOING. THEY HAVE  IT SET. DON'T  FORGET  CHINA  BECAME THE NUMBER  ONE  ECONOMIC  POWER A  YEAR AGO. THAT  WAS  UNTHINKABLE. TO  THINK THAT  WOULD HAPPEN. IT WAS UNTHINKABLE. IT  HAPPENED AND  IT  IS  VERY  SAD. WE  SPENT $2 TRILLION  IN  YOUR RACK.  -- IN IRAQ. WE  GOT  NOTHING. THEY  DON'T EVEN CARE  UNTIL  THEY STARTED  GETTING THEIR ASK  KICKED  -- THEIR ASS  KICKED  AND  THEN THEY ASKED. AND  THEN THEY  GOT  ISIS. ISIS  TOOK  OVER  THE  OIL. HAVE  I  BEEN SAYING  FOR  YEARS, KEEP  THE OIL. NOW  ISIS  HAS  THE  OIL. WHAT  ISIS DOESN'T  HAVE YOU -- WHAT  ISIS DOESN'T HAVE IRAN  WILL TAKE. I  WALKED  ON  THE  STREETS  OF  NEW YORK  AND  I  SEE  SO  MANY  WOUNDED WARRIORS. WE HAVE  TO HELP  THOSE  PEOPLE. OUR  VETERANS. OUR  MILITARY. WE  HAVE  TO  BUILD  OUR  MILITARY. WE HAVE  TO  DO IT  FAST. WE  HAVE  INCOMPETENT PEOPLE. THEY  PUT  PEOPLE IN CHARGE  THAT HAVE NO  CLUE  WHAT  THEY  ARE DOING. WE HAVE  TO  MAKE OUR  COUNTRY RICH SO  WE  CAN  SAVE  SOCIAL  SECURITY. I  WILL PROBABLY  BE  THE ONLY REPUBLICAN THAT DOES  NOT  WANT TO CUT  SOCIAL  SECURITY. I  WANT  TO MAKE  THE  COUNTRY RICH SO  SOCIAL  SECURITY CAN BE AFFORDED. GET  WIT  OF  THE WASTE  AND FRAUD, BUT  YOU  DESERVE  YOUR  SOCIAL SECURITY. I  LIKE CONGRESSMAN RYAN  AND THE  PEOPLE  TALKING ABOUT  CUTTING SOCIAL  SECURITY. THE  DEMOCRATS ARE  EATING  YOUR LUNCH  ON THIS ISSUE. YOU  HAVE  TO  MAKE  THE  COUNTRY RICH  AND STRONG  SO  YOU  CAN AFFORD IT, AND  SO YOU  CAN  AFFORD MILITARY, AND  ALL  OF THE  OTHER THINGS. WE  HAVE A  GAME  CHANGER, NUCLEAR WEAPONS. WE  HAVE  TO  GET  STRONG FAST. WE  CANNOT LET IRAN  GET  A  NUCLEAR WEAPON. WE  CAN'T DO  IT.   WE  CANNOT LET THAT  HAPPEN. IN  THE  OLD  DAYS I  WOULD  HAVE SAID,  100, 50,  30 YEARS AGO, PULL  OUT  AND  LET THEM  FIGHT  EACH OTHER. WE  ARE IN SYRIA. WE  ARE FIGHTING ISIS,  BUT  ISIS WANTS  TO  OVERTURN THE GOVERNMENT  . LET  THEM  FIGHT  AND  TAKE  OUT  THE ONE  THAT  REMAINS. THINK OF IT. THINK OF  IT. ISIS IS  FIGHTING  THEM  AND  WE  ARE BOMBING, BUT  WE  WANT SYRIA  TO FALL. THERE  ARE SO  MANY  THINGS. THE ONE  GAME CHANGER  WE  HAVE  TO BE  CAREFUL WITH, THAT  WE  NEVER HAD  TO  THINK ABOUT  TOO  MUCH BEFORE OTHER  THAN  A  CERTAIN NUMBER OF  YEARS  AGO  IS  THE NUCLEAR. IT IS  NOT JUST SOLDIERS  IN UNIFORMS  SHOOTING RIFLES. YOU  CAN  TAKE OUT  THE EAST  COAST OF THIS  COUNTRY,  LARGE  SECTIONS OF  THE MIDWEST,  THINGS  THAT  WERE UNTHINKABLE. THE  POWER. WE  HAVE  TO BE  IN  A  POSITION WHERE  THAT  NEVER,  EVER, EVER, EVER  HAPPENS. WE  HAVE  NEVER  HAD  THIS BEFORE. WE  ARE  SPENDING A  TREMENDOUS AMOUNT  OF  MONEY  IN  AFGHANISTAN TRYING  TO  DO  THE  RIGHT THING. NO  LEADERSHIP RESPECTS  US. LEADERSHIP  OF OTHER  PLACES  NEVER RESPECT  STUPID  PEOPLE. THE  SAME  THING IS  HAPPENING THERE. I NEVER  KNEW THAT AFGHANISTAN HAS  TREMENDOUS  WEALTH  AND MINERALS. NOT  OIL, BUT MINERALS. WE  ARE  FIGHTING  HERE. ON  THE OTHER  SIDE  OF  THE MOUNTAIN  CHINA  IS TAKING OUT  ALL OF  THE  MINERALS. TRILLIONS OF  DOLLARS  AND BILLIONS  OF DOLLARS  OF  MINERALS. WE  ARE  FIGHTING HERE, AND  THEY ARE TAKING  IT  OUT, LOOKING AT  US AND  SAYING  THANK  YOU  VERY MUCH SOCCER.  --  THANK  YOU VERY MUCH  SUCKER. IT  IS VERY CRAZY. WE  HAVE TO  QUICKLY  REBUILD  OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. IF  WE  DO NOT,  THE  OTHER  DAY  IN OHIO  A  BRIDGE COLLAPSED. BRIDGES  ARE  COLLAPSING ALL  OVER THE  COUNTRY. WHAT IS  HAPPENING  WITH  OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. I  GO  TO SAUDI ARABIA, DUBAI,  I AM  DOING BIG  JOBS IN DUBAI. I'M  GOING TO VARIOUS PLACES. I  GO  TO  CHINA. THEY ARE  BUILDING  BRIDGES  ON EVERY CORNER. THEY  ARE  BUILDING  THE  MOST INCREDIBLE THINGS  YOU  HAVE  EVER SEEN. THEY  ARE  BUILDING AIRPORTS IN QATAR. THEY ARE  BUILDING AN AIRPORT THE LIKES OF WHICH YOU  HAVE  NEVER SEEN. IN DUBAI,  AN  AIRPORT  THE  LIKES OF WHICH  YOU  HAVE  NEVER SEEN. THEN  I  COME  BACK TO LAGUARDIA WHERE THE RUNWAYS HAVE  POTHOLES. IN  THE  MAIN  TERMINAL  TO  HAVE A FLOOR  SO  OLD  IT  IS  FALLING APART. THEY  HAVE  A  HOLE  IN IT,  AND  THEY REPLACE IT  WITH ASPHALT.  YOU HAVE  A  WHITE  FOR WITH ASPHALT INSIDE. I  JUST  LEFT  DUBAI  WHERE  THEY HAVE  THE  MOST INCREDIBLE THING. MY  PILOT SAID  THIS  IS AN  HONOR. I  SAID  IT  IS NOT  AN  HONOR,  THEY ARE SMART. YOU LOOK AT  LAX, KENNEDY AIRPORT,  AND  OUR  AIRPORTS GENERALLY. YOU  LOOK  AT OUR  CRUMBLING ROADWAYS. I  WILL  GIVE  YOU AN  EXAMPLE. THIS  IS  NOT  PART  OF  WHAT  I  WAS GOING  TO  SAY,  BUT I  RIDE  DOWN THE  HIGHWAYS AND  SOMEONE  MAKES THE  GUARD RAILS. THE  ONES THAT  GO LIKE  THIS. THEY  ARE BENT,  RESTED,  AND HORRIBLE. HAVE  YOU  EVER  SEEN MORE  THAN  20 FEET THAT  IS  NOT  CORRODED, EVENT,  OR  CRUSHES  IN THE  HEAT. THEY  OF  THE  DOING THIS  FOR  25 YEARS. WHY  DOESN'T  SOMEONE STOP  THEM AND  GET  SOMETHING  THAT  WORKS. SOMEONE MADE  A  LOT  OF  MONEY  ON THAT. THEY DON'T  KNOW  WHAT  IS HAPPENING. WE  HAVE  TO  MAKE  OUR COUNTRY GREAT. WE  HAVE  TO  REBUILD OUR  COUNTRY. WE  HAVE  A  LONG  WAY TO  GO. WE  ARE  IN  SUCH SERIOUS  TROUBLE BECAUSE  WE  KNOW SO  MUCH  MONEY. WE KNOW IT  TO  THE  CHINESE. WE KNOW IT -- WE OWE  IT  TO  THE CHINESE. WE OWE IT  TO  OTHER  COUNTRIES. NO AMERICAN  COMPANY COMES TO BID. NORTH  KOREA. WHEN  THEY  HAVE A  PROBLEM WE  GO AND PROTECT  THEM. WHY  AREN'T  THEY PAYING  US. IN THIS CASE, TELEVISION  AND SOUTH KOREA. WHY  AREN'T  THEY  DOING  SOMETHING TO  JUSTIFY  WHAT  IS  GOING  ON? WE  HAVE  A  VERY  IMPORTANT ELECTION  COMING UP. WE  HAVE  A  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. WE  HAVE  GOOD  PEOPLE. COMING UP. WE  HAVE  SOME  GOOD PEOPLE. THEY  CANNOT BE MITT -- HE  RAN AND FAILED. HE FAILED. LOOK --  LIKE  HIM  OR DISLIKE HIM   --  THE  47% STATEMENT  HE  MADE,  THAT  IS  NOT GOING AWAY. THE ROMNEY CARE --  THAT  IS  NOT GOING AWAY. MORE  IMPORTANTLY, HE CHOKED. SOMETHING  HAPPENED TO HIM. HE  HAD  THE ELECTION WANTS. LET  ME  TELL YOU SOMETHING -- IT'S  LIKE  THE  DEALMAKER  THAT CAN'T  MAKE  THE  DEAL --  I  KNOW  A LOT  OF  THOSE GUYS. THEY  CANNOT  THINK THE  THREE FOOTER. THERE  ARE  MANY OF THEM. MOST PEOPLE  ARE LIKE THAT. YOU  CANNOT  GIVE SOMEONE  ANOTHER CHANCE. I THINK  THIS ELECTION  IS  TOUGHER  THAN  WAITING TO  A  FAILED  PRESIDENT. YOU CANNOT  HAVE  GROWN THE. HE CHOKED. YOU  CANNOT HAVE BUSH. THE  LAST  THING  WE  NEED  IS  ANOTHER BUSH. I  MADE  THAT  STATEMENT  VERY STRONGLY. I  WILL BE ACCUSED --  I  SAID  IT  FIRST. I  MEAN IT. THE  LAST  THING  WE  NEED  IS ANOTHER BUSH. HE  IS  TOTALLY  IN  FAVOR  OF COMMON CORE. HE  IS VERY  WEAK ON IMMIGRATION. DON'T FORGET --  REMEMBER HIS STATEMENT --  THEY  COME TO LOVE. I SAID, WHAT? HALF  OF  THESE  PEOPLE ARE CRIMINALS --  TTHEY ARE  COMING  FOR LOVE? THEY'RE  COMING FOR  A  LOT  OF  OTHER  REASONS AND  IS  NOT LOVE. WHEN  HE  RUNS, YOU  HAVE  TO  REMEMBER, HIS  BROTHER  GAVE US OBAMA. ABRAHAM  LINCOLN COMING  HOME -- BACK  FROM  THE  DEAD  COULD  NOT  HAVE GIVEN  US  A  DIFFERENT ELECTION. THEN, HE  APPOINTED  JUSTICE ROBERTS. JEB WANTED JUSTICE ROBERTS. JUSTICE ROBERTS  BASICALLY  APPROVED OBAMACARE. YOU CANNOT  HAVE  JED BUSH. BESIDES THAT,  HE  WILL  NOT WIN. MITT -- YOU  JUST  CANNOT  HAVE  THOSE TWO. THAT'S ALL.   JUST  IN  SUMMING UP. I WROTE  A  FEW  POINTS DOWN. I  WATCH  THESE TELEPROMPTERS. BY  THE  WAY, I  THINK  ANY  PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE THAT  RUNS  SHOULD  NOT  BE  ALLOWED TO  USE  THE  TELEPROMPTER.   WE  GOT  ONE  THAT  USES TELEPROMPTERS. PEOPLE  SAY,  HE  IS SO  QUICK  ON  HIS  FEET. HE  IS  READING IT. YOU  DO  NOT  TEST  THE METTLE  OF  A  MAN  OR  WOMAN  UNLESS THEY  CAN  GET  UP  ON  STAGE  AND TALK. THAT  IS  WHAT  WE  END  UP GETTING   --  THE  KING OF TELEPROMPTERS. WHEN I  LOOK  AT  THESE  THINGS  HERE  I  SAID, IT  WOULD  BE  SO NICE --  BEING -- BING,  BING, BING. WE  HAVE  TO  DO  SOMETHING ABOUT  THE TELEPROMPTERS. IN  LOOKING AT THESE SITUATIONS   -- I  BUILT  AN  INCREDIBLE COMPANY --  YOU WILL  SEE THAT. I  EMPLOY  THOUSANDS OF  PEOPLE  AND  I  LOVE  DOING WHAT  I'M  DOING. IN  A  CERTAIN WAY,  I HOPE  I'M NOT DOING  THIS,  BUT  OUR  COUNTRY  IS  IN SUCH  TROUBLE,  WE  HAVE SO  MUCH POTENTIAL. IF  I  RUN  FOR  PRESENT  AND  IF  I  WIN, I  WOULD  SUCCEED  IN CREATING JOBS,  DEFEATING  ISIS,  AND  STOPPING THE  ISLAMIC TERRORISTS -- AAND  YOU  HAVE  TO  DO THAT.   REDUCING THE  BUDGET DEFICIT -- SOMEONE  HAS  TO  DO IT. SECURING OUR SOUTHERN BORDER,  AND  I  MEAN,  SERIOUSLY SECURING IT. STOPPING NUCLEAR  WEAPONS  IN  IRAN AND ELSEWHERE.   SAVING SOCIAL  SECURITY,  MEDICARE, AND  MEDICAID,  WITHOUT  CUTTING IT  DOWN  TO THE  BONES  BECAUSE  IT  IS NOT  FAIR  TO  PEOPLE  WHO  HAVE  BEEN PAYING  ALL  THEIR LIVES. AND  IT  IS  NOT  FAIR TO  FUTURE  PEOPLE  COMING  UP,  AND WE  CAN  DO IT. REPEALING  OBAMACARE AND  REPLACING  IT  WITH  SOMETHING FAR  BETTER --  FOR  THE PEOPLE --  AND  FAR LESS EXPENSIVE --  BOTH  FOR THE  PEOPLE  AND  FOR  THE COUNTRY. AND BELIEVE  ME,  THERE  ARE  PLANS ARE  SO  MUCH  BETTER  FOR EVERYBODY. AND  EVERYBODY CAN  BE COVERED. I'M  NOT  SAYING LEAVE  50%  OF  THE  PEOPLE OUT. THIS  PLAN  IS A DISASTER. AS  BAD  AS THE  WEBSITE  WAS,  THIS  IS  HOW BAD  THE  PLAN  IS.   FIXING  A COUNTRY'S INFRASTRUCTURE -- OUR  BRIDGES, OUR  SCHOOLS,  OUR AIRPORTS. THAT  I  CAN TELL  YOU,  NO ONE  IS  CLOSE TO TRUMP. I  JUST  GOT THE  BEST  HOTEL  IN  NORTH AMERICA. I'M  BUILDING ONE OF  THE  GREATEST HOTELS  IN  THE  WORLD  ON PENNSYLVANIA  AVENUE --  OPPOSITE THE  WHITE HOUSE. I  GOT  IT FROM OBAMA. CAN  YOU BELIEVE THAT? EVERYBODY WANTED IT. I CAN'T  BELIEVE  IT  MYSELF  BUT  IT WILL BE FANTASTIC. SO  MANY  OTHER THINGS. I  KNOW  WHAT  NEEDS  TO BE  DONE TO  MAKE  AMERICA  GREAT AGAIN. WE  CAN  MAKE  THIS  COUNTRY  GREAT AGAINST. THE  POTENTIAL  IS ENORMOUS. I'M  SERIOUSLY  THINKING OF  RUNNING FOR  PRESIDENT  BECAUSE  I  CAN DO  THE  JOB. THANK  YOU  VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.   THANK  YOU  VERY  MUCH, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU.   BEAUTIFUL. THANK","Iowa Freedom Summit, Donald Trump"
